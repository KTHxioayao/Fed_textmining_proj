"2018-03-21","We’re going to use monetary policy as the principle tool of adjusting, you know, our policy.","Q&A","Press Conf","","16","2018-03"
"2018-03-21","We announced it, and we said we wouldn’t change it, really, unless there were a significant downturn that required, you know, meaningful reductions in interest rates.","Q&A","Press Conf","","26","2018-03"
"2018-03-21","I think in the tax bill there’s—there are incentives for—there—a tax cut bill that allows expensing of investments should encourage additional investment that should encourage productivity.","Q&A","Press Conf","","26","2018-03"
"2018-03-21","Our current framework for implementing monetary policy is working very well.","Q&A","Press Conf","","11","2018-03"
"2018-03-21","I would say in the bill that passed Congress, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, there were elements that should encourage productivity, as I mentioned—sorry, encourage investment, which should help productivity, encourage labor force participation.","Q&A","Press Conf","","35","2018-03"
"2018-03-21","So, you know, I think it’s really important that we do something—do what we can as a country to increase our potential growth rate.","Q&A","Press Conf","","24","2018-03"
"2018-03-21","You know, we’ve been through many years of growth around 2 percent, and I’ve given a number of public remarks where I’ve called on, you know, the country to focus more on potential growth and productivity and labor force participation, which drive potential growth.","Q&A","Press Conf","","44","2018-03"
"2018-03-21","So I do think it’s very important that we have a focus on productivity in the country.","Q&A","Press Conf","","17","2018-03"
"2018-03-21","And, you know, you asked me about fiscal policy and the connection to productivity.","Q&A","Press Conf","","14","2018-03"
"2018-03-21","In terms of productivity—productivity, as I’m sure you know, has been very weak since the financial crisis.","Q&A","Press Conf","","17","2018-03"
"2018-03-21","It just is that we’re always going to be seeking 2 percent unemployment from its goal.","Q&A","Press Conf","","16","2018-03"
"2018-03-21","And, I think it’s—I wouldn’t characterize what we’ve done over the last five years as tolerating, you know, an undershoot of inflation.","Q&A","Press Conf","","22","2018-03"
"2018-03-21","You know, so as you noted, the—what we’ve said in the longer-run statement of goals and monetary policy strategy is that we would be concerned with sustained or persistent deviations of inflation either above or below.","Q&A","Press Conf","","36","2018-03"
"2018-03-21","We need that, and it’s, you know, we need to make sure that inflation expectations are anchored at 2 percent.","Q&A","Press Conf","","20","2018-03"
"2018-03-21","So I think when you see those small changes in unemployment, that simply reflects the, you know, the flatness of the Phillips curve, if you will.","Q&A","Press Conf","","26","2018-03"
"2018-03-21","And that suggests that the relationship between changes in slack and inflation is not so tight.","Q&A","Press Conf","","16","2018-03"
"2018-03-21","You’ve only seen very gradual upward pressures on inflation and wages despite that very large increase.","Q&A","Press Conf","","16","2018-03"
"2018-03-21","And I think that reflects, essentially—if you think back to the era after the crisis, unemployment was 10 percent.","Q&A","Press Conf","","19","2018-03"
"2018-03-21","The Committee’s estimates of growth went up, the Committee’s estimates of unemployment went down, and there was a very slight increase in inflation.","Q&A","Press Conf","","23","2018-03"
"2018-03-21","Longer-run values like the neutral rate of interest, the natural rate of unemployment, the potential growth rate of the economy are pinned down by slow- moving forces over time.","Q&A","Press Conf","","29","2018-03"
"2018-03-21","I guess the idea—the theory would be that if you get below the sustainable rate of unemployment for a sustained","Q&A","Press Conf","","20","2018-03"
"2018-03-21","We have seen moderate increases in wages and price inflation, and we seem to be seeing more of that.","Q&A","Press Conf","","19","2018-03"
"2018-03-21","As I mentioned earlier, there is no—there’s no sense in the data that we’re on the cusp of an acceleration of inflation.","Q&A","Press Conf","","22","2018-03"
"2018-03-21","As they see unemployment going lower, they’re looking at a variety of aspects of the labor market, including wage inflation and price inflation.","Q&A","Press Conf","","23","2018-03"
"2018-03-21","So as the—as the actual unemployment rate has declined from 10 percent to 4.1 percent, the Committee’s median estimate of the natural rate of unemployment has also declined by a full percentage point.","Q&A","Press Conf","","33","2018-03"
"2018-03-21","So I guess I’d start by saying that the natural rate of unemployment is not something that we can observe directly.","Q&A","Press Conf","","21","2018-03"
"2018-03-21","You know, I would say it’s hard to say, but it would take—you know, that is well above almost all estimates, current estimates of potential long-run growth.","Q&A","Press Conf","","27","2018-03"
"2018-03-21","So, as—if inflation—if unemployment does continue to go down, we’ll continue to do that.","Q&A","Press Conf","","14","2018-03"
"2018-03-21","I think it’s true that yield curves have tended to predict recessions if you look back over many cycles, but a lot of that was just situations in which inflation was allowed to get out of control, and the Fed had to tighten, and that put the economy into a recession.","Q&A","Press Conf","","51","2018-03"
"2018-03-21","You can count on us to stay focused on the jobs that Congress has assigned us and count on us to use the tools we have to achieve them.","Q&A","Press Conf","","29","2018-03"
"2018-03-21","You know, we—we’re looking very carefully at our assigned responsibilities of maximum employment, stable prices, and that’s really our focus.","Q&A","Press Conf","","20","2018-03"
"2018-03-21","Market-based measures of inflation compensation had increased in recent months but remained low; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations were little changed, on balance.","Participants' Views","Minutes","N/A","24","2018-03"
"2018-03-21","On the other hand, as the market has tightened, as labor markets have tightened, and we hear reports of labor shortages and we see that, you know, groups of unemployed are diminishing, and the unemployment rate is going down, we haven’t seen, you know, higher wages—wages going up more.","Q&A","Press Conf","","49","2018-03"
"2018-03-21","And productivity’s been very low.","Q&A","Press Conf","","5","2018-03"
"2018-03-21","You should get paid for your productivity plus inflation.","Q&A","Press Conf","","9","2018-03"
"2018-03-21","So, on the one hand, what wages should in theory represent is inflation plus productivity increases.","Q&A","Press Conf","","16","2018-03"
"2018-03-21","As I mentioned, you know, we’ve had unemployment decline sharply since, I guess, 2010, when it peaked at 10 percent and down to 4.1 percent now, and we’ve seen only modest increases in wages.","Q&A","Press Conf","","34","2018-03"
"2018-03-21","They didn’t get into talking about particular—you know, whether it’s inflation or growth or whatever it would be.","Q&A","Press Conf","","18","2018-03"
"2018-03-21","In terms of what’s the right level, I don’t think I have a view on what the right level of wages is, but I think we will—we will know that the labor market is getting tight when we do see a more meaningful upward move in wages.","Q&A","Press Conf","","47","2018-03"
"2018-03-21","On a 12-month basis, both overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy had continued to run below 2 percent.","Participants' Views","Minutes","N/A","23","2018-03"
"2018-03-21","Recent data suggested that growth rates of household spending and business fixed investment had moderated from their strong fourth-quarter readings.","Participants' Views","Minutes","N/A","20","2018-03"

"2018-03-21","The deputy manager of the System Open Market Account (SOMA) provided a summary of developments in domestic and global financial markets over the intermeeting period; she also reported on open market operations and related issues.","Developments in Financial Markets","Minutes","N/A","35","2018-03"
"2018-03-21","Financial markets experienced a notable bout of volatility early in the intermeeting period; volatility was particularly pronounced in equity markets.","Developments in Financial Markets","Minutes","N/A","20","2018-03"
"2018-03-21","Market participants pointed to incoming economic data released in early February--particularly data on average hourly earnings--as raising concerns about the prospects for higher inflation and higher interest rates.","Developments in Financial Markets","Minutes","N/A","28","2018-03"
"2018-03-21","These concerns reportedly contributed to a steep decline in equity prices and an associated rise in measures of volatility.","Developments in Financial Markets","Minutes","N/A","19","2018-03"
"2018-03-21","Measures of equity market volatility declined over subsequent weeks but remained above levels that prevailed earlier in the year, and stock prices finished lower, on net, over the intermeeting period.","Developments in Financial Markets","Minutes","N/A","30","2018-03"
"2018-03-21","Interest rates rose modestly over the period.","Developments in Financial Markets","Minutes","N/A","7","2018-03"
"2018-03-21","Respondents to the Open Market Desk's surveys of primary dealers and market participants suggested that revisions in investors' views regarding the fiscal outlook were an important factor boosting yields and contributing to a slightly steeper expected trajectory of the federal funds rate.","Developments in Financial Markets","Minutes","N/A","42","2018-03"
"2018-03-21","The deputy manager noted that a rapid and sizable increase in Treasury bill issuance over recent weeks had put upward pressure on money market yields over the period.","Developments in Financial Markets","Minutes","N/A","28","2018-03"

"2018-03-21","The near-term forecast for real GDP growth was revised down a little; the incoming spending data were a bit softer than the staff had expected, and the staff judged that the softness was not associated with residual seasonality in the data.","Staff Economic Outlook","Minutes","N/A","41","2018-03"
"2018-03-21","However, the slowing in the pace of spending in the first quarter was expected to be transitory, and the medium-term projection for GDP growth was revised up modestly, largely reflecting the expected boost to GDP from the federal budget agreement enacted in February.","Staff Economic Outlook","Minutes","N/A","43","2018-03"

"2018-03-21","For example, one—in the long-run, the size of the balance sheet is going to depend on the public’s demand for our liabilities, including currency and reserves.","Q&A","Press Conf","","26","2018-03"
"2018-03-21","So we don’t know what the demand is for reserves in a world where you have—you know, you have regulations that require banks to hold lots of high-quality liquid assets, and reserves are one of those.","Q&A","Press Conf","","36","2018-03"
"2018-03-21","pay interest on excess reserves that are—is above the general level of short-term interest rates.","Q&A","Press Conf","","15","2018-03"
"2018-03-21","So we’re paying rates that banks can get from other interest rates from other—any other investment in the short-term money markets.","Q&A","Press Conf","","21","2018-03"
"2018-03-21","We regularly use that to—as a way to test against various, you know, market shocks, certainly for the larger institutions.","Q&A","Press Conf","","20","2018-03"

"2018-03-21","So, you know, we—regular way commercial banks that do deposit taking and lending and don’t speculate in markets, you know, that’s one business model.","Q&A","Press Conf","","24","2018-03"
"2018-03-21","If I could try to summarize, it would be that, I think, broadly speaking, participants believe there will be meaningful increases in demand from the new fiscal policies for at least the next, let’s say, three years.","Q&A","Press Conf","","37","2018-03"
"2018-03-21","I think there’s a general view as well that supply-side issues—that there could be supply-side effects as well, and you would see that again through higher investment, driven by lower corporate tax rates and the expensing of some investment, which would drive—tend to drive productivity over time.","Q&A","Press Conf","","47","2018-03"
"2018-03-21","It isn’t the only factor or the principle factor, but it should result in more investment, and investment should drive productivity.","Q&A","Press Conf","","21","2018-03"
"2018-04-06","At the same time, the absence of a sharper acceleration in wages suggests that the labor market is not excessively tight.","General","Speech","N/A","21","2018-04"

"2018-10-02","As I discussed in a recent speech, many analysts have accounted for the lack of rising inflation pressure by lowering their estimate of the natural rate.19For example, since the start of 2016, the unemployment rate has fallen about 1 percentage point, and estimates of the natural rate from four well-known sources have fallen over that period between 0.3 percent and 0.7 percent (figure 9).","General","Speech","N/A","64","2018-10"

"2018-10-02","Some argue the contrary case--that by only gradually removing accommodation as the unemployment rate has fallen, the FOMC may have fallen behind the curve, thereby risking an upward drift in expectations.","General","Speech","N/A","31","2018-10"

"2018-10-02","The survey measures have been particularly steady for some time.15The financial market-based measures include both an expectations component and a volatile inflation premium component, so they tend to move around much more than the surveys, but we see no evidence of a material change in these measures, either.","General","Speech","N/A","48","2018-10"
"2018-10-02","From the standpoint of contingency planning, our course is clear: Resolutely conduct policy consistent with the FOMC's symmetric 2 percent inflation objective, and stand ready to act with authority if expectations drift materially up or down.","General","Speech","N/A","36","2018-10"
"2018-10-02","As you probably know from our public communications, we carefully monitor survey- and market-based proxies for expectations, and we do not see evidence of a material shift in longer-term expectations (figure 6).","General","Speech","N/A","32","2018-10"
"2018-10-02","We attribute a great deal of the stability of inflation in recent years to the anchoring of longer-term inflation expectations.","General","Speech","N/A","20","2018-10"
"2018-10-02","Could Inflation Expectations Become Unanchored?First is the risk that inflation expectations might lose their anchor.","General","Speech","N/A","15","2018-10"
"2018-10-02","Instead, the outlook is consistent with evidence of a very flat Phillips curve and inflation expectations anchored near 2 percent.","General","Speech","N/A","20","2018-10"

"2018-10-02","Could Inflation Pressures Move up More than Expected in a Hot Economy?A second risk is that labor market tightness or tightness in other parts of the production chain might lead to higher inflation pressure than expected--the ""revenge of the Phillips curve"" scenario.16As I mentioned, the FOMC carefully monitors a wide array of early indicators of inflation pressure to evaluate this risk.","General","Speech","N/A","61","2018-10"
"2018-10-02","Some have argued that the Fed should be removing policy accommodation much more slowly, pushing the economy to see if the natural rate of unemployment is lower still.","General","Speech","N/A","28","2018-10"

"2018-10-02","Our best estimates, however, suggest that so long as inflation expectations remain anchored, a modest steepening of the Phillips curve would be unlikely to cause a significant rise in inflation or demand a disruptive policy tightening.18Once again, the key is the anchored expectations.","General","Speech","N/A","43","2018-10"
"2018-10-02","Thus, the FOMC takes seriously the possibility that tight markets for labor or other inputs could provide greater upward pressure on inflation than in the baseline outlook.","General","Speech","N/A","27","2018-10"

"2019-10-04","I think we shuffled the cards here. straightforward way. I have to say, the overarching issue that stuck in my mind was the tremendous amount of uncertainty that remains regarding the dynamics that drove this, and that really shapes how I think about the potential actions in moving forward and how we should consider these policies. Let me start with the two options that were offered as the potential strategies. The first: rapid Treasury purchases covered with supplemental term repos, I do believe this offers a pathway for achieving our coming close to the September benchmark. And I have confidence that this can be executed, but, like others, I am concerned about the signal that this could potentially send. It could trigger several lines of thought that could be potentially destabilizing for the economy. As some have noted—as pretty much everyone has noted—it could lead people to think that we are engaging in QE again, because of some concerns that the economy is weaker than the top-line numbers might suggest. And this concern is credible, I think, because the action that we will do will be at the scale comparable to what we did in QE, and it would last for several months. A second possibility is that some could see this as analogous to the financial market breakdowns that preceded the Great Recession, and neither of these would be good, and so the strategy would rely heavily on our communications to make the point that this is not actually what’s driving things. I came into the discussion feeling pretty nervous about this. I think that the discussion today has made me a little more confident that we can accomplish this. I do believe that the speed at which this volatility emerged gives us a real opportunity to say, “Look, I would just say that the second strategy leaves me really concerned, because it relies heavily on the consistent engagement of primary dealers. The memos and the discussion today have made it pretty clear that support from this group is not rock solid, and so a strategy that relies on them gives me some pause. So, given all that, I would “lean toward,” and support, faster-paced Treasury security purchases and moving more dramatically. And I would echo a point that was made by a number of people: Let’s figure out how we get to the desired level as fast as possible. So the approach of Rosengren, Daly, and others to try to front-load this really has some appeal to me. I think the longer this goes, the larger the possibility that there is some confusion or conflicting narratives that emerge. I would share the concern or the question about the focus on a September benchmark as a focal point for a level of reserves that we should move forward. As I was reading the memos, I really question why we would be comfortable there, particularly because the events that triggered the current crisis were modest and were fully predictable. And so the question I ask is, what would happen if something larger happens or if something unpredicted happens? If we’re just at September, I fear that we could be right back in this circus. So, to be safe, I think that there’s some value in having additional buffer above and beyond that September level, and I think this would be prudent. And that comes back to the uncertainty. There is still a lot that we have to learn, and so as we’re learning, I think there would be value in us not trying to be so precise in identifying a level. that an important part of this communication should focus on the real uncertainty that exists in the marketplace, and that we are learning as we go. This is a new space for us, and so this should not be expected to be the last adjustment that we make but rather an evolution toward a deeper understanding of the market and getting us to an optimal policy stance. Thank you, Mr. Chair.","Conference Call","Press Conf","CHAIR POWELL","672","2019-10"
"2019-10-04","Thank you. Look, to my mind, controlling the funds rate and being able to make sure that we don’t have spikes in these money market rates is the highest priority. And also demonstrating that we have that control is very important, as President Rosengren said. Controlling the narrative is in our hands here, and we have an opportunity to do that. This is very consistent with what Vice Chair Williams said. We said we were going to be looking at how market interest rates were going and how reserves were being distributed across the system, and that’s what we’ve been doing. And what we’ve learned is that perhaps we need a higher level of reserves than we thought, and maybe we need higher buffers than we thought, given that events can actually change the desired levels that any one bank will have. I just would point out that the distributional issues mean that there is a lot of uncertainty about what the aggregate level of reserves is going to be needed, and that’s something else that we learned. So I do think that we have to take some actions here even if we’d like banks to be doing it for us, and the actions laid out seem to be appropriate ones. bit higher, because the underrun in April next year suggests that maybe we should get levels up sooner rather than later and higher than what’s suggested in the memos. In terms of communications, I would communicate as soon as we feasibly can. I see no reason to wait. I think this gives us the best chance to separate this from a decision on monetary policy if we do it well ahead of the October meeting. I’m not concerned with engendering a sense of urgency, as the memo pointed out, as one of the reasons to go later. I already think the markets have a sense of urgency here, and going in and addressing it, I think, could actually be calming to the markets and reassuring to the markets. I don’t think it would actually be viewed badly. And it also means we’d be able to control the narrative. In terms of communicating the level—the September level or a dollar level—I would be circumspect, because we don’t really know how much we’re going to be needing to do. So I think the message has got to be, “We’ve noticed the volatility, we want to address it, and this is a plan for addressing it. And we will continue to monitor things and go back in as needed to make sure that we are supplying the level of reserves that’s necessary.” And if I were doing the communications, I would actually do a statement, but I also would put out FAQs, because you can then take all the questions that you think you’re going to be getting and write them out, so that people will be able to understand. Thanks.","Conference Call","Press Conf","MS. MESTER","489","2019-10"
"2019-10-04","Thank you. And thank you for an exceptionally good set of comments from everybody. There is, as always, a healthy diversity, but I think there’s also a consensus that I see in that on some fundamental aspects of a plan. And I’ll come back to that at the end. Let me offer a couple of comments in the meantime. In January, we made a decision to continue what we called an “ample-reserves framework,” and we defined that as meaning that we wouldn’t be going in and out of the market with open market operations with any frequency. And we thought about that for years, and there were risks to making that decision. But we made it, and we explained it clearly, and it was well accepted. I think all of the risk now is to the credibility of that decision. We now need to follow through on that decision robustly, and that’s where the risk is now. It’s not on the other side, as it might have been before we made the decision. So that means, if you think about what the right level of reserves is—I think this is something we need to fine-tune a little bit, but the idea of early September may not be quite right. The idea of current operations, maybe, plus a buffer, as Lael just suggested, something like that. I think the market will need a focal point, and language like “at least,” “a bit above,” “learning as we go,” “uncertainty”—stressing all of those things are healthy. But I do think we need something like that. And, of course, let’s agree that we really don’t know. We really don’t know. you think the equilibrium level is, the volatility around that number is much faster and much bigger than I guess I had intuited. So that means we’re going to be using a lot of language that’s not so much about a level as about the framework and that sort of thing. It’s also worth remembering, there’s a long list of things that can affect—in a downward direction—the demand for reserves, and that includes daylight overdrafts, it includes changes to our Payment System Risk (PSR) policy, it includes internal liquidity stress tests, it includes the issue of Treasuries and reserves and the related issue of having a standing repo facility. Also, the other liabilities—Lorie mentioned this at the beginning, the foreign repo pool and the Treasury General Account (TGA). The TGA we think of as—I mean, it’s so big. We think of it as not part of this—because it’s really the Treasury’s call and all that. But it’s so big and it can move so much. I think it’s worth thinking about whether there aren’t ways to somehow manage its outsized effects on reserves. So there’s a lot that can be going on in the meantime. None of it is going to help us by year-end, or not much of it. So I think the actual answer may be quite different than what we think it is now, which again stresses the need for not being too precise. So why go before the meeting? I think this is a question that we have all been thinking about a lot, and I think the pros and cons were articulated very well by various people. I’ll give you the three reasons for going before the meeting. First, it really creates a separation from the monetary policy decision we make one way or the other at the end of October. Second, as John pointed out, right now we’re right where we need to be with markets. If we don’t do anything for three and a half weeks—25 days or 26 days—I suspect there will be, well before that, a lot of sentiment, like, “Where are they?” So pretty soon we’ll be “behind the curve.” The third thing As both Lael and Neel pointed out, the issue is, doing something off-cycle does draw attention to it. And there, I think, the communication, if you listened to what Thomas said—and this isn’t in what was handed out, but what he said was, “One approach would be to state that you will be conducting outright purchases and term repo operations as necessary to achieve and maintain your desired level of reserves","Conference Call","Press Conf","CHAIR POWELL","710","2019-10"
"2019-10-04","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Like many others, I support the faster plan on Lorie’s chart, graph 7. Like many others, I worry that it’s a little too conservative, and that the cost of being too conservative far outweighs the cost of being more aggressive. And so I would err on the side of being less specific about the level of reserves and erring on the side that we don’t run into some kind of problem at year-end, just so that we do this one and done, and that we bridge ourselves to whatever our long-term solution is. I think that I am the outlier in being less in favor of a midmeeting announcement. I guess my reaction is, that seems highly unusual. I don’t know the last time the Committee put out a formal statement between meetings. I imagine the staff knows. I don’t know the answer to that. That feels like a strategy to maximize attention on this. And if we’re trying to signal that this is a technical procedure, just for monetary policy implementation, in my mind it does the opposite of that. It’s calling maximum attention to it. adjusting the federal funds rate, it would strike me that we could announce this concurrent with our normal FOMC meeting, and this would be more technical in nature, rather than maximizing the spotlight on any notion that we’re doing something profound here. The Committee hasn’t done intermeeting in a very, very long time. Again, obviously, I’m the only person who appears to have that view, so there is the wisdom of crowds. I’ll turn to the ceiling facility. I am in favor of serious consideration of a ceiling facility. I think one thing that I have learned in this is that the discount window is hopelessly stigmatized. I thought that the stigma was because we had a penalty rate, but, boy, markets just blew through the penalty rate and didn’t even look at it. And so I think we do need some type of ceiling facility. But this comes back to, what do we mean by “ample reserves” or “abundant reserves”? If we design the system so that the ceiling facility is never going to be used, it will be stigmatized. So somehow we need to have a very robust conversation about how frequently we expect that ceiling facility to be utilized. And it can’t be never, because then we’re going to be right back where we are right now. We need to accommodate the fact that it will be regularly utilized, so that people do not view that as a sign of weakness. It’s just a sign of regular monetary policy implementation. So we may end up in ample but not abundant reserves—we’ll have to have a robust discussion about that. And then, when we design it, my view would be as wide a range of counterparties as we can get comfortable with, so that we don’t have this disintermediation problem. Thank you, Mr. Chair.","Conference Call","Press Conf","MR. KASHKARI","497","2019-10"
"2019-10-04","Thank you. Governor Brainard. principles. First, our primary goal has to be to maintain good control of the policy rate and effective transmission to other money markets in the financial system. Our secondary goal should be a parsimonious operating framework that accommodates swings in nonreserve liabilities and other changes in supplies and demands without necessitating frequent, large open market operations or risking spikes in the funds rate. And, third, we should aim for simplicity and clarity to the greatest extent possible to separate these technical execution issues from communications about the stance of monetary policy. Those principles led me in November and December of last year to favor ensuring, I think, what is really abundant reserves such that we can be confident that the amount of reserves is more than adequate to meet demand and, thus, provide effective interest rate control. I don’t believe that there are any merits to probing for the lowest level of reserves, particularly in a late- cycle environment when markets are fragile and prone to volatility and misinterpretation. And this is simply repeating, I think, what I said earlier. The process of probing for the kink between the flat and steep part of the demand curve or for the lowest efficient level of reserves is likely to be fraught. It will necessarily entail spikes in federal funds rate volatility. New operations would be needed to contain that volatility, and that is, I think, what we’ve been observing over the past few weeks. So based on that, I do prefer—I guess, would like to see an option 1 prime, perhaps option 1 as amended by Presidents Rosengren, Daly, Evans, Kaplan. I think it’s a long list now. It would be good to see what a more aggressive rebuilding strategy would look like, perhaps going beyond bills to short coupon securities. Maybe there are risks there, so I would like to see proactive and creating a framework rather than being reactive to market developments and relying for a prolonged period on ad hoc operations. So option 2, I think, could be justified, but I do worry that it looks like we will be relying to a greater extent on more reactive, ad hoc operations than an abundant-reserves or an ample-reserves regime would seem to imply. With regard to communications, I think I will make President Kashkari slightly less of an outlier. I had similar kind of instincts when I first saw these options, mostly because I worry that, first of all, there’s not a huge gap between when we would be able to make this decision and when we have our FOMC meeting. But the perception of going out of cycle might put this more in the realm of looking like we’re responding to some kind of financial-stability concerns or that this really is an emergency. And, in fact, this just goes to the core of our execution of monetary policy. I think it’s an opportunity for the FOMC, in regular-cycle communications, to say, “This is what an ample-reserves regime looks like, and that is why we’re building up the level of reserves—to amply satisfy demand.” So, also, just in terms of—it is a difficult communication. I, on balance, would prefer to see the Chair be able to incorporate it into a press conference statement, because that allows us to distinguish between what is an execution decision and a stance-of-policy decision. I do agree with those who have said it does need to be a separate statement. And then, finally, I think I agree with President Bostic. I found the September reference point a little confusing until Governor Clarida explained the connection to previous communications. To me, it would have seemed more natural to say, “We actually have gone out and offered operations, and the level of demand is clearly at the upper end of the range of So let me just conclude by saying “Thank you” to Vice Chair Williams and to the staff across the System. I know this has been a real sprint, and I appreciate all of the work that’s been done. Thank you.","Conference Call","Press Conf","CHAIR POWELL","681","2019-10"
"2019-10-04","in addition, you will continue to offer overnight repo operations to mitigate the risk of money market pressures that could adversely affect the implementation of monetary policy. Specific amounts for the pace of outright purchases and the size and other terms of term and overnight repo operations could then be announced by the Desk and adjusted over time.” So there’s a little bit of a separation of the FOMC decision with the implementation note, and I think that may help break the link to QE. We’re going to have to just “repetitively repeat”—that seems to be the phrase of the day—that it’s not QE, and I think we can make that sale. So waiting has its costs, too. And, I mean, I was on that team until the past couple of days, and now I think I’ve persuaded myself that—but anyway, I think we can manage that. So, in the course of this meeting, I didn’t—of course, we didn’t know how this was going to go, so I actually think there’s a basis to move forward with a plan that we would draw up and then send out to people early next week. We have a scheduled call, another FOMC call, next Friday, which we are happy to do. If people would rather not do that and do it by notation vote, we could do that. I sort of sense it would be better to have the second call. So, after this, I’ll open it up for questions and comments on that. It would be something, too, I think, that I would probably not leave to Q&A in my Tuesday speech. I think I would drop a couple of pages in at the end of the speech, which would load. I think it could foreshadow the decision that we then make on Friday, again, drawing away from the undesirable shock-and-awe factor a little bit, I would hope. The plan would be some pace of asset purchases that covers the consensus of the Committee. There were “slowers,” there were “faster pluses,” but I think we’ll be somewhere in the middle, maybe, with the regular number 7.

"2019-10-04","Thank you, Chair Powell. I’d also like to thank the staff for the work that they have done to help us prepare for the discussion and the many discussions I have had with our staff to better understand the situation. In the short time that I’ve been on the Until last month, we had seen some volatility surrounding these events. But nothing compared with what we saw in September. Since then, we’ve learned a few things. First, I think that we are much closer than I thought to the minimum level of reserves sufficient to maintain control over the federal funds rate. Second, we have learned that repo rates can move significantly in response to the lack of supply and an increased demand for overnight funding, and that this was a surprise to both us and to the markets. And we saw those rates influence other short-term funding markets. To me, this indicates that we need to try to understand and narrow down the potential causes, whether it was the level of the balance sheet, the result of post-crisis regulation as Governor Quarles and Presidents Harker and Bullard have described, or something else entirely. In any case, it appears that we have come close to the lowest comfortable level of reserves, and, therefore, it’s wise to consider increasing the size of our balance sheet before year- end. So today, with the limited information available, if asked to choose among the options that the staff proposed, my preference would be for the second option, which combines the slower pace of Treasury bill purchases with increased overnight and term repo operations. This option seems more straightforward to communicate, and it minimizes the risk that our actions are disruptive to the short-term Treasury securities markets. Further, the smaller monthly purchases may be less likely to be linked with quantitative easing if we can communicate clearly. Beyond these operations, for the longer term, I think we should consider the advanced scheduling of overnight and term repo market operations to be held on three dates or during time frames when we anticipate these markets will face pressures because of quarterly tax filings or the size of our balance sheet. If we find we don’t need them, we could phase them out over time. As many have also discussed, it would also be helpful for us to reconsider what we think the minimum comfortable level of reserves is, incorporating our experiences of the past few weeks into the staff’s ongoing research in this area. I would prefer a level that could be sustained without frequent discussion points or interventions, if possible. I’d also like to see further analysis from the staff on whether these events were partly the result of changes to financial supervision or regulation.

"2019-10-04","banks that this would likely be the case and, therefore, would have made the events in September much less likely had it all been in place by then. But we do not yet have really the rough quantification of the size of this effect, and the details around such a facility would be complex. Much remains to be worked out. So recognizing that we either use effect on the demand for reserves would be even if we do implement these measures, and we have to have a plan to cover the near term. That will likely require, in addition to the current levels of reserves, whether and to what extent these structural rigidities can be addressed. So I now turn to the topic for today—the potential plans for expanding the balance sheet detailed in the staff memo. Principally because I view this as an allocation rather than a level problem, if we were to grow the balance sheet, I’d like to do that in a way most likely not to confuse our actions with a renewal of QE. There are fraught communications issues in resuming balance sheet growth at this point and seemingly under duress. I prefer buying bills in order to have the least effect on the market for duration. My preference would be for smaller interventions. I’d like to keep the amount as close to the organic growth of currency demand as possible, but I do recognize that “as close as possible” may, in fact, be quite a significant addition to reserves in the near term, in order to address this short-term issue. As we think about how all of this will evolve over the longer term, I think we should keep in mind the potential effects of our ability to address these incentives. Thank you, Mr. Chair.","Conference Call","Press Conf","U.S","300","2019-10"
"2019-10-04","All right. Sorry about that. I got cut off for a moment. So I agree with the objectives as stated of returning to a sustainable level of ample reserves, and I think the other objective I would have in assessing these options is erring on the side of preempting volatility in the future versus reacting to it. I think, in that regard, I prefer the faster approach as outlined, the of short coupon securities, if that’s our judgment of what the market could tolerate, I would also be supportive of that. I would not be supportive, though, of going further than that, or I would be buying bonds. In terms of the public’s perception, I don’t personally think that if we’re buying bills and only short coupon securities, I don’t know that the public is going to be able to see much difference between $30 billion and $60 billion a month or even $60 billion and $80 billion a month, and so I would rather back a solution that is more likely to address this issue and preempt future volatility. So I would want to give the staff latitude to do that. Obviously, the communication is going to have to emphasize that this is not QE, that it’s a technical adjustment, but I actually believe we’ll be able to do that. And I like bill purchases and relying more heavily on those, for all the reasons others have said because it’s much more likely to spread reserves through the system. In terms of the announcement, I would strongly favor doing an announcement well before the FOMC meeting, as others have suggested. I think that would de-link it from monetary policy. It’s more consistent with it being a technical adjustment, and it allows us also to start making purchases sooner. I’m glad that Governor Quarles is talking about looking at the regulatory incentives for owning reserves versus Treasury securities, and I think, in the longer run, that would be a good exercise to do. It obviously doesn’t address this situation now. Lastly, as many have said, I think we would be very well served to get this issue off the table. I notice in my own meetings with the public that they are starting to raise broader concerns about liquidity at a time when the economic outlook is more uncertain and we’re more actions, again, that err on the side of preempting future volatility and, if necessary, overdoing this a bit rather than underdoing it.

"2019-10-04","Thank you, Mr. Chair. I’m generally supportive of Desk recommendations on these issues to carry us through the current quarter and over year-end into the first quarter of 2020. But I do think that this has an ad hoc feel to it. And because of that, I think it requires careful management, especially around the quantitative easing issues as just articulated by President Barkin. Like others, I think a standing repo facility would greatly mitigate many of the key issues that we face. There does appear to be a preference in markets for reserves to meet regulatory requirements concerning liquidity, such as the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR), and I agree with President Harker and Governor Quarles on this issue. Governor Clarida also brought this up. I think this is a very important source of distributional issues within this market, and one that could be mitigated greatly by a standing repo facility. Another issue that we face is that we don’t want the federal funds rate trading above the upper end of the range, but repo would remove this. A standing repo facility would fix this. And also, we would meet an international standard. Other central banks operate with a repo facility and a reverse repo facility. So I think we could definitely go in this direction over the medium term, and I know we’ll have an opportunity to discuss this more at our upcoming meeting. One thing about a facility is that reserves could potentially be lower because of expectations effects—that is, knowing that the facility is there, knowing that it’s credible, and development, because it would give the Committee more policy space should we eventually want to return to true quantitative easing at some point in the future in reaction to a particularly negative shock to the","Conference Call","Press Conf","MR.

"2019-10-04","Thank you, Chair Powell. It is customary to thank the staff, but thanks are especially warranted this time. And also, special thanks to Vice Chair Williams, who has led the effort and brought us to a good set of notes and materials for discussing this. So let me just chime in. I’m broadly supportive of the outlines of the effort that have been outlined in the memos that would combine a resumption of bill purchases with the operations as well. I’m also sympathetic—and, indeed, think, for communications purposes, that the artful approach here is useful to us—to put in the language with reference to the September level of reserves but also indicating that we would probably want a cushion above that, but to leave that with a degree of ambiguity to give us the ability to be flexible there. The reason why I like that approach to communications is that we announced in July that we were bringing the process of balance sheet reduction to an end, and we also indicated that we would be learning about the appropriate point and that we would resume purchases. And putting this in September and achieving that level, I think, provides us with a bridge between the July decision and what will be the October decision. I agree with Presidents Daly and Evans and others and, I think, President Harker. I would certainly strongly urge that we do this before the October meeting. I think that would serve a couple of purposes. It would serve the purpose of distinguishing between an ambitious but ultimately a technical action in the functioning of the markets from a policy decision. Literally, there would be time between those two announcements. Also, we’ll have important issues to discuss in October. It would give us more time to do that. So I am very enthusiastic about doing that before the next meeting. In terms of preference for the details, again, the broad plan, I think, is a good one. I would have a preference for something similar to option 8 on exhibit 2, but with the addition— that I think both Presidents Rosengren and Daly mentioned—that, instead of having a constant amount of purchases over the window, would think of some months where there would be some bunching of purchases at very high levels. My preference would be to put that in December, through outright purchases. Again, I think we’d need to keep the term repos in place, but as opposed to, say, doing $60 billion a month continuously, do a somewhat smaller—perhaps much smaller—number in most months and then really loading in big purchases if that were technically possible. Let me conclude with a couple of longer-term thoughts. Again, I know our interest is the near term, but I do think I’d like to provide some context on some points that Governor Quarles mentioned. I do think we’re going to end up, at some point, with a standing repo facility. I think that can be potentially helpful in a lot of dimensions that we’ve discussed. I know that’s not on the table today, but certainly my own view is that it’s going to have to be an element of a longer- term solution. One thing that I did pick up in my conversations that we had with the Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee (TBAC) crowd when they were at the Board last week is that it will be important to get the details and the way we communicate a standing repo facility, right? If we really want this to be a facility that we use as a substitute for having high reserve levels, then they need to know that they are able to use it in size. We’d have to think about the pricing, we’d have to think about the spread and all of that. But, again, I think that’s where we’re going to end up, and I think that’s an important part of the longer-term resolution here. Let me perhaps offer a cautionary note on the issue of the funds rate versus the repo market. Clearly, the repo market is much more important than the funds market now, and the funds market is a different funds market than it was before the crisis. But that being said, I would urge that we give a longer-term and really serious discussion over time to moving primary reason is that the repo market is much larger. I had my staff print a chart of the daily spread between general collateral (GC) repo, and the funds rate going back 45 years. That spread moves around all the time. You can have a well-functioning, growing, healthy economy in the ’90s with the repo and the funds rate spread moving around. And there are some reasons why that spread moves around. The art to doing this is we don’t want a replay. The move in this spread on September 17 was the largest spread in the history of the data set going back 45 years times 250 days a year. So, yes, you don’t want those moves. But on the other hand, I would be nervous about publicly committing us to the repo rate being plus or minus 1 basis point. So we would have to be careful if we moved down that road. I’m not saying we are moving down that road, but that would be a consideration. And then, finally, and I’ll close on this, the staff has offered some good ideas about bridging between now and April on what we call the temporary open market operations. At least one thing I’d put on the table is perhaps keying the decision to do those operations to where the funds rate itself trades. So, for example, on a day when the funds rate is within 1 or 2 or whatever basis points of the top of the range, we might announce an operation. And then that would make it clear that, at least now, this is about controlling the funds rate. This is about keeping the funds rate in the range. And, again, there may be problems with that, but it’s at least something to think about down the road when we’re talking about the detailed design of the temporary operations. But, again, I do think this is going to be a necessary step. I like the idea of bridging between the July decision and what we would be announcing, and I very much like the idea of doing it before our October 30 meeting.

"2019-10-04","Thank you, Mr. Chair. I want to thank New York and the Board for all the hard work. This is an area in which helping educate us all on the details of money markets and how they behave and new development here is really important. So I appreciate all of that. channel of our monetary policy transmission mechanism is directly through credit intermediation that supports our growth and inflation mandates. The Committee’s recent actions to cut rates have worked to recalibrate our policy setting to a more accommodative setting of the federal funds rate. Unexpected financial volatility in money markets that’s symptomatic of weaker, poor market functioning increases the cost of credit intermediation. Unintended additional volatility may frustrate our recent policy actions. So making adjustments to our programs here—that’s not monetary policy, but it is important for monetary policy. This is likely to be a challenging issue, as our preference for pointing to the setting of administered rates, like the IOER rate and the ON RRP rate, will likely be less powerful alone. That is, as the IOER rate is reduced further within the funds rate target range, the market’s determination of the federal funds rate is becoming less about arbitraging administered spreads to the IOER and ON RRP rates, and it’s more about arbitraging spreads to money market rates, which we don’t control directly. And I think the size of reserves in the system probably influences which arbitrage is going to be most prevalent. So that’s why that’s going to be important for us. This tells me that our earlier, better experience when we had a clearly ample quantity of reserves was important. We haven’t defined “ample” precisely—but the recent market disruptions are clear evidence that reserves have fallen below “ample.” So the question now is, what’s the best way to get back to an appropriate level? And I think Governor Brainard’s question about—we’re talking about organic growth a lot. What do we really mean by that? I agree with Lorie’s response that there are trend factors that we’re other nonreserve liabilities are evolving. So there’s going to be a lot going on, and we shouldn’t be surprised if we have to revisit moments like this. I doubt that organic growth is going to be the easy type of in-the-background assessment that we would all like. Second, we obviously need to implement a near-term fix in order to keep money markets best aligned with our policy setting. But we also need a longer-term plan for how we will maintain an ample-reserves regime over time. It seems clear to me that such a plan will include Treasury security purchases. Near-term issues aside, over the longer term, we will need to grow our balance sheet to keep up with organic growth in currency and other nonreserve liabilities. We will do this by buying Treasury securities, just as we always have. So we should coalesce around a long-term implementation plan that includes regular asset purchases. It makes sense to rely on Treasury bill purchases now as much as possible to address the immediate problem of our current reserves shortfall. As I understand our risks and policy objectives, I favor emphasizing bill purchases to add the majority, or lion’s share, of the new reserves and using a combination of daily and term repos to fill in the market-functioning details. So I think that the $60 billion per month T-bills proposal is better than the $30 billion per month proposal. I agree with the Daly–Rosengren proposal so far, about making a one-time program of additional purchases of some size to close the gap sooner would be helpful. Now, I recognize that some have worried that outright bill purchases may be misconstrued as a new round of quantitative easing. I think that’s a communications issue that can be dealt with quite adequately by the Chair and supporting commentary coming from all of us and also publication of the implementation details. Basically, with quantitative easing, hands of the private sector. It’s really all about duration, I would say, for anybody who’s paying attention to what the actual thrust is of QE purchases we’re supposed to be doing. Short-term bill purchases will not add to duration meaningfully, and this just really becomes a communications task. Third, there’s undoubtedly much to learn about financial stability from the past few weeks, and we’ve already heard commentary by President Harker and Governor Quarles about the implications of regulatory policy—supervisory interpretation of things that are interesting and we should digest better. One lesson that’s been driven home for me is the value of ample reserves and facilitating the intermediation process and in preventing an amplification of market volatility. The ample-reserves regime has proven its ability to prevent small shocks from turning into big problems. One conclusion I drew from the memo is that there’s a good chance that the early September tax payments and Treasury security issuance would not have even shown up on our radar screens if reserves had been higher—say, at the level of just a few months ago. Indeed, an implementation regime that can handle these kinds of shocks seems to be exactly what the Federal Reserve Act had in mind when it told us to furnish an elastic currency. I’m uncomfortable with communicating a message that our balance sheet goal is merely reserves at the level of early September. We need to make sure that we’ve got a large margin for error, and that’s why I asked about other assessments of what those numbers might be. Some of those numbers were larger, and some were smaller. So we need a larger margin for error. I don’t know what that number should be. I’d err on the side of making sure we had plenty. The It’s certainly the case that regulatory adjustments for some of the largest banks that are worried about the Liquidity Coverage Ratio and the supervisory implications could be an important aspect to that. But I go back to what we were thinking about when we said, “We want an ample balance sheet, and we’re focused on efficiency.” Efficiency always sounds like an excellent idea. and I’m an economist, so I certainly subscribe to—we like efficient outcomes. But in this context, it always struck me that efficiency was more about “optics” and people criticizing the Federal Reserve for having a profligate size of the balance sheet. We’ve already sort of incurred some costs for wanting a somewhat lower-sized balance sheet, and if we go the route of just adjusting regulatory policy somewhat, hoping that that will help us, I think that that’s got quite a lot of risk. I would describe that as a risky strategy, myself. Lastly, I agree with the suggestions that we should communicate earlier. I asked about the NABE speech. I would be completely comfortable with the Chair taking the lead early on describing all of the issues that are in front of us and providing some indication of what the Committee action is likely to be. Bolder is safer, I think, for our monetary policy and the objectives that we have. Thank you, Mr. Chair.","Conference Call","Press Conf","MR. EVANS","1185","2019-10"
"2019-10-04","I’m sorry—I thought I was in the order last. I’m ready to go, though. I’m supportive of announcing in advance of our next scheduled meeting, frankly, that we intend to rebuild and maintain reserves at or moderately above levels prevailing earlier this year. This would provide assurance to market participants—and to the public more generally, to the Like Vice Chair Williams, I would like to remain flexible and focus on our goals of interest rate control and providing ample reserves in order to execute on that. I worry if we provide too much detail—although Thomas and Lorie convinced me of September having some benefits, too much detail, I think, could signal too much confidence in the quantity when we’re actually not sure about that. We have a lot of uncertainty, and we’re going to continue to learn. What we’re really sure about is that we want the funds rate to trade within the range, and the rest of it is something we’re going to learn about. So I lean toward fewer details—as few as would reasonable—and more framework and commitment. Now, in terms of the two options presented in the staff memo, I’m in favor of using purchases of Treasury bills as the primary tool for ensuring an ample supply of reserves. I tend to favor the approach of a faster pace of bill purchases. Indeed, much like President Rosengren, I would like to even consider an alternative strategy that front-loads these purchases, taking the opportunity of making a technical adjustment because there’s so much emphasis right now on the disruptions in the repo market and perhaps make some immediate larger purchases to the extent that the market can withstand it in order to get us back up to a level that’s more comfortable. We could then allow the balance sheet to grow more organically as we learn about the desired level of reserves and whether to use a standing repo facility. And here I support the idea that has been discussed by many that the standing repo facility, even if we have it, should be something we occasionally use. My understanding of an ample-reserves regime is we rarely need to go to that—only for payment shocks. Desk announcement. Like Thomas indicated, this seems like a sizable decision—and one that we should take ownership of. Importantly, I think we can take control of the narrative. Right now, the narrative is being written for us. And it’s often not very positive, as President Rosengren mentioned. The opportunity for us to go in and say, “This is not QE, this is really the plumbing, this is a technical adjustment. We’re committed to having the funds rate trade within the range we’ve stated”—I think those are things that, if we have unified talking points, we can absolutely accomplish. I’m not just optimistic. I’ve actually been in situations like many of you—more than I’d like to be, really—of being asked these questions by my board of directors, by outside participants, many of whom are involved in markets. And when you go through the details and explain the framework and explain what we’re doing, then they get it. And I think this is enhanced by being at the short end, using bills and not longer-duration purchases. That really kind of tells them that this is not QE, it’s really technical adjustments. So I believe that we can do this. I would like to see us do it earlier, so that we don’t confuse distinct things. It’s just another opportunity not to confuse the stance of monetary policy with the plumbing or the execution of policy. So with that I would say, thank you, Mr. Chair.","Conference Call","Press Conf","MS. DALY","610","2019-10"
"2019-10-04","Thank you, Mr. Chair. So I’ll join what I’m sure will be a tsunami of thanks to the staff for the quick and clear analysis of recent repo market developments. I know how much work that has been and, particularly, the time constraints that it has been done under. So much more is clear than was clear two weeks ago, although there is still a bunch that remains unclear. But my current view is that the recent spike in rates is primarily indicative, as President Harker was suggesting, of structural features in our regulatory framework that have introduced rigidities into the system’s ability to allocate reserves across institutions. In the absence of those regulatory and supervisory incentives and disincentives, which we have introduced into the system, my current hypothesis on the basis of what we’re hearing is that the current overall level of reserves would be abundant—should be more than abundant, or ample, or whatever the correct word is—and I view the problem as one of allocation rather than scarcity. Now, directing those incentives would be a midterm project, and we have a short-term problem. And today’s discussion is to focus on handling the short-term issue. I don’t want to distract us from that. On top of that, the regulatory and supervisory issues that I think are in question are matters for the Board rather than the Committee. That’s why I mention that point whenever raising regulatory issues in an FOMC meeting. But I do think that my particular contribution to this discussion is at least to lay out how I see those issues having contributed to So what’s the source of the allocation problem? Banks have told us—and the largest banks have particularly emphasized this—that they feel under supervisory pressure for reserves over short-term Treasury securities in satisfying their liquidity requirements in a post-crisis framework. Now, as most of you know, they cited other regulatory incentives as well that are related to the leverage ratio and the calculation of the G-SIB surcharge. I think these latter two are much less likely to have been particularly relevant to the events of September, but I do think that the unwillingness of the large banks to part with reserves at any price in September is showing us that we need to address those incentives that are biasing some banks to hold reserves over Treasury securities. And, again, just to review for everyone, the consequences of the current liquidity measures come from two principal elements: the Liquidity Coverage Ratio and the internal liquidity stress tests that we require banks to run. The Liquidity Coverage Ratio— again, as almost all of you know but maybe not all of you have at the top of your head— establishes a minimum that firms have to comply with. It’s based on standardized definitions and outflow rates. And under the Liquidity Coverage Ratio, the actual regulation—there’s no difference between reserves and Treasury securities. It is indifferent. The stress tests are not, necessarily. In 2018, for example, our supervisors conducted an internal liquidity stress-test buffer monetization exam, looking at how the firms were assigning appropriate monetization haircuts to highly liquid securities in the event of stress. And there are differences in the speed and ease of monetization of Treasury securities and reserves, and that will show up in the banks’ internal liquidity stress test. fair bit of time since mid-September on the phone with my counterparts at the Bank of England and ECB, who were quite direct about that. And, interestingly, the ECB, for example, has a much lower level of long-term demand for reserves, as I’ve mentioned in the Committee before—close to $400 billion relative to what, in our case, had been, at one point, $2 trillion and now $1.45 trillion or higher. Now, a standing repo facility would be important in conjunction with this, and I’m looking forward to our discussion at the October meeting. Part of the concern with these internal liquidity stress tests is that there is a difference between the monetizability of reserves and Treasury securities and stress—it’s not huge, but it is there. And a standing repo facility—or at least the Platonic ideal of such a facility—would dramatically reduce or eliminate such a difference and, therefore, reduce or eliminate the different treatment of reserves and Treasury securities in banks’ liquidity stress tests. The ECB, for example, has a facility through which the central bank monetizes nonreserve high-quality liquid assets, and this is likely to be a factor in their much lower long-term level of reserves demand—although negative interest rates are also a strong contributor, obviously. So such a facility would be helpful in handling periods of stress, but it would also likely lower the overall demand for reserves by guaranteeing the convertibility of Treasury securities.

"2019-10-04","I am. There you go. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Maybe it was better when I was on mute. [Laughter] Although I share the immediate concerns for our money markets, I would like to briefly start by posing two fundamental questions that go beyond the recent developments. First, I think we need to ask ourselves if the existing regulations or supervision explicitly or implicitly favor reserves over other high-quality liquid assets and are interfering with market functioning. The second question is whether the federal funds rate remains the best choice for our policy target, given that the unsecured lending market is decidedly thin compared to the repo market. Now, these questions are not on the agenda today, but I believe we should revisit them and other fundamental issues in the near future. Regarding the pressing operational matters, I believe we should take action as soon as possible to keep the level of reserves somewhat north of $1.4 trillion through the end of the year. I suspect that a lower level of reserves could still be compatible with an ample-reserves regime. All that said, there is little to gain by letting reserves decline further at this point and much more to lose if we struggle with interest rate control. With regard to the questions of how to stabilize reserves, I have a preference toward outright purchases of Treasury bills in the faster- purchases scenario, effectively restarting the organic growth of the balance sheet. To avoid impairing markets, the right mix should also include term repo operations as well as overnight repo operations as a backstop for rate control. So, like many things in life, “Timing is everything,” as they say. Let me turn to the question of whether to announce our actions before the October FOMC meeting. I actually see both pros and cons to this. In light of the large shortfall of reserves projected by year-end in the absence of actions, an early start to purchases would be helpful and allow a smoother and slower pace. Yet moving early may surprise markets—which could, in turn, lead market participants to believe that there are broader concerns about financial stability or liquidity. For me, the tiebreaker is the ever-present risk that our actions may be misperceived as a change in our policy stance. The silver lining—if there is a silver lining in the September episode—is that this has actually made our communications, in my mind, a bit easier, giving us a real-life illustration of the kind of episode that we aim to avoid by restarting the organic growth of the balance sheet. That said, we cannot be too cautious. A decision today and an announcement shortly thereafter would put further distance between implementation decisions and the stance of monetary policy, particularly because we cannot discount the possibility of a rate cut in October. Thus, I favor taking immediate action. policy stance. So I’d like to save our occasional disagreements for monetary policy but strive in this case to try to send a unified message.

I think that’s the best short-term solution to getting our level of reserves back up. I also believe, over the longer term, we should clarify what’s happening with some of these structural issues. I think the fact that a liquidity regulation was aimed to enhance market functioning—an important role of intermediation during times of stress—means something isn’t calibrated right there. So I’m glad Governor Quarles has raised that issue as something that needs to be addressed. And then, finally, with our communication, I would announce quickly and act quickly to affirm our operational framework for ample reserves and our objectives of rate control.

You know, this is a coin flipper. It’s a very close call. Anyway, that’s what I worry about. Also, I think, after I speak—and John will speak, too, I guess—they’ll know it’s coming, and they may be speculating that it might be coming sooner, and then it should reduce the drama of the thing if it’s already been heavily foreshadowed. Any other comments or questions? [No response] So everybody is good with this? President Bullard. and separating it more from the FOMC meeting is probably a good idea. I don’t know if we could get a midweek vote or something.

How to explain these things as, in some sense, making up for a certain level.

"2019-10-04","Thank you. President Rosengren. would have expected from relatively routine shocks, and I have been surprised by the reputational effects, which are also much greater than I thought, in two dimensions. One is, as Vice Chair Williams just highlighted, the repo market is now the subject of regular news articles. It’s not good if I know my plumber’s phone number without looking it up on a phone. [Laughter] And it’s probably not good if financial plumbing becomes the questions of nonfinancial reporters. And so my own experience has been that, at every talk and in every briefing with a reporter, these questions are coming up. There is much broader interest in something that we probably ideally should be doing in the background. The second concern I have on the reputational effects is, there are a lot of misleading articles, frequently by people who don’t quite understand what’s happening in the money markets. But they’re making associations to the financial crisis or to other kinds of disruptive economic concerns, and I think that’s really problematic at a time when there’s a fair amount of uncertainty about the outlook. So those reputational concerns are something that I think we ought to think about, in terms of both the urgency and speed with which we address what’s been happening in the money markets. My own preference would be to have an abundant-reserves regime rather than an ample- reserves regime. I know I have lost this debate, but I think we’ve learned the costs are actually larger than I might have thought, and I think this is the appropriate time to think that maybe there’s little cause for taking out more insurance against the volatility we’ve recently seen. And given that these reputational risks seem a little bit greater, I’d prefer not to be so close to the upward-sloping part of the demand for reserves. options, that would be my preferred option. However, my preference would be to be bolder. As the memo highlighted, there are going to be more downdrafts and reserves next year. I’d prefer to announce a technical adjustment relatively soon—involving a larger expansion of our balance sheet, possibly including notes and bonds, in light of some of the Q&A that just occurred, in addition to more quickly increasing the bill purchases. This would more quickly get away from the need for term repurchase agreements and have us better situated for lower reserve balances next year.

"2019-10-04","I think it’s important to look back over the course of the year as the level of reserves has been declining. We have seen banks with surplus reserves lending those into the repo market. So some of the changes that we’ve been seeing and the correlation between movements and repo and unsecured have been because banks have been lending more or less of some of that surplus into the repo market based on price movements. There is some distribution that’s taking place. That distribution tends to take place more in the repo market, as Patricia discussed, and less in the interbank unsecured market than it did pre-crisis because of the regulatory frictions associated with the cost of balance sheet for those two types of transactions. That said, not all banks lend in repo, and so I think if we were going to see an enhancement in that distributional process, some banks that don’t currently do that type of transaction would have to begin to do that, and that’s not part of their business model today. That’s particularly true for some of the large domestic banks outside the SIFIs and also with regional banks as well. And it’s unclear what type of price that would require for them to change that business activity and over what length of time.","Conference Call","Press Conf","MS. LOGAN","218","2019-10"
"2019-10-04","As we discussed in the memo, the focus that we took was to return reserve levels to early September, but also to combine that with the use of overnight RPs as a backstop. And we think that combination over these next three months will reduce volatility in money markets. And, more importantly, it will provide time for the Committee, I think, to make longer- term assessments—like the ones you’re raising, President Evans—about what the appropriate efficient and effective level of reserves is. I think, importantly, over that time, we can go back to some of those historical experiences and do more analysis about the type of relationships that Patricia was talking about. And we can think more deeply about the shape of the aggregate reserves demand curve and the type of distributional frictions that we saw. And it also gives the Committee time to think about some longer-run strategies about a standing repo facility or changes in other nonreserve liabilities or overall incentives to affect the demand for reserves. So our focus, really, here in the memo was on the next three months. And in the context of the next three months, I think that returning to that level is what is feasible in combination with the overnight RP and will give the Committee time to discuss these issues in more detail.","Conference Call","Press Conf","MS. LOGAN","222","2019-10"
"2019-10-04","Okay, all right. If I could ask a second question—the communications memo points to us talking about early September levels of reserves—the documents are prepared. So I guess my question is, early September size of reserve balances—that’s a focal point. I’m trying to be careful here. I’m not asking anybody for what they think of as the optimal size of reserves or anything, but it seemed to be a focal point from a time when things were working a little bit better. In preparation, I went back and thought a little bit about some other levels of reserves that have been mentioned. So back in December 2018, at the FOMC meeting, there was a presentation. And it was just mentioned that the level of reserves at that time, if we had sort of stopped reducing the runoff, would have been $1.74 trillion, and we shouldn’t have any difficulties with how money markets are functioning. That’s well north of where we are, so I guess that’s not so surprising. The early September number is about $1.45 trillion. But in March 2019, we had a presentation in which we talked about the Senior Financial Officer Survey estimates of comfortable levels of reserves and aggregated those—a little under $900 billion, I thought, was what they were pointing to. There were uncertainties associated with those estimated, a couple of buffers were added on top of that, and I think we got to what was supposed to be a pretty comfortable level of reserves—$1.1 trillion—or maybe it was $1.2 trillion, but it’s pretty far south from where we are. And that was our best thinking at the time. This is evolving, we’re learning about the markets, and so, you know, there’s good reason to think that that was a good market functioning should be pretty good if we were going to go that route. I’m just trying to figure out these other kinds of levels.","Conference Call","Press Conf","MR. EVANS","320","2019-10"
"2019-10-04","Thank you, Thomas. I think that all sounds right. I think the only thing that we would add is that, over the course of this year, we have seen a relationship emerging, as you noted, between changes in the reserves supply and changes in the federal funds rate. And so, at higher reserve levels, maybe last March, we saw a lower degree of that relationship—and rates that were more centered and more stable above the IOER rate. And there was less dispersion in the federal funds and Eurodollar markets than we saw over the course of the summer and, most certainly, more recently. I think we saw a little bit of that relationship emerging, and then, most","Conference Call","Press Conf","MS. ZOBEL","117","2019-10"
"2019-10-04","Thank you, Mr. Chair. I have a couple of questions. I guess the first one starts from the options for communications, the second bullet, which highlights that we can “highlight continuity with our January 2019 decision to maintain an ample supply of reserves so that control over the federal funds rate and other short-term interest rates is exercised primarily through the setting of administered rates.” That got my attention, because I know that we have talked about administered rates being the focal point for how we establish the federal funds rate within our target range. But, you know, it seems that’s highly dependent on the level of reserves that we have, because as we have had to move the interest rate on excess reserves (IOER) lower into the target range, the funds rate is trading above that, and the IOER rate and the overnight reverse repurchase (ON RRP) rate are lower than that. And it seems that it’s more money market arbitrage that is determining the funds rate. If we really wanted—so I’m a little concerned about highlighting administered rates there. That’s one part of the question. But the other one would be, it seems quite related to the size of reserves. If we had greater levels of reserves so that it is the arbitrage for the administered rates, then it could be consistent with this point. Is there some relationship between the level of reserves and the emphasis on administered rates? I mean, that’s a combination of questions maybe for Thomas and the Desk. that the federal funds rate is trading reliably within the target range. I don’t necessarily see a strict relationship there between the level of the federal funds rate and the level of the administered rates. So if you have a mechanism by which you set the administered rates and the federal funds rate—for example, trades above the administered rates—but you have firm control of the federal funds rate within the target range, that would seem to me to be one version that is consistent with what you expressed, because, basically, it is, as you move the administered rates, the federal funds rate is really closely tied to them. In contrast—right?—if you had, for example, a situation in which you have signs of reserve scarcity, then you have high-frequency fluctuations in factors affecting reserve supply, like the things we have seen with tax dates, et cetera. And then what you might see is that, actually, the link between your administered rates and the federal funds rate becomes a lot more volatile. And so that might be the situation that I would interpret your statement as indicating you wanted to avoid. Lorie or Patricia, I don’t know if you have thoughts.","Conference Call","Press Conf","MR. EVANS","454","2019-10"
"2019-10-04","Yes. I may be wrong, but I think Governor Quarles also asked you about the temporary versus the standing repo facility and how to think about that, and I thought that was an important question. Lorie, I don’t know if you want to come back in on that. October on the idea of a standing repo facility. First, I think we have learned that the repo operations generally are effective. They have brought down rates, and they have calmed markets through the use of a repo-type operation. This wasn’t a standing facility but had some similar features that, I think, would be effective. We have also learned, though, that there is not perfect pass-through from the type of counterparties that we have. Currently, we rely on primary dealers involved in that, those repo operations. And as we discussed in answer to the question from Governor Quarles, those dealer balance sheets are not fully elastic, and so the pass-through and intermediation is not very smooth. There are some frictions there. For example, the dealers that are coming into our operations and then on-lending are charging quite a bit of a spread to those who don’t have access to the operations. The other thing I think we have learned through this process—not specific to the open market operations, but to the money market conditions more broadly—is that we did see that 15 banks did borrow in federal funds or unsecured markets at rates above the discount rate. So, you know, there is stigma associated with the discount window that we can evidently see. And I think it would be important, when designing a standing repo facility, to consider what type of restrictions or communications surround it, so that that type of stigma wouldn’t also apply to this facility. So I think issues regarding the counterparties that would be appropriate for a permanent standing repo facility would be an important discussion in October—the appropriate rates as well","Conference Call","Press Conf","MS. BRAINARD","324","2019-10"
"2019-10-04","Yes. The only question is for Lorie, and I think I know your view on this—I assume you would assert that the “faster” approach versus the “slower” approach gives you greater confidence that we would meet the objective of returning to the early September reserves target and put us in the best position to deal with year-end demands, that the faster approach would give you more confidence we’ll achieve those objectives than the slower approach?","Conference Call","Press Conf","MR. KAPLAN","75","2019-10"
"2019-10-04","Okay, thank you. So, in terms of the temporary repo market operations, I think you raised two important points. One of the limitations of the temporary open market operations that we discussed is related to the balance sheet constraints that you were talking on to other market participants—that does gross up their balance sheet. And particularly as we’re moving into your end, we’ve heard from them already that they would be unlikely to do that sort of intermediation that they started to do in these early days of September. Now, they would do some of it, but probably not to the degree that they have been doing it. So we do see this intermediation and balance sheet constraint as a key limitation of the temporary open market operations. I think the second point you raised about the commitment—you know, I do think that market participants have a view that purchases are more in line with the ample-reserves regime in terms of the permanent base of reserves that would be maintained. But that’s not a theme that we’ve been hearing a lot about right now, for the short term. I would say the other consideration and limitation of using temporary open market operations, as opposed to purchases, is that, as you can see in the forecast, sometimes the increase in nonreserve liabilities and, therefore, the drop in reserves can be quite large and very swift. And if you use permanent purchases to get ahead of that so that there’s a buffer, then we’re more likely to be able to maintain that minimum level of reserves. If you rely just on the temporary open market operations to fill that gap in those periods that you can see in gray, one, we might not have the capacity, and, two, it’s a very sudden shift in the Federal Reserve’s operations with the private sector to try to fill that large of a hole in that short amount of time. So, I would say, there are three types of constraints we’re talking about with the temporary open market operations: one, the balance sheet limitations; two, the commitment to the ample-reserves regime, though I don’t think that’s been in play in the short run; and then,","Conference Call","Press Conf","MS. LOGAN","370","2019-10"
"2019-10-04","Yes. Just one question, with respect to clarification. So I think I understood from the briefing that a significant problem in continuing with ad hoc operations until we could make, perhaps, more permanent changes that may be affecting incentives for the market but as a way of addressing the current shortfall, I think I understood that that had to do with the capacity of the balance sheets of the counterparties as to why we thought those ad hoc operations might be—that that might be an unsustainable way to proceed. So am I correct about that as to that being a problem, or are there problems, as well as the length of time we might be doing that, that could be perceived as undermining our commitment to an ample-reserves regime? And then I have a question—that is, if the former is the case, one of the things that has been thought about for the longer term—and although we’re talking about the shorter term today, I just wanted to make sure that I understand this as well, because it does affect a little bit how I think what we ought to do in the shorter term. For the longer term, is that an element of—a longer-term response could be the implementation of a kind of a standing repo facility, which I had understood would be kind of an Eddie Murphy–Dan Aykroyd in Trading Places—you know, “Bring ’em on. We’ll take them all.” And is that the case? And if that’s the case as to what the repo facility would be, how does it work that’s different from these ad hoc operations, which might be limited by the capacity of the counterparties? That’s it.","Conference Call","Press Conf","MR. QUARLES","281","2019-10"
"2019-10-04","2 Thank you, Lorie. I will be referring to the handout “Material for the Briefing on Communications Considerations regarding Plans for Open Market Operations.” If the Committee were to agree on a plan for the growth of its Treasury securities holdings as well as repo operations over the rest of this year and into next, it may wish to issue a statement to communicate this decision to the public. Depending on the timing of your decision, you could issue this statement following your regularly scheduled October meeting or well before then. Even in the former case, you may want to issue this statement separately from your regular postmeeting statement to emphasize that these balance sheet decisions are distinct from the choice of the policy stance. Regarding the timing of this statement, as Lorie highlighted, announcing your decisions before the October meeting would provide more time for Treasury security 2 The materials used by Mr. Laubach are appended to this transcript (appendix 2). May 2010, and as of earlier this week most market participants didn’t seem to expect an announcement about reserve maintenance purchases before October 30. Turning to the possible content of such a statement: You could highlight the continuity and consistency of your decision with previous communications by referring to your January 2019 decision that you intend to maintain an ample supply of reserves so that control over the federal funds rate and other short-term interest rates is exercised primarily through the setting of administered rates. One important consideration in formulating such a statement is how you would describe the level of reserves you wish to maintain over time. The options that Lorie presented are predicated on the view that, in light of the experience of recent weeks, it is prudent to maintain a level of reserves at or moderately above those prevailing in early September, before the sharp decline around the middle of the month. Communicating this intention would provide assurance to market participants that your operations will be sufficiently large to prevent reserves from running much below $1.5 trillion. Another consideration is how specific to be about the mix and size of outright purchases and of term and overnight repo operations. One approach would be to state that you will be conducting outright purchases and term repo operations as necessary to achieve and maintain your desired level of reserves, and that, in addition, you will continue to offer overnight repo operations to lower the risk of money market pressures that could adversely affect the implementation of monetary policy. Specific amounts for the pace of outright purchases and the size and other terms of term and overnight repo operations could then be announced by the Desk and adjusted over time if needed. More generally, in light of the uncertainty surrounding the level of reserves most consistent with efficient and effective implementation, it might well be prudent to emphasize that you will continue to monitor money market developments as you assess what that level is, and that you stand ready to adjust the details of these plans as necessary. Thank you, Mr. Chair. That completes our prepared remarks, and we’ll be happy to answer questions.","Conference Call","Press Conf","MR. LAUBACH","526","2019-10"
"2019-10-04","Thank you, Patricia. I’ll be referring to exhibit 2. As Patricia noted, recent developments suggest that it’s appropriate to consider next steps in the transition process to the most efficient and effective level of reserves. In the near term, one step the Committee could consider is directing the Desk to maintain reserve levels similar to the average level in early September. This would entail operations to maintain the reserves created through recent operations and offset future growth of nonreserve liabilities. Second, the Desk could execute overnight repo operations each day through year-end to provide a shock absorber to support control of the federal funds rate in addition to maintaining reserves similar to the early September average. These two steps could provide more assurance of rate control as the Committee considers longer-run strategies to maintain an ample-reserves regime, which might include considerations relevant to reducing reserve demand or the establishment of a standing repo facility. My briefing today centers on how to reduce the risk of volatility in funding markets over the near term while providing time for the Committee to consider these longer-term issues. If the Committee wishes to maintain reserve levels close to, or moderately above, those that prevailed in early September, a fairly sizable amount of open market operations would be required. The actions taken by the Desk to address pressures in money markets over the second half of September lifted reserve levels by around $100 billion on average during the latter half of the month to just above $1.4 trillion. Absent further open market operations, reserves will decline significantly over coming months. The staff estimate that the SOMA would likely need to increase by at least $250 billion by the end of 2019 and by more than $350 billion to maintain a similar level of reserves through April of next year. Our current forecast of reserves is shown in grey in panel 7. In the memo, two illustrative scenarios using both Treasury bill purchases and term repos are presented to maintain reserve levels around $1.45 trillion, the average relate to communications and the capacity of the market to smoothly absorb these operations. In the first scenario shown in panel 7, Treasury securities are purchased in the secondary market at a faster pace. This quicker pace of purchases means there is somewhat less reliance on repo operations to add reserves, which might improve the intermediation of reserves by relying less on primary dealers that may face balance constraints to do repo, particularly around year-end. The advantage of relying more heavily on outright purchases is that the Treasury market is deep and liquid, and can absorb a fairly high volume of transactions. Outright purchases also lay a permanent base of reserves, which can reduce the size of operations needed to maintain reserve levels in the future. In panel 7, we assumed purchases of Treasury bills of around $60 billion per month, which could make a significant contribution toward filling the reserve need by year-end. We will learn more about the capacity of the Treasury market to absorb our operations through experience and could find that we are comfortably able to purchase more than this amount or possibly somewhat less. I should note that the addition of a broader “universe” of Treasury securities, such as those notes and bonds having only a few years to maturity, would likely add to the capacity. Now, Treasury security purchases do have some drawbacks. Large purchases of Treasury securities might have some chance of being conflated with quantitative easing, particularly by a broader audience that is less familiar with the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet. Purchasing Treasury bills may reduce this association, because they are money market instruments with limited duration and doing so would not materially change the quantity of duration in the private sector’s hands or the total term premium effect of the SOMA portfolio, all else being equal. However, to the broader public, this distinction might not be apparent. The second scenario, shown in panel 8, relies more heavily on repo market operations to achieve the desired level of reserves. Repo operations have been successful at restoring calm in money markets in recent weeks, as Patricia discussed. As such, repo would be an important component of any plan. However, there are important limitations of repo operations, particularly around year-end. Operating in the repo market depends heavily on primary dealer balance sheet capacity and willingness to intermediate to the broader market. As dealers manage their balance sheets closely into year-end, they may have less capacity to take up large amounts of term repo and lend this onward because of these constraints. As shown in panel 8, a greater reliance on term operations may make it somewhat more difficult to achieve the reserve level objective. In this scenario, we use the September quarter-end experience as a guide to how much term repo can be sustained. Overnight repo operations could supplement these term operations, of course, but as a backstop to rates. We cannot estimate with assurance how much overnight take-up we might see, so they’re not shown in the panel. the communications, and then purchase higher levels of securities heading into year- end. Higher levels of purchases in December may be more easily explained as associated with the year-end downdraft in reserves and balance sheet constraints. In any approach, it may take some time to maintain reserves near or above the levels that prevailed in early September. Faster purchases or higher repo take-up could help achieve the objective sooner, but it may still take some time. As the Desk works toward maintaining reserve levels, particularly around year- end, it seems appropriate to maintain overnight repo operations in order to provide a cushion against rate volatility that might occur and to enhance market participants’ confidence. The Desk would expect to offer $75 billion in overnight repos, with a minimum bid rate to","Conference Call","Press Conf","MS. LOGAN","977","2019-10"
"2019-10-04","G-SIBs retained reserve balances. These larger institutions held reserves well above their lowest comfortable levels of reserves, but didn’t increase lending in repo or in federal funds in response to higher rates. Other banks that were close to their lowest comfortable levels of reserves paid significantly higher rates in unsecured markets to defend their reserve positions. As shown in panel 5, over September 16 and 17, 70 percent of federal funds volume consisted of SFOS panel banks whose reserve balances had fallen near or below their lowest comfortable level of reserves. Funding markets in the past have been able to absorb similarly sized shocks associated with tax and Treasury settlement dates. However, one lesson from this experience may be that, against the backdrop of elevated Treasury debt issuance and declining reserves, smaller shocks can have more pronounced effects on markets. Internal risk limits and balance sheet costs seem to play a role in slowing the distribution of liquidity across the system and amplifying the shock, as financial institutions require high spreads to intermediate. A second lesson is that a higher level of reserves may be needed to accommodate distributional frictions in reserve markets. Some banks have elevated demand for reserves on days of high expected outflows, and even those that have surplus reserves may choose not to lend to other firms even at higher rates. In order to help maintain the federal funds rate within the target range, the Desk conducted large-scale repo operations starting on September 17. These played an important role in calming markets and improving funding market conditions. The addition of term operations helped provide assurances to market participants about funding markets over quarter-end. And at its peak, participation in the Desk’s overnight and term operations added $203 billion of reserves, as shown in panel 6. With these operations, September quarter-end conditions were stable, although rates were still somewhat elevated relative to recent quarter-end dates. Some of the higher repo rates passed through to the federal funds market, and the distribution of rates traded in federal funds was wider than normal. In looking ahead, market participants have expressed uncertainty about how funding market conditions may evolve after the currently announced open market operations (OMOs) roll off. As shown in the table in the Appendix, the Desk’s three term operations will mature by October 11, and the overnight operations will also expire. Market participants are also concerned about funding market conditions Forward measures of money market rates through year-end indicate expectations that pressures may build between now and December. Term repo rates remain somewhat elevated relative to overnight index swaps, and indicative pricing in repo markets for the year-end has been between 3 and 4 percent. Nearly all money market analysts expect permanent open market operations to be announced at the October meeting. Several of these analysts have indicated initial purchases are likely to be larger than purchases needed to offset organic growth in nonreserve liabilities in order to maintain reserves at current or higher levels. Analysts expect the size of these purchases to be around $225 billion, though estimates range from below $200 billion to as high as $400 billion. Expectations are split as to whether these purchases would be concentrated in Treasury bills, short coupon securities, or across the curve.

"2019-10-04","1 Thank you, Mr. Chair. Since the decision in January 2019 to remain in an ample-reserves regime, the Committee has communicated that it is on a path toward the most efficient and effective level of reserves for that regime. This initially involved relatively rapid reductions in reserves through asset redemptions and growth in nonreserve liabilities. In March, the Committee tapered asset redemptions, slowing the pace of reserve decline, and in July, the Committee ended redemptions entirely. Recent developments suggest that it may be appropriate for the FOMC to consider next steps in the process of transitioning to the efficient and effective level of reserves. I’ll start with a review of what we learned in September and the effects of our operations on market conditions. Then, I’ll discuss the outlook for the remainder of the year and what market participants are expecting. Lorie will review some key tradeoffs bearing on options that the FOMC may consider to maintain reserve levels and provide greater assurances of interest rate control, particularly around year-end. I’ll refer to exhibit 1. As shown in panel 1, overnight money market rates rose sharply the week of September 16, with contacts reporting poor liquidity and elevated uncertainty about funding market conditions. These developments also had spillover effects, with commercial paper rates and dollar borrowing costs in FX swaps rising notably. Treasury securities market liquidity in off-the-run securities deteriorated, and the Treasury cash-futures basis widened. While there had been some upward pressure in money markets on previous corporate tax payment dates, the magnitude of the moves in September was surprising. The staff analysis and market commentary has pointed to a confluence of factors related to the mid-September tax payment date and Treasury settlement. First, money fund lending in repo markets, which had been declining before mid- September, dropped sharply the week of September 16 as shown by the decline in sponsored lending volumes in the centrally cleared repo market in panel 2. The reduction in money fund repo lending resulted in a widening of the distribution of 1 The materials used by Mses.

Second, pressures in secured markets spilled over into unsecured markets and lenders pulled back from federal funds and Eurodollars out of caution about potential outflows related to tax payments or to lend at higher rates in repo.

"2019-10-04","Good morning—or afternoon—everyone. Thanks for joining the videoconference today on such short notice. I know that a number of us had to change plans to participate, and I appreciate that. I also want to thank the staff for going, really, all out since the previous meeting to bring us to this point today, when we can begin to consider a plan to get through near-term issues and from there to a stable longer-run equilibrium. We’re here to discuss the recent pressures in money markets, the steps we’ve taken so far to address those pressures, and the path forward. The matter is time sensitive, hence the need to meet today rather than wait for the next scheduled meeting at the end of October. As I noted in my email to you earlier this week, we do not need to reach any formal decisions at this meeting. However, as you will see from the briefings, we will need to reach consensus soon on a reasonable near-term plan and an associated communications strategy. Nonetheless, there will be sufficient opportunity to weigh the options, express our views, and work expeditiously to reach consensus. After the briefings, we will have a Q&A round, an opportunity to comment, and then an open discussion. As you all know, the story is a complicated one, and there are many causal factors at work. So our plan will need to involve both measures to relieve pressures that are set to intensify in the near term as well as potential measures that improve liquidity conditions over time, but that will take months of careful consideration before they can be decided on and implemented. Our main focus here today needs to be on the former: measures to get us through the end of the year and through the April tax payment season, as we’ll discuss. If we can agree on the broad outlines of our approach at this meeting, I will ask the staff to develop specific plans and communications for us to review.

"2019-10-04","Other questions? [No response] I don’t see any hands waving. All right. Let’s begin our opportunity to comment, beginning with Vice Chair Williams. with Thomas there—efforts to analyze and distill a lot of information from supervision, from our market outreach with our economists, to really come to an understanding, as best as we can, of the events in the past few weeks and to come up with policy interventions that I think have been very effective, at least in the past few weeks, at stabilizing conditions in money markets and, obviously most importantly, keeping the federal funds rate well within the range. In thinking about the topic for today and for our next meetings, I do think it’s important to start from the decision that the FOMC made, in January and then in following meetings, about having an ample-reserves operational framework. I think this is the right decision. This is the decision that, you know, we discussed at length. And we also discussed, as part of that, a plan to monitor, analyze, and assess at what point we think the level of reserves is at a level appropriate to carry out, on a sustained basis, this ample-reserves framework. And the way I think about this—and this gets back to President Evans’s comment and questions and President Rosengren’s, too—is by asking: Is it an ample-reserves regime? We are not doing regular or frequent open market operations. So that’s just, I think, the way we’ve understood it, and that’s what success will look like in the medium term. In light of the events of the past few weeks, I think that it’s really important to—the points that both Patricia and Lorie made, that we’ve actually been watching for many months an evolution in the behavior in these markets. We’ve seen the funds rate spread to the IOER rate rising gradually as the level of reserves has gone down. We’ve seen issues in terms of the spread of interest rates, and now we’ve seen, as of mid-September, just a lot more sensitivity of the repo rates and the federal funds rates to shifts in the underlying payments and demand for reserves. defensive mode. So instead of lending into that market, we saw a lot of pulling back from that and therefore, I think, amplifying some of the movements in repo rates and funding rates. And we’ve seen, as we’ve been doing regular open market operations and we did the term operations that were at quarter-end, that that concern about “I know I have funding today, but what about tomorrow and what about next week and what about quarter-end?” has damped down, and we’ve seen that be successful. We’re looking at all of these indicators over the past six months or so and especially the evidence from the past few weeks. It’s clear that we are close to, or around, a level of reserves in the system that will support an ample-reserves framework. I will just note something. You know, we talked about, why early September? How to think about that is that we were running around $1.45 trillion to $1.5 trillion in that period, and then, as we saw the reserves come down, that’s when the stress really did become amplified. As we’ve brought in up to $150 billion to $200 billion into reserves, as you can see in this chart, we did bring the total quantity of reserves, including open market operations, back up to that level, and markets seemed to be functioning. So that’s another data point that, at least over the next several months, this level seems to support well-functioning money markets. So in terms of how I’m approaching these issues, I’m thinking about the medium-term goal of getting to a sustained ample-reserves regime. If we were in a world in which everything was growing very smoothly, that would just entail growth, this organic growth, in reserve balances. But as you see in figure 7, you know, you look at the gray part of figure 7—without actions, the amount of reserves in the system, due to some seasonal and other factors, will level of reserves—we will actually see reserves decline quite a bit. If you wonder what picture keeps me up at night, it is this picture—it’s about the need to take action relatively soon, in order to keep reserves ample on a sustained basis. Again, I think about this longer-term or medium-term strategy. It does consist of both a transition to get through the year-end and a longer-term sustained level of reserves, and the way we talked about it such that the amount of total reserves in the system doesn’t dip below this current level very often. And then I think about OMOs, whether it’s a standing facility or however we operate, thinking about next April or May and on—those are only there as a backstop for quarter-ends or other days when big payment shocks cause there to be some stress in the market. Again, going back to President Rosengren’s comment, a successful ample- reserves system is one in which we are not doing frequent open market operations actively, and perhaps with some kind of backstop there just to provide that support. Again, I think an important point is what we’ve learned—and Lorie made this point very clearly—is that bank reserves are not perfect substitutes with open market operations. Open market operations, whether term or overnight, especially at scale, do not pass through directly through the financial system fully and, therefore, I think, have some important limitations, as we think about the long-run or medium-term strategy. In terms of the transition, I do think that we do need to get through the end of the year with interest rate control. That is an important part for the FOMC and for monetary policy. So we do need to have, as we transition through the next several months, a combination of purchases and a building-up of the bank reserves over a period of many months so that we have To get us through that period, given this decline in reserves, I think a combination of overnight and term repos will be there to supply reserves into the system to support the FOMC’s directive for the federal funds rate to be in the target range. I do think we need to have both of these pieces, because the long run requires us to get bank reserves higher, but to get through the next few months, we’re going to need repos to support that. And, again, I think there is a matter of needing to move quickly because we need to get the level of bank reserves higher, in order to have confidence that we have good control of the federal funds rate. In terms of delay, it just means that you have to do more per month. On the communications issue, I think it’s really important that this is not about the stance of monetary policy. This is really about the execution of monetary policy. We’ve already described our ample-reserves regime. We’re told everybody that we would be monitoring and analyzing and coming into a view, and when we got to that view, that we’re maintaining those level reserves. And so it’s really about executing on a plan that’s out there. I do think we have to avoid any perception that this is a restart of quantitative easing or of “asset purchases for monetary policy,” from the point of view of monetary policy stance. So there are some pretty strong advantages associated with gradually, initially, building the level of reserves up in such a way that we maintain the level of reserves. I think buying Treasury bills—T-bills, or potentially shorter-term Treasury securities, or both—can make that point clearly. The other thing that I, again, think is important is that we’re really trying to lay out this medium-term strategy. We are laying out a strategy about how to get through April, and that’s, I think, kind of the context of all of this. Then there’s the issue that we have to do about how do they’re already kind of thinking that that’s what we need to do, under our ample-reserves regime. I do think there are some advantages in providing greater clarity that that’s what our approach is over the next six, seven months. I think that what we’ve learned also is that with year-end coming, having that clarity and understanding in the marketplace earlier reduces some of this worry and stress around what’s going to happen at year-end and some of that behavior. I also think it’s important that we have this flexibility in our approach. One of the things that’s come up a lot is, you know, we don’t have all the answers about why things happened. There’s ambiguity about the appropriate level of reserves. There’s going to be continued learning, continuing analysis as we move forward. And so from my point of view, success right now is laying out an overarching strategy of how we plan to get through April, what success looks like. Thinking about April, how we get from here to there, but also having that flexibility that as things evolve, how are we going to adjust our decisions and plans about that. And I do think, from the point of view of market communications, that, right now, markets are not focused on us making a decision anytime soon. They are thinking we’re waiting until October. But I will assure you that between now and the October meeting, the amount of chatter and comments and articles and people talking about “What’s the Fed going to do—they need to have a plan, they don’t have a plan”—it’s just going to rise and rise. So even though they may be saying they’re not expecting anything until October, I think there’s just going to be a lot of uncertainty and debate out there. And if we’re silent on this and we’re not expressing our own strategy and plans ahead of that, I think that that could also be somewhat disruptive.

I think that a very expansive reading of “open market operations” would also include outright expansion of your outright holdings.

"2019-10-04","Okay. Thank you. Any other questions? President Daly. these things to smooth us through—and I’m not against it—are we taking away, in your estimation, any chance that the market can create some more financial resiliency by doing better about intermediating with each other?

"2019-10-04","Yes. No, it does, to some extent, depend on what we decide today. I am planning on getting that question, and I’ll have to have a good answer. If we come to a broad consensus on what to do and also agree that we might move to do that next week at a meeting, then I think it would be a good time to maybe lean a little bit forward and foreshadow that. And I would expect Vice Chair Williams to do the same, as the head of the New York Fed. So that was the thought. If we’re not there, then I’ll certainly play off what we agree to and discuss today. In a sense, if we are going to make an intermeeting announcement, it would be good to telegraph it a little bit, I think, just to sort of take some of the buzz off that so that it doesn’t seem completely out of the blue if the market already has a sense of what we’re doing. If that’s where we’re going. Again, I haven’t decided that yet. Any more questions?","Conference Call","Press Conf","CHAIR POWELL","183","2019-10"
"2019-10-04","Well, I did have one more question. I don’t mean to get ahead of anything, but we did have the options for communications items laid out. And one issue is timing there, in terms of whether or not we wait until the October FOMC meeting or we do something sooner. I think, Chair Powell, that you’re going to be speaking at the National Association of Business Economists (NABE) convention next week on Tuesday. And I guess a question I kind of have is, how do you anticipate touching on the money market issue? Or would you be thinking about talking about it at all?","Conference Call","Press Conf","MR. EVANS","104","2019-10"
"2019-10-04","So the way we were framing the discussion about “organic growth” is meant to be the average trend growth in all of the Federal Reserve’s liabilities—which would include some trend growth in reserves as well. And so, on average, over the course of a year, I used the number of $20 billion per month. Of course, that would depend importantly on the forecast of that trend growth, but something in that order of magnitude. Those purchases, depending on the level of buffer that the Committee decided to hold above this minimum level of reserves—that average pace might differ. So, for example, if there was a lower level of buffer above this minimum level of reserves, then that $20 billion per month might be quite volatile over the course of the year to maintain reserves above that level. It would still average that over the course of the year, but some months those purchases may be larger, and other months those purchases may be smaller. If the Committee were to decide to maintain a larger buffer over the minimum, then those average purchases would be more consistent across months over the course of the year. Evans.","Conference Call","Press Conf","MS. LOGAN","195","2019-10"
"2019-10-04","Just getting back to the Chair’s question, we’re using this “organic growth of the balance sheet” term pretty loosely. Can you just—what are we talking about? Is this trend growth in currency? Are you really thinking about compensating for all shocks to nonreserve liabilities and keeping that kind of smooth? It just seems important for this question about how much we’re going to be intervening.","Conference Call","Press Conf","MS. BRAINARD","65","2019-10"
"2019-10-04","I can discuss that question in the context of the Senior Financial Officer Survey, which is how we’ve learned about reserve demand, and through conversations with market participants. The majority of the Senior Financial Officer Survey respondents noted that internal liquidity stress tests and high-payment flow days were the determinants of their lowest comfortable level of reserves (LCLoRs), and so each of those banks responded for their own estimates of what their stress payment outflows might be. Some banks consider this lowest comfortable level of reserves to be a hard floor. So it’s a governance minimum, and they tend to hold cushions above that to make sure they don’t breach that level. It could be that on high payment flow days, banks increase the cushion that they want to hold above those LCLoRs, and we heard a little bit about that from banks that day. So it might be that, under some circumstances, banks increase their demand for reserves on days that have high-payment flows. Also, on some high-payment flow days, banks end up with unexpected surpluses of reserves. And what we know from the survey is that banks are not willing to lend those reserves to other banks in the interbank market, and we think of that as distributional frictions. I think we had a sense before that there were distributional frictions that we couldn’t measure, and we talked about that a few times. I think what we found is that they are quite large, and the willingness of banks to give up these surplus reserves above the governance minimum is actually quite low, whereas we thought, in some environments, they may have been willing to relax those distributional frictions that may result in a higher level of reserves being needed.","Conference Call","Press Conf","MS. ZOBEL","292","2019-10"
"2019-10-04","Thanks. This is just following up, I think, on President Evans’s question one more time. We had a previous estimate. That estimate didn’t play out the way we expected it to. Do we have any insight as to why? Did the banks that we talked to misestimate or market movements? Just—do we have any insight as to why? That would help me on where we want to go.","Conference Call","Press Conf","MR. BARKIN","68","2019-10"
"2019-10-04","I think the focus that this projection is based on is the idea of limiting volatility over this short-run period: targeting a minimum level of reserves from early September plus the overnight operations. The longer-run level of reserves, such that you are relying purely on purchases, would likely be higher, but would importantly depend on the Committee’s discussions about whether to maintain a standing repo facility or to take other actions to reduce nonreserve liabilities or changes in policy related to the demand for reserves. I think that question would need to be in the context of those longer-term questions.","Conference Call","Press Conf","MS. LOGAN","100","2019-10"
"2019-10-04","So, with the extra. $100 billion for the April period, and then after that you would grow, on average, whatever we determine to be that organic growth number.","Conference Call","Press Conf","CHAIR POWELL","28","2019-10"
"2019-10-04","Okay, thank you. So a quick follow-up to that. In previous meetings, I thought the staff was being too conservative in your “buffers on top of your buffers.” Pretty clearly, I was wrong about that. I guess my question here is, if we’re going to do something somewhat extraordinary, do we want now to build in more of a buffer and just make sure that we don’t have any hiccups or surprises, between now and April? And so my question is—and we can talk about it later in the actual go-round—do we need to have more of a buffer if we’re going to do something extraordinary right now than what appears to be in the proposal? So that’s just kind of a comment. policy, we’re talking about the implementation of monetary policy. Is it remotely possible that this could be a Desk communication, which would turn the heat down a little bit and put more focus on “this is just technical details of how we implement policy,” so that there’s less confusion that the FOMC is changing its stance of policy? Thank you.","Conference Call","Press Conf","MR. KASHKARI","183","2019-10"
"2019-10-04","In terms of the projection that we’re showing through the end of the year, as I mentioned earlier, the amount we’re trying to fill by the end of 2019 was $250 billion. We would need to fill another $100 billion before April 2020. That would be inclusive of thinking about organic growth during that period, but organic growth purchases over the course of a year would probably average around $15 billion to $20 billion per month generally. But, in this first part, there’s an amount that’s needed well above that average organic growth over the course of the year.","Conference Call","Press Conf","MS. LOGAN","99","2019-10"
"2019-10-04","Thank you, Thomas. I think, also, just in terms of the memo itself, our focus was on the transition over these three months and not to define the steady state—which is where Thomas focused in his comments. In terms of the overall size, in the memo we proposed $60 billion of bills per month in the illustrative scenario 1. Based on some analysis that we’ve done looking at changes in the supply of Treasury securities when the Treasury has needed to move the bill supply up and down fairly rapidly, for reasons related to the debt ceiling, we’ve gained some experience about the amount of bill supply in the short run that wouldn’t affect market functioning. Of course, we would learn along the way, but we think to start somewhere around $60 billion, maybe a little bit higher, is where we’d feel comfortable from a market-functioning perspective. short coupon securities or even a little bit further out along the Treasury curve to get to a total of maybe $80 billion per month or a little above $80 billion over a one-month horizon. But I think, from an initial starting place, that’s where we’d feel comfortable from a market-functioning perspective.","Conference Call","Press Conf","MS. LOGAN","199","2019-10"
"2019-10-04","Tom also has a question. I’ll go first. I actually have two questions. The first question gets to the word “efficient.” I was thinking that “efficient amount of reserves” referred to the amount of reserves necessary so that we didn’t have to do overnight or term repos (RPs). And this memo seems to have a different definition of what “efficient” is that somehow allows both term and overnight RPs to go up or down, sometimes by fairly substantial amounts. So it would be useful to get a clearer definition of whether “efficient” means we don’t have to do overnight and term RPs and our balance sheet is sufficiently large that we don’t have to do that, or—what is the alternative definition to what “efficient” means? That’s my first question. And my second question is, if we think “efficient” is actually trying to avoid doing all this intervention by the Markets Group on a more regular basis, how many bills and notes could we buy over a relatively short period to expand our balance sheet so that we don’t have as much purchase of bills, in order to get up to a higher level, what would the quantity be that would start becoming disruptive? Thank you.","Conference Call","Press Conf","MR. ROSENGREN","205","2019-10"
"2019-10-04","Yes, I just want to point out, there’s one issue about this level, just to clarify. When you talk about a level of a certain dollar amount, it sounds like we’re targeting that level, and when you think about using temporary open market operations, you really can’t think about targeting the level of reserves when you’re relying on those open market operations. Because, as we’ve seen, the take-up of those operations depends on the circumstances at that point in time. Even with this plan, we can easily see the amount of reserves, inclusive of the open-market operations, fall below $1.4 trillion. So there’s a communications issue about, really, what we’re trying to do, I would think, is supply a level of reserves into the system and consistent with the level of reserves that we’ve seen in early","Conference Call","Press Conf","VICE CHAIR WILLIAMS","137","2019-10"
"2019-10-04","I think there was a sense that, from a communications perspective, there was some benefit in focusing on returning to a level before these events took place, but not being so precise at this point. From a market perspective, I think what they will do is look at the H.4.1 numbers from the first and the second week of September, and I think they will begin to communicate that it’s a level of $1.45 trillion based on that information. Really, that’s a communications decision for the Committee and an important discussion point for today.","Conference Call","Press Conf","MS. LOGAN","94","2019-10"
"2019-10-04","So, Lorie, and maybe Thomas, is there a reason that you’re focusing on the date, early September, rather than telling the markets the level you’re doing? Is that because you don’t want to associate a level—because you may change the level later on?","Conference Call","Press Conf","MS. MESTER","43","2019-10"
"2019-10-04","Thank you, Thomas. I agree with Thomas that providing the sense of early September gives the market a focal point for what we’re trying to achieve over the shorter- run period. I think that would be associated with communications about continued discussion that the Committee would be having on the efficient and effective level of reserves. In terms of market expectations, we haven’t seen a lot, in terms of the level of reserves the Committee would choose to maintain over some longer horizon. We’ve only seen a few market participants give a figure along those lines. I think most of the discussion that we’ve seen in the market is focused on a near-term issue, and there’s a general understanding that the longer- run level of reserves that the Committee would deem to be efficient and effective would be influenced by other policies. And there’s some expectation that there’s going to be discussion of a standing repo facility or other policies that could affect the overall demand for reserves of individual institutions. In my view, the communications about the near term is what the market will focus on, and then, after that, they’ll start making broader predictions or expectations about where the Committee is heading over a period that goes beyond the end of the year.","Conference Call","Press Conf","MS. LOGAN","215","2019-10"
"2019-10-04","I will defer to Lorie in terms of, you know, how market participants might view the early September level as a focal point.

"2019-10-04","Thank you, Mr. Chair. So my question, I guess, piggybacks off both President Evans and President Kashkari. Back to this September thing. I don’t want to put too much weight on it, but we do seem to be hovering around “Let’s get it back to September.” But we’ve been—as Patricia briefed us, we started to see some movement, some volatility that might have been a warning sign all the way back in March. And so my question is, really, when we’re communicating about building reserves back up to get through the next several months, do we really need to put a date at which we’re targeting it, or can we learn?

"2019-12-11","Well, I think you can—you know, it’s—I think you can see that what’s been moving—one way to look at it is, what’s been moving financial markets?","Q&A","Press Conf","","26","2019-12"
"2019-12-11","It’s just been—it’s in estimates not just at the Fed, but among—broadly among economists—labor economists have seen that the connection—that we can sustain much lower levels of unemployment than had been thought.","Q&A","Press Conf","","32","2019-12"
"2019-12-11","You know, the Fed has great inflation credibility, but inflation expectations are anchored at about their 25-year average, which is a few ticks below 2 percent.","Q&A","Press Conf","","26","2019-12"
"2019-12-11","Ultimately, it will take time to establish—to move inflation expectations up from where they are, which appears to be a bit below 2 percent, will not happen overnight.","Q&A","Press Conf","","28","2019-12"
"2019-12-11","And so the— the changes that we’re looking at to the framework are—I think they take all of that on board, and—but they’re—what they’re—what they are designed to do is to strengthen the credibility of that—of that inflation target, but only if followed by policy.","Q&A","Press Conf","","45","2019-12"
"2019-12-11","And I would also point out that this year, which has been a good year for the economy, inflation—core inflation is actually running at 1.6 percent, whereas it ran close to 2 percent most of last year.","Q&A","Press Conf","","37","2019-12"
"2019-12-11","It’s been very challenging to get inflation to be at target.","Q&A","Press Conf","","11","2019-12"
"2019-12-11","And, as I mentioned, that’s a good thing because that means we—we don’t have to worry so much about inflation.","Q&A","Press Conf","","20","2019-12"
"2019-12-11","And that’s—and you see the benefits of that in today’s labor market.","Q&A","Press Conf","","12","2019-12"
"2019-12-11","I—you know, the Fed Listens events are about inflation to a much lesser extent than they are about maximum employment.","Q&A","Press Conf","","20","2019-12"
"2019-12-11","And—and the risks of, you know, using accommodative monetary policy, our tool, to explore that are relatively low.","Q&A","Press Conf","","18","2019-12"
"2019-12-11","In fact, it’s already—it’s already understood, I think, that—that there’s more—even though we’re at 3½ percent unemployment, there’s actually more slack out there, in a sense.","Q&A","Press Conf","","26","2019-12"
"2019-12-11","You know, I—I think we have kind of internalized—and this isn’t— this isn’t news for today, this is something we’ve been saying for, you know, for several years— you’ve seen us moving down our estimates of the—of maximum employment.","Q&A","Press Conf","","39","2019-12"
"2019-12-11","And I think that does also inform our understanding of what we mean by “maximum employment.” And it’s been a very positive—I would say that the Fed Listens events have been—have been extraordinarily positive, and they’re certainly something we’ll repeat.","Q&A","Press Conf","","40","2019-12"
"2019-12-11","And I think that the fact that these communities have so much— such high levels of unemployment and low levels of labor force participation tells you that there is slack out there.","Q&A","Press Conf","","32","2019-12"
"2019-12-11","But it was help to get—helpful to get it in the context of a monetary policy review.","Q&A","Press Conf","","17","2019-12"
"2019-12-11","If you’ve—if you’ve listened to or attended any of those, the discussion—we always focus on inflation as well, but the discussion is really around what’s happening in low- and moderate-income communities and among small businesses.","Q&A","Press Conf","","35","2019-12"
"2019-12-11","And what it is is, it’s an expression of the thinking about individual Committee members about appropriate monetary policy and the path of the economy.","Q&A","Press Conf","","25","2019-12"
"2019-12-11","The level of wage inflation has actually moved down, although, there may be compositional effects in that number that may—that may be, to some extent, about younger workers coming in at lower wages that—than retiring workers.","Q&A","Press Conf","","36","2019-12"

"2019-12-11","And, again, at the end of the day, that probably has most to do with productivity.","Q&A","Press Conf","","16","2019-12"
"2019-12-11","Another thing is, though, that the labor market may not be as tight as we had thought it was.","Q&A","Press Conf","","19","2019-12"

"2019-12-11","Productivity has been low, and that—that is very likely to be holding back wages.","Q&A","Press Conf","","14","2019-12"
"2019-12-11","So wages should go up to cover inflation and productivity.","Q&A","Press Conf","","10","2019-12"

"2019-12-11","And it’s a very positive thing, but it does sort of provide more labor supply, meaning a less tight labor market.","Q&A","Press Conf","","21","2019-12"
"2019-12-11","You know, we look at countless measures of labor market—you know, labor utilization, and there’s so many— it’s too many to count.","Q&A","Press Conf","","22","2019-12"

"2020-08-27","Thus, our approach could be viewed as a flexible form of average inflation targeting.26Our decisions about appropriate monetary policy will continue to reflect a broad array of considerations and will not be dictated by any formula.","General","Speech","N/A","36","2020-08"
"2020-08-27","In seeking to achieve inflation that averages 2 percent over time, we are not tying ourselves to a particular mathematical formula that defines the average.","General","Speech","N/A","25","2020-08"

"2020-08-27","Households and businesses will come to expect this result, meaning that inflation expectations would tend to move below our inflation goal and pull realized inflation down.","General","Speech","N/A","26","2020-08"
"2020-08-27","Overall, our new Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy conveys our continued strong commitment to achieving our goals, given the difficult challenges presented by the proximity of interest rates to the effective lower bound.","General","Speech","N/A","36","2020-08"
"2020-08-27","However, if inflation runs below 2 percent following economic downturns but never moves above 2 percent even when the economy is strong, then, over time, inflation will average less than 2 percent.","General","Speech","N/A","32","2020-08"

"2020-08-27","The change to ""shortfalls"" clarifies that, going forward, employment can run at or above real-time estimates of its maximum level without causing concern, unless accompanied by signs of unwanted increases in inflation or the emergence of other risks that could impede the attainment of our goals.25Of course, when employment is below its maximum level, as is clearly the case now, we will actively seek to minimize that shortfall by using our tools to support economic growth and job creation.","General","Speech","N/A","79","2020-08"
"2020-08-27","It was sometimes appropriate for the Fed to tighten monetary policy as employment rose toward its estimated maximum level in order to stave off an unwelcome rise in inflation.","General","Speech","N/A","29","2020-08"
"2020-08-27","In earlier decades when the Phillips curve was steeper, inflation tended to rise noticeably in response to a strengthening labor market.","General","Speech","N/A","21","2020-08"
"2020-08-27","This change reflects our appreciation for the benefits of a strong labor market, particularly for many in low- and moderate-income communities.23In addition, our revised statement says that our policy decision will be informed by our ""assessments of theshortfallsof employment from its maximum level"" rather than by ""deviationsfrom its maximum level"" as in our previous statement.24This change may appear subtle, but it reflects our view that a robust job market can be sustained without causing an outbreak of inflation.","General","Speech","N/A","78","2020-08"
"2020-08-27","With regard to the employment side of our mandate, our revised statement emphasizes that maximum employment is a broad-based and inclusive goal.","General","Speech","N/A","22","2020-08"
"2020-08-27","By reducing our scope to support the economy by cutting interest rates, the lower bound increases downward risks to employment and inflation.22To counter these risks, we are prepared to use our full range of tools to support the economy.","General","Speech","N/A","39","2020-08"

"2020-09-16","So, so I would just say, the right—in our discussions the last couple of days, the whole Committee, everybody on the Committee is very supportive of the Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy and what’s in there—very, very broad support, unanimous support for that.","Q&A","Press Conf","","46","2020-09"

"2020-11-05","As with overall economic activity, the pace of improvement in the labor market has moderated.","Opening Statement","Press Conf","","15","2020-11"
"2020-11-05","The unemployment rate declined over the past five months but remained elevated at 7.9 percent as of September.","Opening Statement","Press Conf","","18","2020-11"
"2020-11-05","In particular, the high level of joblessness has been especially severe for lower-wage workers in the services sector, for women, and for African Americans and Hispanics.","Opening Statement","Press Conf","","26","2020-11"
"2020-11-05","The pandemic has also left a significant imprint on inflation.","Opening Statement","Press Conf","","10","2020-11"
"2020-11-05","Following large declines in the spring, consumer prices picked up over the summer, in part reflecting a rise in durable goods prices.","Opening Statement","Press Conf","","22","2020-11"
"2020-11-05","However, for those sectors that have been most affected by the pandemic, prices remain particularly soft.","Opening Statement","Press Conf","","16","2020-11"
"2020-11-05","Overall, on a 12-month basis, inflation remains below our 2 percent longer-run objective.","Opening Statement","Press Conf","","13","2020-11"

"2020-11-05","As noted in our Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, we view maximum employment as a “broad-based and inclusive goal.” Our ability to achieve maximum employment in the years ahead depends importantly on inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time so that inflation averages 2 percent over time and longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2 percent.","Opening Statement","Press Conf","","61","2020-11"
"2020-11-05","With regard to interest rates, we continue to expect that it will be appropriate to maintain the current 0 to ¼ percent target range for the federal funds rate until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee’s assessments of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time.","Opening Statement","Press Conf","","63","2020-11"
"2020-11-05","So, on the first—the first question, it’s—our asset purchases are serving both purchases, both—sorry, both purposes: financial market function and support for economic activity.","Q&A","Press Conf","","24","2020-11"
"2020-11-05","That’s the case for, for all different measures in the labor force—in the labor market, rather.","Q&A","Press Conf","","16","2020-11"
"2020-11-05","Right now, we think that this very large, effective program is delivering about the right amount of accommodation and support for the markets, and so it continues.","Q&A","Press Conf","","27","2020-11"
"2020-11-05","And it’s just providing a lot of support for, for economic activity and, by the way, removing just about the same amount of duration risk from private hands as QE3 did.","Q&A","Press Conf","","31","2020-11"
"2020-11-05","So we’re not taking our gains in financial market function for granted, although, admittedly, they’ve been very large.","Q&A","Press Conf","","18","2020-11"
"2020-11-05","So, first, let me say, we do think that the facilities have, have generally served their purposes well, particularly in supporting the flow of credit, particularly acting as backstops to private markets.","Q&A","Press Conf","","32","2020-11"
"2020-11-05","And, and those are—that’s again—that goes to keeping this episode as short as it can be and avoiding unnecessary business bankruptcies, unnecessary household bankruptcies, and unnecessary long- term stays of unemployment or supporting people through them so that they can maintain their financial footing and their lives and be able to go back to work in a productive way.","Q&A","Press Conf","","59","2020-11"
"2020-11-05","So in terms of what they can do, first I would just say, the purchases that we have in place are providing strong support to economic activity still.","Q&A","Press Conf","","28","2020-11"
"2020-11-05","And, you know, we’re, we’re sort of halfway there on the labor market recovery at best.","Q&A","Press Conf","","16","2020-11"
"2020-11-05","So—and that’s really been true—I think in the very beginning of the crisis, purchases are also supporting economic activity, and that’s important.","Q&A","Press Conf","","22","2020-11"
"2020-12-16","There’s also a sense that this—some of this may be pent-up demand from when the economy was closed, which would imply that demand—once that demand is met, that the real level of demand will be more manageable.","Q&A","Press Conf","","37","2020-12"
"2020-12-16","But, no, housing prices themselves are not—are not a financial stability concern at the moment.","Q&A","Press Conf","","15","2020-12"
"2020-12-16","And, you know, so I guess since September we’ve now adopted a flexible average inflation-targeting framework.","Q&A","Press Conf","","16","2020-12"
"2020-12-16","So I would—I would say, though, that in the near term, the help that people need isn’t just from low interest rates that stimulates demand over time and works with long and variable lags.","Q&A","Press Conf","","34","2020-12"
"2020-12-16","And, and then, you know, not many, when the—when the pandemic hit, thought, “Oh, this is what—this is what will produce that housing market,” but it has.","Q&A","Press Conf","","27","2020-12"
"2020-12-16","You see very high demand.","Q&A","Press Conf","","5","2020-12"
"2020-12-16","You know, so we monitor basically just about every asset price in the economy, and housing prices are something that we’ve been monitoring.","Q&A","Press Conf","","23","2020-12"
"2020-12-16","This, this is the housing market that people have been expecting since, you know, 2010.","Q&A","Press Conf","","15","2020-12"
"2020-12-16","We have, and others too, have consistently expected there to be more economic—that, that cases would hold—growth in cases would hold back the economy more than it actually has.","Q&A","Press Conf","","29","2020-12"
"2020-12-16","And the persistence of inflation, if you—if you get a—for example, oil prices go up, and that’ll send a temporary shock through the economy.","Q&A","Press Conf","","24","2020-12"
"2020-12-16","The persistence of that into, into inflation over time is just not there.","Q&A","Press Conf","","13","2020-12"
"2020-12-16","But I would—I would expect, though, going in that that would be a one-time price increase rather than an increase in underlying inflation that would be persistent.","Q&A","Press Conf","","27","2020-12"
"2020-12-16","Yes, I, I don’t think it’s at all a foregone conclusion that there needs to be a time when the economy needs highly accommodative monetary policy, and we think our asset purchases are, you know, one of the main delivery mechanisms for that, the size of the balance sheet.","Q&A","Press Conf","","49","2020-12"
"2020-12-16","So that was the inflation—those are the inflation dynamics of that era.","Q&A","Press Conf","","12","2020-12"
"2020-12-16","You know, there’s lots of demand for, for","Q&A","Press Conf","","8","2020-12"
"2020-12-16","We actually have a framework so that we can, you know, be—evaluate changes in financial stability over time, and so that the public can evaluate whether we’re doing a job—a good job at it.","Q&A","Press Conf","","34","2020-12"
"2020-12-16","I mean, really, really, that’s what happens is, people internalize that they can raise prices, and that it’s okay to pay prices that are going up at that rate.","Q&A","Press Conf","","29","2020-12"
"2020-12-16","So if prices went up 6 percent this year, they’d go up 6 percent next year, because people would internalize.","Q&A","Press Conf","","20","2020-12"
"2020-12-16","But also, I would remind—I would also note, though, monetary policy works with “long and variable lags,” is the famous statement.","Q&A","Press Conf","","21","2020-12"
"2020-12-16","So we think that the big effects from monetary policy are, you know, months and months into the future.","Q&A","Press Conf","","19","2020-12"
"2020-12-16","So we, we remain open to doing—you know, to, to either increasing the size of our asset purchases, if that turns out to be appropriate, or to just moving the maturities, moving to buying longer maturities, because that had—that also increases accommodation by taking more duration risk out of the market.","Q&A","Press Conf","","51","2020-12"
"2020-12-16","Again, what we’ve—what we’ve done is, we’ve laid out a path whereby we’re going to keep monetary policy highly accommodative for a long time, really until—really until we reach very close to our goals, which is not, you know, not really the way it’s been done in the past.","Q&A","Press Conf","","49","2020-12"
"2020-12-16","We think it’s suffering from the pandemic and people wanting to not engage in certain kinds of economic activity.","Q&A","Press Conf","","19","2020-12"
"2020-12-16","So that, that has all the markings of a transient increase in the price level.","Q&A","Press Conf","","15","2020-12"
"2020-12-16","But what inflation is, is a process whereby they go up year upon year upon year upon year.","Q&A","Press Conf","","18","2020-12"
"2020-12-16","And if—given the inflation dynamics that we’ve had over the last several decades, just a single, single sort of price-level increase has not resulted in ongoing price-level increases.","Q&A","Press Conf","","28","2020-12"
"2020-12-16","One, when unemployment went down and resources got tight, prices started going up.","Q&A","Press Conf","","13","2020-12"
"2020-12-16","Asset prices is one thing that we look at.","Q&A","Press Conf","","9","2020-12"
"2020-12-16","For my way of thinking and many others’, the time to focus on that is when the economy is strong and when unemployment is low and taxes are—you know, are, are pouring in, and there’s, there’s room to get on—get on a sustainable path, because the economy’s really doing well.","Q&A","Press Conf","","50","2020-12"
"2020-12-16","In particular, you can look at the real interest rate payments, the amount of, what does it cost?","Q&A","Press Conf","","18","2020-12"
"2020-12-16","And from that standpoint, if you—if you sort of take real interest costs of the federal deficit and divide that by GDP, we’re actually—you know, we’re actually on a more sustainable fiscal path if you look at it through those eyes.","Q&A","Press Conf","","41","2020-12"
"2020-12-16","congressional interference in monetary policymaking or at least feel significant political pressure to keep rates low because the country can’t afford to pay a significant interest bill?","Q&A","Press Conf","","27","2020-12"
"2020-12-16","I think, you know, if we—if we do our jobs well and support the economy and achieve maximum employment and stable prices, keep the financial system stable, I don’t think that that is something that will—that I would worry about, certainly not in the near term.","Q&A","Press Conf","","46","2020-12"
"2020-12-16","You know, we’re, we’re monitoring these prices for that and, and have published our, our framework, and, you know, we’ll be held accountable for what we saw and what we missed.","Q&A","Press Conf","","31","2020-12"
"2020-12-16","And that’s not at, at incredibly low levels, which would mean that they’re not overpriced in that sense.","Q&A","Press Conf","","18","2020-12"

"2020-12-16","And that’s sort of why we’re—one reason why we’re concerned about inflation is that we see that.","Q&A","Press Conf","","17","2020-12"
"2020-12-16","And, and that’s why we have adopted the flexible average inflation-targeting framework.","Q&A","Press Conf","","12","2020-12"
"2020-12-16","And, you know, we’ve been having very long expansions since—in, in the last several decades because inflation has not—really, the old model was, inflation would come along and the Fed would tighten, and we’d have a recession.","Q&A","Press Conf","","37","2020-12"
"2020-12-16","Now inflation has been low, and we haven’t had that dynamic.","Q&A","Press Conf","","11","2020-12"

"2021-06-16","And, but we, we do think—you’ve got to—you’ve got to think in the labor market right now, where, where supply and demand are just not matched up well.","Q&A","Press Conf","","28","2021-06"
"2021-06-16","price jumps we’ve seen in some raw materials—lumber, for example, you mentioned that earlier—seem to be easing.","Q&A","Press Conf","","17","2021-06"

"2021-06-16","We look at a range of indicators, and it’s a very broad range, you can count to a high number just quickly—but, but, certainly, it will include things like unemployment and participation and wages and many different flavors of that.","Q&A","Press Conf","","40","2021-06"
"2021-06-16","So I think we’re—I think that lesson number one is, is just to be careful about assessing maximum employment.","Q&A","Press Conf","","19","2021-06"
"2021-06-16","And I think if you—during the last cycle, there were—there were waves of concern that we were reaching full employment as early, all going to be informed by that.","Q&A","Press Conf","","29","2021-06"
"2021-06-16","And what we’re seeing is—we don’t see anything that’s troubling in the sense of—what would be troubling would be, you know, very wide across the economy, wages at unsustainable levels without high inflation.","Q&A","Press Conf","","33","2021-06"
"2021-06-16","In other words, wages in excess of productivity and inflation, you know, by a meaningful amount broadly across the economy, sort of forcing companies to keep raising prices and getting into a wage–price cycle.","Q&A","Press Conf","","34","2021-06"
"2021-06-16","That’s, that’s the old formula for—one of the old formulas for having high inflation.","Q&A","Press Conf","","14","2021-06"
"2021-06-16","So, really, the problem now is, is that demand is very, very strong.","Q&A","Press Conf","","13","2021-06"
"2021-06-16","You know, I think, clearly, since March what’s happened is, people have grown more confident in these very strong outcomes, that they’ll be strong labor demand.","Q&A","Press Conf","","26","2021-06"
"2021-06-16","We’ve also seen—we have seen inflation above target, though, and I think even though, you know, in, in our forecasters’ case, they do see inflation coming back down over ’22 and ’23 into, into areas that are very consistent with our—with our mandate.","Q&A","Press Conf","","43","2021-06"
"2021-06-16","Nonetheless, the risk is, is something that can factor into people’s thinking about appropriate monetary policy.","Q&A","Press Conf","","16","2021-06"
"2021-06-16","Demand for goods is extremely high, and it hasn’t— it hasn’t come down.","Q&A","Press Conf","","13","2021-06"
"2021-06-16","And so you’re seeing prices are moving back up off their lows there.","Q&A","Press Conf","","13","2021-06"
"2021-06-16","But in terms of, of overcorrecting, I mean, I think there, there is a possibility on the other side of this that, that inflation could be—could actually be quite low going forward.","Q&A","Press Conf","","32","2021-06"
"2021-06-16","Our focus right now is, we need to—our, our expectation is that these, these high inflation readings that we’re seeing now will start to abate.","Q&A","Press Conf","","25","2021-06"
"2021-06-16","With things like airplane tickets and hotels, which are the other two factors in the most recent CPI report that went up a lot, we expect that those prices will get back up to where they were, but there’s no reason to think that they’re going to keep going up happen.","Q&A","Press Conf","","51","2021-06"
"2021-06-16","I think in terms of the timing and the effects on inflation in the near term, there’s a lot of uncertainty.","Q&A","Press Conf","","21","2021-06"
"2021-06-16","And the risk would be that over time, it does begin to affect inflation expectations.","Q&A","Press Conf","","15","2021-06"
"2021-06-16","And if we see inflation expectations and inflation—or inflation moving up in a way that is really materially above what we—what we would see as consistent with our goals, and persistently so, we wouldn’t hesitate to use our tools to address that.","Q&A","Press Conf","","42","2021-06"
"2021-06-16","Price stability is half of our mandate, and we would certainly do that.","Q&A","Press Conf","","13","2021-06"
"2021-06-16","And I do think it could have some effect on, on broader money market conditions below as it relates to, you know, the very low rates and the downward pressures.","Q&A","Press Conf","","30","2021-06"
"2021-06-16","So we, we do tend to look at the longer-term inflation expectations, because that’s really, we think, what matters for, for inflation.","Q&A","Press Conf","","22","2021-06"
"2021-06-16","So and, and, you know, the shorter-term ones do tend to move around based on, for example, gasoline prices.","Q&A","Press Conf","","19","2021-06"
"2021-06-16","So you’ll see if gasoline prices were to spike, you’ll see the shorter-term inflation expectation measures, particularly the surveys, move up.","Q&A","Press Conf","","21","2021-06"
"2021-06-16","And, and that’s, that’s maybe not a good signal for future inflation if, if gas happens to spike and then go back down again.","Q&A","Press Conf","","24","2021-06"
"2021-06-16","know, sort of further exacerbating concerns that we might find ourselves where, for example, the ECB and the Bank of Japan have been, where you have expectations and inflation itself sliding down and you have a really hard time stopping that process once it begins.","Q&A","Press Conf","","45","2021-06"
"2021-06-16","So it’s, it’s good, actually, to see inflation—longer-term inflation expectations move back up to a range—it’s a range that’s consistent with what our objectives are.","Q&A","Press Conf","","25","2021-06"
"2021-06-16","And that’s why we look at a broad range of them and tend to look at the movement of that broad range of, of, of indicators, which are from, you know, surveys of economists, surveys of the public, and also market based.","Q&A","Press Conf","","42","2021-06"
"2021-06-16","And, by the way, they’ve been broadly higher than that, somewhat modestly higher than that, not so many years ago, at a time when inflation was, was, was still anchored at around 2 percent or maybe even a little bit below.","Q&A","Press Conf","","41","2021-06"
"2021-06-16","And, you know, as you know, it’s, it’s fundamental in our framework, our new framework, to, to assure that inflation—longer-term inflation expectations are anchored at a place that is consistent with our goal.","Q&A","Press Conf","","33","2021-06"
"2021-06-16","If, if inflation expectations are not anchored at a place that’s consistent with your goal, it’s not clear why you would expect to hit your goal over the longer term.","Q&A","Press Conf","","30","2021-06"
"2021-06-16","So inflation has come in above expectations over the last few months.","Q&A","Press Conf","","12","2021-06"
"2021-06-16","So, for example, the experience with, with lumber prices is, is illustrative of this.","Q&A","Press Conf","","14","2021-06"
"2021-06-16","And I think the full range of, of, of inflation projections for 2023 falls between 2 and 2.3 percent, which is consistent with our—with our goals.","Q&A","Press Conf","","26","2021-06"
"2021-06-16","If you look at the—if you look at the forecast for 2021 and—sorry, 2022 and 2023 among my colleagues on the, on the Federal Open Market Committee, you will see that people do expect inflation to move down meaningfully toward our goal.","Q&A","Press Conf","","42","2021-06"
"2021-06-16","So I, I can’t give you an exact number or an exact time, but I would say that we do expect inflation to move down.","Q&A","Press Conf","","25","2021-06"
"2021-06-16","I’ll, I’ll also say that the labor market is going to be important, both for the maximum- employment goal, but also for inflation.","Q&A","Press Conf","","23","2021-06"
"2021-06-16","Used car prices are going up because of sort of a perfect storm of very strong demand and limited supply.","Q&A","Press Conf","","20","2021-06"
"2021-06-16","Another example where we haven’t seen that yet is prices for used cars, which accounted for more than a third of the total increase in core inflation.","Q&A","Press Conf","","27","2021-06"
"2021-06-16","The thought is that prices like that that have moved up really quickly because of the shortages and bottlenecks and the like, they should stop going up, and at some point, they, they, in some cases, should actually go down.","Q&A","Press Conf","","40","2021-06"
"2021-06-16","But if you look behind the headline numbers, you’ll see that the incoming data are, are consistent with the view that prices—that prices that are driving that higher inflation are from categories that are being directly affected by the recovery from the pandemic and the reopening of the economy.","Q&A","Press Conf","","49","2021-06"
"2021-06-16","You know, so as part of our year-and-a-half-long process, the review that we did and came out with at the end of that with the—with the new Statement on Longer- Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, we looked carefully at the idea.","Q&A","Press Conf","","42","2021-06"
"2021-06-16","You know, it says that we will seek to—seek inflation that runs moderately above 2 percent for some time.","Q&A","Press Conf","","19","2021-06"
"2021-06-16","And it’s, it’s meant to create a broad sense that we want inflation to average 2 percent over time.","Q&A","Press Conf","","19","2021-06"
"2021-06-16","So on the—on the facility, we think it’s doing its job.","Q&A","Press Conf","","11","2021-06"
"2021-06-16","We think it’s doing—the reverse repo facility is, is doing what it’s supposed to do, which is to provide a floor under money market rates and keep the federal funds rate well within its—well within its range.","Q&A","Press Conf","","37","2021-06"
"2021-06-16","The conditions for liftoff—we’re very far from maximum employment, for example.","Q&A","Press Conf","","11","2021-06"

"2021-07-28","There may be modest differences in terms of, of contribution to housing prices, but it’s, it’s not something that’s big.","Q&A","Press Conf","","20","2021-07"
"2021-07-28","We, we want inflation expectations to be centered on, on 2 percent.","Q&A","Press Conf","","12","2021-07"
"2021-07-28","Look, we—as you know, we’re targeting a moderate overshoot of 2 percent inflation for some time.","Q&A","Press Conf","","16","2021-07"
"2021-07-28","I mean, money markets, private money market funds are, are choosing to, to invest because the rates are attractive.","Q&A","Press Conf","","19","2021-07"
"2021-07-28","You know, it’s essentially, essentially, what’s happening is that it just results in a lower aggregate amount of Federal Reserve liabilities that are in banks in the form of reserves and a higher amount of Federal Reserve liabilities in money market funds in the form of overnight RRP balances.","Q&A","Press Conf","","49","2021-07"
"2021-07-28","So, really, it’s, it’s to support the function of—functioning of monetary policy and its, its effectiveness.","Q&A","Press Conf","","16","2021-07"
"2021-07-28","So it’s, it’s set at 25 basis points, so out of the money, and it’s, it’s there to help address pressures in money market—money markets that could impede the effective implementation of monetary policy.","Q&A","Press Conf","","34","2021-07"
"2021-07-28","Your question on, on the, the [ON]RRP, so we think it’s doing what it’s supposed to do, what we expect of it to do, which is to help provide a floor for money market rates and help ensure that the federal funds, funds rate stays within the target range.","Q&A","Press Conf","","49","2021-07"
"2021-07-28","Price stability, for us, means inflation averaging 2 percent over time.","Q&A","Press Conf","","11","2021-07"
"2021-07-28","And, and that happens because people’s expectations about future inflation move up.","Q&A","Press Conf","","12","2021-07"
"2021-07-28","So you’re going to be in a process where inflation, the inflation process, gets going.","Q&A","Press Conf","","15","2021-07"
"2021-07-28","So to the extent people are, are, are implementing price increases because raw materials are going up or labor costs or something’s going up, you know, the question, really, for inflation really is, does that mean they’re going to go up the next year by the same amount?","Q&A","Press Conf","","48","2021-07"
"2021-07-28","And we don’t we have two mandates: maximum employment and price stability.","Q&A","Press Conf","","12","2021-07"
"2021-07-28","And that really is if what we call “unit labor costs” move up and, and, and, which really puts—move up in a way that is—that is hard for companies to manage and puts them in a situation where they have to accept substantially lower margins or raise prices.","Q&A","Press Conf","","48","2021-07"
"2021-07-28","That was the kind of inflation we were thinking about that comes from, you know, from a very, very strong labor market and a—and a booming that we’re seeing.","Q&A","Press Conf","","29","2021-07"

"2021-07-28","So inflation is running well above our 2 percent objective and has been for a few months and is expected to run up certainly above our objective for a few months before we believe it’ll, it’ll move back down toward our objective.","Q&A","Press Conf","","42","2021-07"
"2021-07-28","We have a very adaptive, adaptable, flexible economy and labor market.","Q&A","Press Conf","","11","2021-07"

"2021-07-28","So I, I, I don’t see in any of that that there is really anything that challenges the What we said was that, in particular, when we see a very strong labor market, high levels of employment, low levels of unemployment, that won’t be enough for us to raise interest rates until we see some inflation.","Q&A","Press Conf","","56","2021-07"
"2021-07-28","There was also some decline in inflation compensation, which has significantly reversed.","Q&A","Press Conf","","12","2021-07"

"2021-12-15","And inflation is well above target.","Q&A","Press Conf","","6","2021-12"
"2021-12-15","So you—it could well have been that this cycle was different because of the short nature of it and the very strong—the number of job openings, for example, you would have thought that that would have pulled people back in.","Q&A","Press Conf","","40","2021-12"
"2021-12-15","And, in fact, that’s, that’s been the pattern in past cycles—that labor force participation has tended to recover in the wake of a strong recovery in unemployment, which is what we’re getting right now.","Q&A","Press Conf","","34","2021-12"

"2021-12-15","We are attentive to the risks that persistent real wage growth in excess of productivity [growth] could put projection of FOMC participants falls from 5.3 percent this year to 2.6 percent next year; this trajectory is notably higher than projected in September.","Opening Statement","Press Conf","","42","2021-12"

"2021-12-15","I, I think—well, whether or not we— whether or not we say “we’re at conditions—labor market conditions consistent with, with maximum employment” next year, we would all be open and I think expect, over time, that the level of maximum employment that’s consistent with price stability would increase further over time—for example, through increasing participation.","Q&A","Press Conf","","55","2021-12"
"2021-12-15","But we’d have to—you know, we look at our two goals, maximum employment and price stability, and we make policy based on them, and not with respect to what we wrote down in a prior","Q&A","Press Conf","","35","2021-12"

"2021-12-15","You know, the ratio of job openings, for example, to, to vacancies is at all-time highs.","Q&A","Press Conf","","16","2021-12"

"2021-12-15","So I—we would certainly—we would not, in any way, want to foreclose the idea that the labor market can get even better.","Q&A","Press Conf","","22","2021-12"
"2021-12-15","Certainly, we had five months of declining month on month—monthly readings of inflation, but we didn’t see much in the way of progress on labor supply or on other supply-side issues.","Q&A","Press Conf","","31","2021-12"
"2021-12-15","Then in September, I’d say after Labor Day, we started to see—it started to become clear that this was both larger in its effect on inflation and more persistent.","Q&A","Press Conf","","29","2021-12"
"2021-12-15","But with the kind of hot labor market readings— wages we’re seeing, it’s something that we’re—that we’re watching.","Q&A","Press Conf","","18","2021-12"
"2021-12-15","As you look forward, let’s assume that the goods economy does sort itself out, and supply chains get particular—we don’t see this yet, but if you had something where wages were persistently— [increases in] real wages were persistently above productivity growth, that puts upward pressure on, on firms, and they raise prices.","Q&A","Press Conf","","52","2021-12"

"2021-12-15","It is not clear how big the effects would be on either inflation or growth or hiring on top of what’s already going on, which is quite a strong, you know, wave of Delta that’s hitting large parts of the country across the northern United States and all the way to the eastern seaboard and now coming down.","Q&A","Press Conf","","58","2021-12"

"2022-01-26","And that would be—that’s sort of a downside risk from a growth standpoint.","Q&A","Press Conf","","13","2022-01"

"2022-03-16","As I—it’s clearly time to raise interest rates and begin the balance sheet shrinkage.","Q&A","Press Conf","","14","2022-03"

"2022-03-16","Tremendous momentum in the labor market.","Q&A","Press Conf","","6","2022-03"
"2022-03-16","But if you look at where I read the SEP headline median, we still expect inflation to be high this year, lower than last year, and then we expect—though, particularly with the effects of the war, but also the data we’ve seen so far this year—we expect inflation to remain high through the middle of the year, begin to come down, and then come down more sharply next year.","Q&A","Press Conf","","69","2022-03"
"2022-03-16","So I guess I would say that the expectation is still that inflation will begin to come down in the second half of the year.","Q&A","Press Conf","","25","2022-03"
"2022-03-16","So now we’re, you know, we’re getting—we’re going—we’re already seeing a little bit of short- term upward pressure in inflation due to higher oil prices, natural gas [prices] a little bit but not so much for us since we have our own natural gas supply, other commodities prices.","Q&A","Press Conf","","48","2022-03"
"2022-03-16","I would have said that the expectation was that inflation would peak sometime in the first quarter, maybe the end of the first quarter of this year, and then maybe stay at that level or a little bit lower and then start to come down in the back half of the year.","Q&A","Press Conf","","52","2022-03"

"2022-03-16","But right now, they’re all showing the same thing, which is that the increases—not the levels, but the increases—are running at levels that are well above what would be consistent with 2 percent inflation, our goal, over time.","Q&A","Press Conf","","38","2022-03"

"2022-03-16","But it comes back to, you know, what I’m saying here—which is, there’s a misalignment of demand and supply, guide inflation back down to 2 percent.","Q&A","Press Conf","","26","2022-03"

"2022-03-16","We’re not going to let high inflation become entrenched.","Q&A","Press Conf","","9","2022-03"

"2022-03-16","But it’s really, especially, on people who use most of their income to buy essentials like food, housing, and transportation, where—I mean, we’ve all seen charts that show, if you’re a middle-income person, you’ve got room to absorb some inflation.","Q&A","Press Conf","","40","2022-03"
"2022-03-16","If you’re at the lower end of the income spectrum, it’s very hard because you’re spending most of your money already on necessities, and the price is going up.","Q&A","Press Conf","","29","2022-03"

"2022-03-16","So the way that works, I would explain, is, as we raise interest rates, that should gradually slow down demand for the interest-sensitive parts of the economy.","Q&A","Press Conf","","27","2022-03"
"2022-03-16","And so what we would see is demand slowing down, but just enough so that it’s better matched with supply.","Q&A","Press Conf","","20","2022-03"

"2022-03-16","And so financial conditions will become, at the margin, less supportive of various kinds of economic activity.","Q&A","Press Conf","","17","2022-03"

"2022-03-16","And, of course, when we tighten monetary policy, we do expect that they will adjust in sync over time with monetary policy.","Q&A","Press Conf","","22","2022-03"
"2022-03-16","And, yes, that will lead to some tightening in financial conditions in the form of higher interest rates and just the sorts of things—we’re not targeting any one or more of those things, but financial conditions generally should move to a more normal level so that—because we know the economy no longer needs, or wants, these very highly accommodative, this stance, which, you know, so it’s time to move to a more normal setting of financial conditions, and we do that by moving monetary policy itself to more normal levels.","Q&A","Press Conf","","90","2022-03"
"2022-03-16","And remember that the financial conditions we had for the last couple of years were a function not only of very aggressive, and appropriately so, fiscal policy, but also highly accommodative monetary policy—the monetary policy settings that we put in place at the worst parts of the pandemic.","Q&A","Press Conf","","48","2022-03"
"2022-03-16","There was no sense in which, if we got a burst of really high inflation, we would wait to raise rates.","Q&A","Press Conf","","21","2022-03"
"2022-03-16","And, as you can see, it is appropriate in the sense that, [in] people’s [contributions to the] SEPs, they do write down levels of interest rates that are above their estimate of the longer-run neutral rate.","Q&A","Press Conf","","36","2022-03"
"2022-03-16","We feel like the economy can handle tighter monetary policy.","Q&A","Press Conf","","10","2022-03"

"2022-03-21","The Labor Market Is Very Strong and Extremely TightTo begin with employment, in the last few years of the historically long expansion that ended with the arrival of the pandemic, we saw the remarkable benefits of an extended period of strong labor market conditions.","General","Speech","N/A","44","2022-03"
"2022-03-21","The labor market has substantial momentum.","General","Speech","N/A","6","2022-03"
"2022-03-21","Employment growth powered through the difficult Omicron wave, adding 1.75 million jobs over the past three months.","General","Speech","N/A","17","2022-03"
"2022-03-21","The unemployment rate has fallen to 3.8 percent, near historical lows, and has reached this level much faster than anticipated by most forecasters (figure 1).","General","Speech","N/A","25","2022-03"
"2022-03-21","While disparities in employment remain, job growth has been widespread across racial, ethnic, and demographic groups.","General","Speech","N/A","16","2022-03"
"2022-03-21","By many measures, the labor market is extremely tight, significantly tighter than the very strong job market just before the pandemic.","General","Speech","N/A","21","2022-03"
"2022-03-21","There are far more job openings going unfilled today than before the pandemic, despite today's unemployment rate being higher.","General","Speech","N/A","19","2022-03"
"2022-03-21","Indeed, there are a record 1.7 posted job openings for each person who is looking for work.","General","Speech","N/A","17","2022-03"
"2022-03-21","Record numbers of people are quitting jobs each month, typically to take another job with higher pay.","General","Speech","N/A","17","2022-03"
"2022-03-21","One explanation is that the natural rate of unemployment may be temporarily elevated, so wage pressure is greater for any given level of unemployment.","General","Speech","N/A","24","2022-03"
"2022-03-21","Prices soared across the vehicles sector as booming demand was met by a sharpdeclinein global production during the summer of 2021, owing to shortages of computer chips.","General","Speech","N/A","27","2022-03"
"2022-03-21","Many forecasters, including FOMC participants, had been expecting inflation to cool in the second half of last year, as the economy started going back to normal after vaccines became widely available.3Expectations were that the supply-side damage would begin to heal.","General","Speech","N/A","40","2022-03"
"2022-03-21","And monetary policy is often said to be a blunt instrument, not capable of surgical precision.","General","Speech","N/A","16","2022-03"
"2022-03-21","It is worth noting that today the economy is very strong and is well positioned to handle tighter monetary policy.","General","Speech","N/A","20","2022-03"
"2022-03-21","Finally, what will it take to restore price stability?The ultimate responsibility for price stability rests with the Federal Reserve.","General","Speech","N/A","19","2022-03"
"2022-03-21","Price stability is essential if we are going to have another sustained period of strong labor market conditions.","General","Speech","N/A","18","2022-03"

"2022-03-21","Our monetary policy framework, as embodied in our Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, emphasizes that having longer-term inflation expectations anchored at our longer-run objective of 2 percent helps us achieve both our dual-mandate objectives.","General","Speech","N/A","37","2022-03"
"2022-03-21","While we cannot measure longer-term expectations directly, we monitor a variety of survey- and market-based indicators.","General","Speech","N/A","16","2022-03"
"2022-03-21","In the recent period, short-term inflation expectations have, of course, risen with inflation, but longer-run expectations remain well anchored in their historical ranges (figure 7).","General","Speech","N/A","25","2022-03"
"2022-03-21","The added near-term upward pressure from the invasion of Ukraine on inflation from energy, food, and other commodities comes at a time of already too high inflation.","General","Speech","N/A","27","2022-03"
"2022-03-21","In normal times, when employment and inflation are close to our objectives, monetary policy would look through a brief burst of inflation associated with commodity price shocks.","General","Speech","N/A","27","2022-03"
"2022-03-21","However, the risk is rising that an extended period of high inflation could push longer-term expectations uncomfortably higher, which underscores the need for the Committee to move expeditiously as I have described.","General","Speech","N/A","32","2022-03"
"2022-03-21","Two years ago, more than 20 million people were losing their jobs, millions were falling ill, and lives were being disrupted.","General","Speech","N/A","21","2022-03"
"2022-03-21","Today, as I have discussed, the labor market is very strong.","General","Speech","N/A","11","2022-03"
"2022-03-21","But, to end where I began, inflation is much too high.","General","Speech","N/A","11","2022-03"

"2022-03-21","I believe that the historical record provides some grounds for optimism: Soft, or at least soft-ish, landings have been relatively common in U.S. monetary history.5In three episodes—in 1965, 1984, and 1994—the Fed raised the federal funds rate significantly in response to perceived overheating without precipitating a recession (figure 6).6In other cases, recessions chronologically followed the conclusion of a tightening cycle, but the recessions were not apparently due to excessive tightening of monetary policy.","General","Speech","N/A","73","2022-03"
"2022-03-21","Growth slows as the very fast growth from the early stages of reopening fades, the effects of fiscal support wane, and monetary policy accommodation is removed.","General","Speech","N/A","26","2022-03"
"2022-03-21","Second, how likely is it that monetary policy can lower inflation without causing a recession?Our goal is to restore price stability while fostering another long expansion and sustaining a strong labor market.In the FOMC participant projections I just described, the economy achieves a soft landing, with inflation coming down and unemployment holding steady.","General","Speech","N/A","53","2022-03"
"2022-03-21","Schools would reopen—freeing parents to return to work—and labor supply would begin bouncing back, kinks in supply chains would begin resolving, and consumption would start rotating back to services, all of which could reduce price pressures.","General","Speech","N/A","36","2022-03"
"2022-03-21","The Policy ResponseAs the magnitude and persistence of the increase in inflation became increasingly clear over the second half of last year, and as the job market recovery accelerated beyond expectations, the FOMC pivoted to progressively less accommodative monetary policy.","General","Speech","N/A","40","2022-03"
"2022-03-21","I believe that these policy actions and those to come will help bring inflation down near 2 percent over the next 3 years.","General","Speech","N/A","23","2022-03"
"2022-03-21","Production remains below pre-pandemic levels, and an expected sharp decline in prices has been repeatedly postponed.","General","Speech","N/A","16","2022-03"
"2022-03-21","Thus, my main message today is that, as the outlook evolves, we will adjust policy as needed in order to ensure a return to price stability with a strong job market.","General","Speech","N/A","31","2022-03"

"2022-03-21","In addition to the direct effects from higher global oil and commodity prices, the invasion and related events are likely to restrain economic activity abroad and further disrupt supply chains, which would create spillovers to the U.S. economy.","General","Speech","N/A","38","2022-03"
"2022-03-21","We might look to the historical experience with oil price shocks in the 1970s—not a happy story.","General","Speech","N/A","17","2022-03"
"2022-03-21","Fortunately, the United States is now much better situated to weather oil price shocks.4We are now the world's largest producer of oil, and our economy is significantly less oil intensive than in the 1970s.","General","Speech","N/A","34","2022-03"
"2022-03-21","Today a rise in oil prices has mixed effects on the economy, lowering real household incomes and thus demand, but raising investment in drilling over time and benefiting oil-producing areas more generally.","General","Speech","N/A","32","2022-03"

"2022-05-04","Anyway, we got an ECI reading—employment compensation, [employment cost] index reading—the Friday before the November meeting.","Q&A","Press Conf","","16","2022-05"
"2022-05-04","Then we got a really strong jobs report.","Q&A","Press Conf","","8","2022-05"
"2022-05-04","But, you know, the big pain over time is in not dealing with inflation and allowing it to become entrenched.","Q&A","Press Conf","","20","2022-05"
"2022-05-04","So unemployment rates for all racial groups have come down a lot and are now much closer to where they were before the pandemic hit.","Q&A","Press Conf","","25","2022-05"
"2022-05-04","I don’t, because you can see that the labor market is out of balance.","Q&A","Press Conf","","14","2022-05"
"2022-05-04","But, ultimately, getting those, getting supply and demand back, you know, back in balance, is what gives us 2 percent inflation, which is what gives the economy a footing where people can lead successful economic lives and not worry about inflation.","Q&A","Press Conf","","41","2022-05"
"2022-05-04","And, you know, our strategy is to set up a plan and have it operate and really have, you know, have the interest rate be the active tool of monetary policy.","Q&A","Press Conf","","31","2022-05"
"2022-05-04","In terms of speaking to the American people, so I feel like sometimes I just want to remind us, really, that that’s who we work for, and that it’s inflation that people are feeling all over the country.","Q&A","Press Conf","","38","2022-05"
"2022-05-04","And a good example of why would be—in the fourth quarter of last year, as we started talking about tapering sooner and then raising rates this year, you saw financial markets reacting, you know, very appropriately.","Q&A","Press Conf","","36","2022-05"
"2022-05-04","Not to bless any particular day’s measure, but the way financial markets, the forward rate curve has tightened in response to our guidance and our actions really amplifies our policy.","Q&A","Press Conf","","30","2022-05"
"2022-05-04","It’s—monetary policy is working through expectations now, to a very large extent.","Q&A","Press Conf","","12","2022-05"
"2022-05-04","And so that shows that the markets think that our forward guidance is credible.","Q&A","Press Conf","","14","2022-05"
"2022-05-04","Well, so, as I mentioned, you can see places where the demand is substantially in excess of supply.","Q&A","Press Conf","","18","2022-05"
"2022-05-04","And what you’re seeing as a result of that is prices going up and at unsustainable levels, levels that are not consistent with 2 percent inflation.","Q&A","Press Conf","","26","2022-05"
"2022-05-04","And so what our tools do is that as we raise interest rates, demand moderates: it moves down.","Q&A","Press Conf","","18","2022-05"
"2022-05-04","Interest rates, you know—businesses will invest a little bit less, consumers will spend a little bit less.","Q&A","Press Conf","","17","2022-05"
"2022-05-04","There aren’t enough people to fill these job openings.","Q&A","Press Conf","","9","2022-05"

"2022-05-04","GDP growth was then expected to slow in 2023 and 2024 as monetary policy became less accommodative and financial conditions tightened further; by 2024, real GDP growth was expected to be in line with potential output growth.","Staff Economic Outlook","Minutes","N/A","37","2022-05"

"2022-05-04","The staff noted that the first-quarter decline in real GDP was driven by categories of spending that had often been volatile in the past, and they viewed the continued strength in private domestic final demand, the labor market, and industrial production as providing a more accurate picture of the economy's direction in the first quarter.","Staff Economic Outlook","Minutes","N/A","55","2022-05"

"2022-05-04","There’s no specific number that we’re saying, “We’ve got to get to that.” matching functions in the labor markets are working.","Q&A","Press Conf","","21","2022-05"
"2022-05-04","And it’s a great thing, but you want them to go up at a sustainable level, because these wages are, to some extent, being eaten up by inflation.","Q&A","Press Conf","","28","2022-05"
"2022-05-04","So, what that really means is, to get the kind of labor market we really want to get, we really want to have a labor market that serves all Americans, especially the people in the lower-income part of the distribution, especially them.","Q&A","Press Conf","","42","2022-05"
"2022-05-04","To do that, you’ve got to have price stability.","Q&A","Press Conf","","9","2022-05"
"2022-05-04","And we’ve got to get back to price stability so that we can have a labor market where people’s wages aren’t being eaten up by inflation and where we can have a long expansion, too.","Q&A","Press Conf","","35","2022-05"

"2022-05-04","Okay, so in terms of the vacancies-to-unemployment ratio, we don’t have a goal in mind.","Q&A","Press Conf","","15","2022-05"
"2022-05-04","I see a very strong labor market, for example.","Q&A","Press Conf","","9","2022-05"
"2022-05-04","We have, essentially, interest rates, the balance sheet, and forward guidance, and they’re famously blunt tools.","Q&A","Press Conf","","16","2022-05"
"2022-05-04","And, you know, our job is not to rate the chances—it is to try to achieve it.","Q&A","Press Conf","","17","2022-05"
"2022-05-04","You know, it’s really the Fed that has responsibility for price stability.","Q&A","Press Conf","","12","2022-05"
"2022-05-04","And we take whatever arrives at the Fed in terms of fiscal activity, we take it as a given, and we don’t evaluate it—it’s not our job, really.","Q&A","Press Conf","","28","2022-05"

"2022-05-04","And while it’s certainly not your desire—the soft landing is the big hope of everyone— would this FOMC have the courage to endure recessions to bring inflation down if that were the only way necessary?","Q&A","Press Conf","","35","2022-05"

"2022-05-04","And it’s our job to make sure that inflation of that unpleasant, high nature doesn’t get entrenched in the economy.","Q&A","Press Conf","","20","2022-05"
"2022-05-04","And the way we do that is, we try to get supply and demand back in sync with each other, back in balance, so that the economy is under less stress and inflation will go down.","Q&A","Press Conf","","36","2022-05"
"2022-05-04","Everyone— particularly people on fixed incomes and at the lower part of the income distribution are better off with stable prices.","Q&A","Press Conf","","21","2022-05"
"2022-05-04","And so we need to do everything we can to restore stable prices.","Q&A","Press Conf","","13","2022-05"

"2022-05-04","As I mentioned, growth [was] over 5 percent.","Q&A","Press Conf","","8","2022-05"

"2022-05-04","And that will, of course, tend to hold the unemployment rate up a little bit.","Q&A","Press Conf","","15","2022-05"
"2022-05-04","I would also expect, though, that job creation will slow.","Q&A","Press Conf","","10","2022-05"
"2022-05-04","Job creation has been, you know, more than half a million per month in recent months—very, very strong, particularly for this stage of the economy.","Q&A","Press Conf","","25","2022-05"
"2022-05-04","And so we think— with fiscal policy less supportive, with monetary policy less supportive, we think that job creation will slow as well.","Q&A","Press Conf","","23","2022-05"
"2022-05-04","So it is certainly possible that the unemployment would go down further.","Q&A","Press Conf","","12","2022-05"
"2022-05-04","But so I would expect those to be relatively limited because of the additional supply and also just the slowing in job creation.","Q&A","Press Conf","","23","2022-05"

"2022-05-04","And that’s because of an imbalance between supply and demand in the labor market.","Q&A","Press Conf","","14","2022-05"
"2022-05-04","So we think through our policies—through further healing in the labor market, higher rates, for example, of vacancy filling and things like that, and more people coming back in—we’d like to think that supply and demand will come back into balance and that, therefore, wage inflation will moderate to still","Q&A","Press Conf","","50","2022-05"
"2022-05-04","There’s a path by which we would be able to have demand moderate in the labor market and therefore have vacancies come down without unemployment going up, because vacancies are at such an extraordinarily high level.","Q&A","Press Conf","","36","2022-05"
"2022-05-04","So, in principle, it seems as though by moderating demand, we could see vacancies come down and, as a result—and they could come down fairly significantly and, I think, put supply and demand at least closer together than they are.","Q&A","Press Conf","","40","2022-05"

"2022-06-15","So, of course, we’ve been looking very carefully and hard at why inflation picked up so much more than expected last year and why it proved so persistent.","Q&A","Press Conf","","28","2022-06"
"2022-06-15","So we have now experienced an extraordinary series of shocks, if you think about it: the pandemic, the response, the reopening, inflation, followed by the war in Ukraine, followed by shutdowns in China—the war in Ukraine potentially having effects for years here.","Q&A","Press Conf","","42","2022-06"
"2022-06-15","For—really, the context is this: For decades before the pandemic and the reopening, you had a world where inflation was dominated by disinflationary forces such as declining population or aging demographics, let’s call it that, globalization enabled by technology, other factors, low productivity.","Q&A","Press Conf","","43","2022-06"
"2022-06-15","So we just don’t know, but we’re focused on—very, very focused on getting inflation back down to 2 percent, which we think is essential for the benefit of the public and also to put us on a path back to a sustainably strong labor market like the one we had before the pandemic.","Q&A","Press Conf","","53","2022-06"
"2022-06-15","And, again, the answer to the question, can we still do it—there’s a much bigger chance now that it’ll depend on factors that we don’t control, which is, fluctuations and spikes in commodity prices could wind up taking that option out of our hands.","Q&A","Press Conf","","44","2022-06"
"2022-06-15","Inflation is behaving differently, and, in our thinking, it really is a question of very strong demand.","Q&A","Press Conf","","17","2022-06"
"2022-06-15","So prices may keep going up for a while even in a world where rates are up.","Q&A","Press Conf","","17","2022-06"
"2022-06-15","So it’s still a very tight market.","Q&A","Press Conf","","7","2022-06"
"2022-06-15","You would think over time—I mean, so there’s a tremendous amount of supply in the housing market of unfinished homes, and as those come on line—whereas the supply of finished homes, inventory of finished homes that are for sale, is incredibly low, historically low.","Q&A","Press Conf","","44","2022-06"
"2022-06-15","How much will it affect housing prices?","Q&A","Press Conf","","7","2022-06"
"2022-06-15","So that changes now, and rates have moved up—we’re well aware that mortgage rates have moved up a lot—and you’re seeing a changing housing market.","Q&A","Press Conf","","25","2022-06"
"2022-06-15","And we saw prices moving up very, very strongly for the last couple of years.","Q&A","Press Conf","","15","2022-06"
"2022-06-15","And so the demand was just suddenly much higher.","Q&A","Press Conf","","9","2022-06"
"2022-06-15","So, in the meantime, while rates were low and while demand was really high, obviously demand for housing changed from wanting to live in urban areas to some extent to living in single-family homes in the suburbs, famously.","Q&A","Press Conf","","38","2022-06"
"2022-06-15","But you couldn’t get this kind of inflation without a change on the supply side, which is there for anybody to see, which is these blockages and shortages and people dropping out of the labor force and things like that.","Q&A","Press Conf","","40","2022-06"
"2022-06-15","We’re phasing in—Treasury [security] issuance is down quite a lot, quite a lot from where it’s been, so I have no reason to think—markets are forward looking, and they see this coming.","Q&A","Press Conf","","32","2022-06"
"2022-06-15","Markets seem to be okay with it.","Q&A","Press Conf","","7","2022-06"
"2022-06-15","We’ve done a lot of introspection and work on that and—sorry, on QT, we’ve communicated really clearly to the markets about what we’re going to do there.","Q&A","Press Conf","","27","2022-06"
"2022-06-15","In fact, we’re sort of in the middle of the pack, although I think we have, of course, a different kind of inflation than other people have, partly because our economy is stronger and more highly recovered.","Q&A","Press Conf","","37","2022-06"
"2022-06-15","Again, if you look around the world at where inflation levels are, it’s absolutely extraordinary.","Q&A","Press Conf","","15","2022-06"
"2022-06-15","In the meantime, we have to find price stability in this new world and maximum employment in this new world where, clearly, inflationary forces are—you’re seeing them everywhere.","Q&A","Press Conf","","28","2022-06"
"2022-06-15","If you see—you’re looking at getting back down to almost a 2 percent inflation by 2024, and the unemployment rate is still as low as 4.1 percent.","Q&A","Press Conf","","27","2022-06"
"2022-06-15","Wages are not principally responsible for the inflation that we’re seeing, but, going forward, they would be very important, particularly in the service sector.","Q&A","Press Conf","","24","2022-06"
"2022-06-15","And we’ll be able to see—the areas that we can affect are those associated with excess demand, and we’ll be able to see our effect on, for example, job openings in real time.","Q&A","Press Conf","","33","2022-06"
"2022-06-15","So I think the role that we can play—maybe the way to get at this is to say that the role that we can play is around demand, right?","Q&A","Press Conf","","29","2022-06"
"2022-06-15","So it’s a very difficult situation to be in, and we— again, we can’t do much about the difference between [headline and core inflation rates due to] the elements that make up headline that are not in core.","Q&A","Press Conf","","38","2022-06"
"2022-06-15","But we have to be mindful of the potential effect on inflation expectations [coming] from headline [inflation readings].","Q&A","Press Conf","","18","2022-06"
"2022-06-15","And most of food—not all of it, but most food prices are pretty heavily influenced by global commodity prices, too.","Q&A","Press Conf","","20","2022-06"
"2022-06-15","We can’t affect, really—I mean, the energy prices are set by global commodity prices.","Q&A","Press Conf","","14","2022-06"
"2022-06-15","We, of course, like all central banks do, look very, very carefully at core inflation because it is—it’s a much better predictor, and it’s much—it’s a much better predictor of where inflation is going, and it’s also more relevant to our tools.","Q&A","Press Conf","","42","2022-06"
"2022-06-15","And inflation means headline inflation.","Q&A","Press Conf","","5","2022-06"
"2022-06-15","So the—we’re responsible for inflation in the law.","Q&A","Press Conf","","8","2022-06"
"2022-06-15","We have to restore price stability.","Q&A","Press Conf","","6","2022-06"
"2022-06-15","Some of that will be pass- through of energy prices, but it’s—so you’re experiencing services inflation.","Q&A","Press Conf","","16","2022-06"
"2022-06-15","So, as I mentioned, I think, in my opening statement, inflation has started—it started off in quite narrow, very directly pandemic-related areas, and it’s spread now broadly across the economy and into the services sector as well.","Q&A","Press Conf","","37","2022-06"
"2022-06-15","It will take some time, we think, to get inflation back down, but we will do that.","Q&A","Press Conf","","17","2022-06"
"2022-06-15","I guess what I’m saying is, the question, the really critical question from the perspective of doing our job is making sure that the public does have confidence that we have the tools and will use them and they do work to bring inflation back down over time.","Q&A","Press Conf","","48","2022-06"
"2022-06-15","And many people are experiencing it, really, for the first time, because we haven’t had anything like this kind of inflation in 40 years.","Q&A","Press Conf","","24","2022-06"
"2022-06-15","So, clearly, people don’t like inflation—a lot.","Q&A","Press Conf","","7","2022-06"
"2022-06-15","We think that the public generally sees us as very likely to be successful in getting inflation down to 2 percent, and that’s critical.","Q&A","Press Conf","","24","2022-06"
"2022-06-15","We don’t think that we’re seeing a wage–price spiral.","Q&A","Press Conf","","9","2022-06"
"2022-06-15","This inflation happened relatively recently.","Q&A","Press Conf","","5","2022-06"
"2022-06-15","So we want to get the job done.","Q&A","Press Conf","","8","2022-06"
"2022-06-15","If you don’t have price stability, the economy’s really not going to work the way it’s supposed to.","Q&A","Press Conf","","18","2022-06"
"2022-06-15","And they’re experiencing that, determined to do what we can to get inflation back down.","Q&A","Press Conf","","15","2022-06"
"2022-06-15","I will begin with one overarching message: We at the Fed understand the hardship that high inflation is causing.","Opening Statement","Press Conf","","19","2022-06"
"2022-06-15","So, what we want to see is a series of declining monthly readings for inflation, and we’d like to see inflation headed down.","Q&A","Press Conf","","23","2022-06"
"2022-06-15","So that’s the kind of thinking we’ll be doing, and, again, we’re looking—ultimately, we’re not going to declare victory until we see a series of these, really see convincing evidence, compelling evidence, that inflation is coming down.","Q&A","Press Conf","","37","2022-06"
"2022-06-15","Again, I think that—I do think that our objective, and this is what’s reflected in the SEP, but our objective, really, is to bring inflation down to 2 percent while the labor market remains strong.","Q&A","Press Conf","","35","2022-06"
"2022-06-15","And there I’m thinking, of course, of commodity prices, the war in Ukraine, supply chain getting more challenging because of these external forces—and that path is to move demand down, and you have a lot of surplus demand.","Q&A","Press Conf","","38","2022-06"
"2022-06-15","Take, for example, in the labor market.","Q&A","Press Conf","","7","2022-06"
"2022-06-15","So you have two job vacancies, essentially, for every person actively seeking a job, and that has led to a real imbalance in wage negotiating.","Q&A","Press Conf","","25","2022-06"
"2022-06-15","You could get to a place where that ratio was at a more normal level, and you wouldn’t—you would expect to see those wage pressures move back down to a level where people are still getting healthy wage increases, real wage increases, but at a level that’s consistent with 2 percent inflation.","Q&A","Press Conf","","52","2022-06"
"2022-06-15","And you could say the same thing about some of the product markets where there’s just excess capacity and really where the strong demand has gone into—sorry, where they’re capacity constrained, right?","Q&A","Press Conf","","32","2022-06"
"2022-06-15","And that’s what I mean by—that’s what it would take for us to say, “Okay, we think this job is done.” Because we saw—and, frankly, we saw last year—inflation came down over the course of the summer and then turned right around and went back up.","Q&A","Press Conf","","46","2022-06"
"2022-06-15","We want to see—inflation can’t go down until it flattens out, and that’s what we’re looking to see.","Q&A","Press Conf","","18","2022-06"
"2022-06-15","But I’m wondering, on the inflation expectations data, was there something you saw that was unsettling enough to risk eroding the credibility of your verbal guidance by doing something so different from what you had “socialized” before?","Q&A","Press Conf","","37","2022-06"
"2022-06-15","So if you look at a broad range of inflation expectations—so you’ve got the public, you’ve got surveys of the public and of experts, and you’ve also got market based.","Q&A","Press Conf","","30","2022-06"
"2022-06-15","And I think if you look across that broad range of data, what you see is that expectations are still in the place, very much in the place, where short-term inflation is going to be high but comes down sharply over the next couple of years.","Q&A","Press Conf","","46","2022-06"
"2022-06-15","And that’s really where inflation expectations are.","Q&A","Press Conf","","7","2022-06"
"2022-06-15","We also noticed that the index of common inflation expectations at the Board has moved up after being pretty flat for a long time, so we’re watching that, and we’re thinking, “this is something we need to take seriously.” And that is one of the factors, as I mentioned—one of the factors in our deciding to move ahead with 75 basis points today was what we saw in inflation expectations.","Q&A","Press Conf","","70","2022-06"
"2022-06-15","Forty-year highs in inflation—we think that policy is going to need to be restrictive, and we don’t know how restrictive.","Q&A","Press Conf","","20","2022-06"
"2022-06-15","So, again, the overall exercise is that we try to be—provide as much clarity about our policy intentions as we can, because we think that makes monetary policy work better.","Q&A","Press Conf","","30","2022-06"
"2022-06-15","And, in this particular situation, you know, we’re looking for something specific, and that is progress on inflation.","Q&A","Press Conf","","18","2022-06"
"2022-06-15","So demand comes in, and it’s very strong, and it shows up in higher prices—not higher quantities, not more cars, because they can’t make the cars because they don’t have the semiconductors.","Q&A","Press Conf","","32","2022-06"
"2022-06-15","When demand comes down, you could see—and it’s not guaranteed—but you could see prices coming down more than the typical economic relationships that you see in the textbooks would suggest, because of the unusual situation we’re in on the supply side.","Q&A","Press Conf","","41","2022-06"
"2022-06-15","And you look around the world—I mean, lots of countries are—lots of countries are looking at inflation of 10 percent, and it’s largely due to commodities prices.","Q&A","Press Conf","","27","2022-06"
"2022-06-15","And so—and we’re seeing them here: gas prices at all-time highs, and things like that.","Q&A","Press Conf","","15","2022-06"
"2022-06-15","So that is really—and, by the way, headline inflation, headline inflation is important for expectations.","Q&A","Press Conf","","15","2022-06"
"2022-06-15","People—the public’s expectations, why would they be distinguishing between core inflation and headline inflation?","Q&A","Press Conf","","14","2022-06"
"2022-06-15","Core inflation is something we [on the Committee] think about because it is a better predictor of future inflation.","Q&A","Press Conf","","19","2022-06"
"2022-06-15","But headline inflation is what people experience.","Q&A","Press Conf","","7","2022-06"
"2022-06-15","So that’s—expectations are very much at risk due to high headline inflation.","Q&A","Press Conf","","12","2022-06"
"2022-06-15","market by falling and then revisions to the previous months were down.","Q&A","Press Conf","","12","2022-06"
"2022-06-15","That’s probably related to gas prices and also just stock prices to some extent for other people.","Q&A","Press Conf","","17","2022-06"
"2022-06-15","And I know you just said that what changed was really the inflation data—the inflation expectations data.","Q&A","Press Conf","","17","2022-06"
"2022-06-15","And so much of it is really not down to monetary policy.","Q&A","Press Conf","","12","2022-06"
"2022-06-15","Again, thinking here of the fallout from the war in Ukraine, which has brought a spike in prices of energy, food, fertilizer, industrial chemicals, and also just the supply chains more broadly, which have been larger and longer lasting than anticipated.","Q&A","Press Conf","","41","2022-06"
"2022-06-15","In the SEP, we have unemployment going up to 4 point—the median is 4.1 percent—of course, [there is] a range of actual forecasts.","Q&A","Press Conf","","23","2022-06"
"2022-06-15","And I would characterize that, if you were to get inflation down to, you know, on its way down to 2 percent and the unemployment rate went up to 4.1 percent, that’s still a historically low level.","Q&A","Press Conf","","37","2022-06"

"2022-08-26","As former Chairman Paul Volcker put it at the height of the Great Inflation in 1979, ""Inflation feeds in part on itself, so part of the job of returning to a more stable and more productive economy must be to break the grip of inflationary expectations.","General","Speech","N/A","46","2022-08"

"2022-09-21","So that’s a slower, that’s a very slow level of growth, and it could give rise to increases in unemployment.","Q&A","Press Conf","","20","2022-09"
"2022-09-21","But I think that’s, so that is something that we think we need to have, and we think we need to have softer labor market conditions as well.","Q&A","Press Conf","","28","2022-09"
"2022-09-21","So that’s what we’re hearing from people is, you know, very much—that inflation is really hurting.","Q&A","Press Conf","","16","2022-09"
"2022-09-21","So that’s very slow growth.","Q&A","Press Conf","","5","2022-09"
"2022-09-21","We’re never going to say that there are too many people working, but the real point is this: Inflation—what we hear from people when we meet with them is that they really are suffering from inflation.","Q&A","Press Conf","","36","2022-09"
"2022-09-21","So the median forecast, I think, this year among my colleagues and me was 0.2 percent growth.","Q&A","Press Conf","","17","2022-09"
"2022-09-21","And if we want to set ourselves up, really light the way to another period of a very strong labor market, we have got to get inflation behind us.","Q&A","Press Conf","","29","2022-09"
"2022-09-21","So if your family is one where you spend most of your paycheck, every paycheck cycle, on gas, food, transportation, clothing, basics of life, and prices go up the way they’ve been going up, you’re in trouble right away.","Q&A","Press Conf","","39","2022-09"
"2022-09-21","So, what we need to do is get rates up to the point where we’re putting meaningful downward pressure on inflation, and that’s what we’re doing.","Q&A","Press Conf","","26","2022-09"
"2022-09-21","And we certainly don’t hope, we certainly haven’t given up the idea that we can have a relatively modest increase in unemployment.","Q&A","Press Conf","","22","2022-09"
"2022-09-21","So, for starters, people are seeing their wage increases eaten up by inflation.","Q&A","Press Conf","","13","2022-09"
"2022-09-21","I think that there’s a very high likelihood that we’ll have a period of what I’ve mentioned is below-trend growth, by which I mean much lower growth, and we’re seeing that now.","Q&A","Press Conf","","32","2022-09"
"2022-09-21","So how do we get rid of inflation?","Q&A","Press Conf","","8","2022-09"
"2022-09-21","We are in pretty regular contact, and we exchange, of course—we all serve a domestic mandate, domestic objectives—in our case, the dual mandate, maximum employment and price stability.","Q&A","Press Conf","","28","2022-09"
"2022-09-21","You’re right, of course—the labor market, in particular, has been very strong.","Q&A","Press Conf","","12","2022-09"
"2022-09-21","But there are—the sectors of the economy that are most interest rate sensitive are certainly showing the effects of our tightening, and, of course, the obvious example is housing, having an effect on exports and imports.","Q&A","Press Conf","","36","2022-09"
"2022-09-21","There’s still very significant savings out there, although not as much at the lower end of the income spectrum—but still, some savings out there to support growth.","Q&A","Press Conf","","27","2022-09"
"2022-09-21","Now, the data sort of are showing that growth is going to be below trend this year.","Q&A","Press Conf","","17","2022-09"
"2022-09-21","We’re forecasting growth well below that, and most forecasters are.","Q&A","Press Conf","","10","2022-09"
"2022-09-21","But you’re right—there’s certainly a possibility that growth can be stronger than that.","Q&A","Press Conf","","13","2022-09"
"2022-09-21","But, of course, we are focused on the thing I started with, which is getting inflation back down to 2 percent.","Q&A","Press Conf","","21","2022-09"
"2022-09-21","In all cases, you will get forward inflation expectations in the short term, I think, that are going to be, assuming that we’re doing our jobs appropriately, that will be significant.","Q&A","Press Conf","","31","2022-09"
"2022-09-21","Hopefully, we do that by slowing the economy, and we see some softening in labor market conditions, and we see a big contribution from supply-side improvements, and things like that.","Q&A","Press Conf","","30","2022-09"
"2022-09-21","Housing prices were going up at an unsustainably fast level.","Q&A","Press Conf","","10","2022-09"
"2022-09-21","So the deceleration in housing prices that we’re seeing should help bring sort of prices more closely in line with rents and other housing market fundamentals, and that’s a good thing.","Q&A","Press Conf","","31","2022-09"
"2022-09-21","For the longer term, what we need is supply and demand to get better aligned so that housing prices go up at a reasonable level—at a reasonable pace—and that people can afford houses again.","Q&A","Press Conf","","34","2022-09"
"2022-09-21","And I think we—so we probably, in the housing market, have to go through a correction to get back to that place.","Q&A","Press Conf","","22","2022-09"
"2022-09-21","There’s also, there are also longer-run issues, though, with the housing market.","Q&A","Press Conf","","12","2022-09"
"2022-09-21","But from a sort of business cycle standpoint, this difficult correction should put the housing market back into better balance.","Q&A","Press Conf","","20","2022-09"
"2022-09-21","I think that shelter inflation is going to remain high for some time.","Q&A","Press Conf","","13","2022-09"
"2022-09-21","So there was a big imbalance between supply and demand.","Q&A","Press Conf","","10","2022-09"
"2022-09-21","It will be enough to restore price stability.","Q&A","Press Conf","","8","2022-09"
"2022-09-21","What you’re going to do is, you’re going to adjust that for some forward-looking measure of inflation.","Q&A","Press Conf","","17","2022-09"
"2022-09-21","We have to get supply and demand back into alignment, and the way we do that is by slowing the economy.","Q&A","Press Conf","","21","2022-09"
"2022-09-21","What I’m really saying is that we’ve had a time of a red-hot housing market all over the country, where, famously, houses were selling to the first buyer at 10 percent above the ask, before even seeing the house.","Q&A","Press Conf","","39","2022-09"
"2022-09-21","We want to act aggressively now and get this job done and keep at it until it’s done.","Q&A","Press Conf","","18","2022-09"
"2022-09-21","The United States had 2 percent inflation, didn’t move around much, and that was enormously beneficial to the public that we serve.","Q&A","Press Conf","","22","2022-09"
"2022-09-21","So I think we’re moving to do what we need to do and do our jobs, and that’s what you see us doing.","Q&A","Press Conf","","23","2022-09"
"2022-09-21","I mean, it really depends on how long it takes for wages and, more than that, prices to come down for inflation to come down.","Q&A","Press Conf","","25","2022-09"
"2022-09-21","And so what you see in our projections today is that inflation moves down significantly over the course of next year and then more the next year after that.","Q&A","Press Conf","","29","2022-09"
"2022-09-21","And things will start to feel better to people—they’ll feel lower inflation, they’ll feel that the economy is improving.","Q&A","Press Conf","","19","2022-09"
"2022-09-21","We’ve had three of the four longest in measured what we saw in 2018, ’19, and ’20, which was very low unemployment, the biggest wage gains going to people at the low end of the spectrum, the smallest racial gaps that we’ve seen since we started keeping track of that.","Q&A","Press Conf","","50","2022-09"
"2022-09-21","But, to get there, we’re going to have to get supply and demand back in alignment, and that’s going to take tight monetary policy for a period of time.","Q&A","Press Conf","","29","2022-09"
"2022-09-21","Higher interest rates, slower growth, and a softening labor market are all painful for the public that we serve.","Q&A","Press Conf","","19","2022-09"
"2022-09-21","But they’re not as painful as failing to restore price stability and then having to come back and do it down the road again and doing it at a time when, actually, now people have really come to expect high inflation.","Q&A","Press Conf","","41","2022-09"
"2022-09-21","If the concept of high inflation becomes entrenched in people’s economic thinking about their decisions, then sort of getting back to price stability—the cost of getting back to price stability just rises, and so we want to avoid that.","Q&A","Press Conf","","39","2022-09"
"2022-09-21","And also, if our projections are close to right, you’ll see that the costs in unemployment are, they’re meaningful, and they’re certainly very meaningful to the people who lose their jobs.","Q&A","Press Conf","","31","2022-09"
"2022-09-21","We have always understood that restoring price stability while achieving a relatively modest decline—or, rather, increase—in unemployment and a soft landing would be very challenging.","Q&A","Press Conf","","25","2022-09"
"2022-09-21","So, of course, monetary policy does, famously, work with long and variable lags.","Q&A","Press Conf","","13","2022-09"
"2022-09-21","Then, changes in financial conditions begin to affect economic activity fairly quickly, within a few months.","Q&A","Press Conf","","16","2022-09"
"2022-09-21","But it’s likely to take some time to see the full effects of changing financial conditions on inflation.","Q&A","Press Conf","","18","2022-09"
"2022-09-21","And that’s why I noted in my opening remarks that, at some point, as the stance of policy tightens further, it will become appropriate to slow the pace of rate hikes while we assess how our cumulative policy adjustments are affecting the economy and inflation.","Q&A","Press Conf","","45","2022-09"
"2022-09-21","As I mentioned, what we think we need to do and should do is to move our policy rate to a restrictive level that’s restrictive enough to bring inflation down to 2 percent, where we have confidence of that.","Q&A","Press Conf","","39","2022-09"
"2022-09-21","So you’re right—in the SEP, there’s what I would characterize as a relatively modest increase in the unemployment rate from a historical perspective, given the expected decline in inflation.","Q&A","Press Conf","","29","2022-09"
"2022-09-21","First—and you know these—but first, job of an increase in unemployment as has happened in earlier historical episodes.","Q&A","Press Conf","","18","2022-09"
"2022-09-21","about how you factor in the variable lags on inflation and the extent to which the outlook for rates should be seen as linear in the sense that you keep raising rates?","Q&A","Press Conf","","32","2022-09"
"2022-09-21","In terms of reducing rates, I think we’d want to be very confident that inflation is moving back down to 2 percent before we would consider that.","Q&A","Press Conf","","27","2022-09"
"2022-09-21","My colleagues and I are strongly committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal.","Opening Statement","Press Conf","","17","2022-09"
"2022-09-21","We have both the tools we need and the resolve that it will take to restore price stability on behalf of American families and businesses.","Opening Statement","Press Conf","","25","2022-09"
"2022-09-21","Price stability is the responsibility of the Federal Reserve and serves as the bedrock of our economy.","Opening Statement","Press Conf","","17","2022-09"
"2022-09-21","Without price stability, the economy does not work for anyone.","Opening Statement","Press Conf","","10","2022-09"
"2022-09-21","In particular, without price stability, we will not achieve a sustained period of strong labor market conditions that benefit all.","Opening Statement","Press Conf","","20","2022-09"
"2022-09-21","Today the FOMC raised its policy interest rate by ¾ percentage point, and we anticipate that ongoing increases will be appropriate.","Opening Statement","Press Conf","","21","2022-09"
"2022-09-21","We are moving our policy stance purposefully to a level that will be sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2 percent.","Opening Statement","Press Conf","","21","2022-09"
"2022-09-21","I will have more to say about today’s monetary policy actions after briefly reviewing economic developments.","Opening Statement","Press Conf","","16","2022-09"
"2022-09-21","So the way we’re thinking about this is, the overarching focus of the Committee is getting inflation back down to 2 percent.","Q&A","Press Conf","","22","2022-09"
"2022-09-21","To accomplish that, we think we’ll need to do two things, in particular: to achieve a period of growth below trend; and also some softening in labor market conditions to foster a better balance between demand and supply in the labor market.","Q&A","Press Conf","","42","2022-09"
"2022-09-21","So on the first, the Committee’s forecasts and those of most outside forecasters do show growth running below its longer-run potential this year and next year.","Q&A","Press Conf","","26","2022-09"
"2022-09-21","On the second, though, so far there’s only modest evidence that the labor market is cooling off.","Q&A","Press Conf","","17","2022-09"
"2022-09-21","Job openings are down a bit, as you know; quits are off their all-time highs; there’s some signs that some wage measures may be flattening out but not moving up; payroll gains have moderated but not much.","Q&A","Press Conf","","37","2022-09"
"2022-09-21","And in light of the high inflation we’re seeing, we think we’ll need to—and in light of what I just said, we think that we’ll need to bring our funds rate to a restrictive level and to keep it there for some time.","Q&A","Press Conf","","43","2022-09"
"2022-09-21","First, we’ll want to see growth continuing to run below trend, we’ll want to see movements in the labor market showing a return to a better balance between supply and demand, and, ultimately, we’ll want to see clear evidence that inflation is moving back down to 2 percent.","Q&A","Press Conf","","48","2022-09"
"2022-09-21","The FOMC is strongly resolved to bring inflation down to 2 percent, and we will keep at it until the job is done.","Q&A","Press Conf","","23","2022-09"
"2022-09-21","If that’s the one thing you know, you know that this Committee is committed to getting to a meaningfully restrictive stance of policy and staying there until we feel confident that inflation is coming down.","Q&A","Press Conf","","35","2022-09"
"2022-09-21","In addition, in this cycle, longer-run inflation expectations have generally been fairly well anchored, and, as I’ve said, there’s no basis for complacency there.","Q&A","Press Conf","","24","2022-09"
"2022-09-21","And I guess the third thing I would point to that’s different this time is that part of this inflation is caused by this series of supply shocks that we’ve had, beginning with the pandemic, and, really, with the reopening of the economy, and more recently amplified and added to by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine—have all contributed to the sharp increase in inflation.","Q&A","Press Conf","","63","2022-09"
"2022-09-21","Is it lack of progress on inflation seen in the CPI reports?","Q&A","Press Conf","","12","2022-09"
"2022-09-21","Or is it a motivation to get as much done while the job market is still as strong as it is?","Q&A","Press Conf","","21","2022-09"
"2022-09-21","So, what we’ve seen is, inflation has—our expectation has been that we would begin to see inflation come down, largely because of supply-side healing.","Q&A","Press Conf","","24","2022-09"
"2022-09-21","We have seen some supply- side healing, but inflation has not really come down.","Q&A","Press Conf","","14","2022-09"
"2022-09-21","If you look at core PCE inflation, which is a good measure of where inflation is running now, if you look at it on a 3-, 6-, and 12-month trailing annualized basis, you’ll see that inflation is at 4.8 percent, 4.5 percent, and 4.8 percent.","Q&A","Press Conf","","45","2022-09"
"2022-09-21","So that’s a pretty good summary of where we are with inflation.","Q&A","Press Conf","","12","2022-09"
"2022-09-21","So if you look at them together—and, as I just mentioned, if you really look at this year’s inflation, 3-, 6-, and 12-month trailing, you see inflation is running too high.","Q&A","Press Conf","","31","2022-09"
"2022-09-21","For example, commodity prices look like they may have peaked for now; supply chain disruptions are beginning to resolve.","Q&A","Press Conf","","19","2022-09"
"2022-09-21","Those developments, if sustained, could help ease the pressures on inflation.","Q&A","Press Conf","","11","2022-09"
"2022-09-21","That’s going to depend on how quickly wage and price inflation pressures come down, whether expectations remain anchored, and whether, also, do we get more labor supply, which would help as well.","Q&A","Press Conf","","32","2022-09"
"2022-09-21","inflation back down to 2 percent—because we think that a failure to restore price stability would mean far greater pain later on.","Q&A","Press Conf","","22","2022-09"
"2022-09-21","But to the extent that continues to be the case, that should make it easier to restore price stability.","Q&A","Press Conf","","19","2022-09"
"2022-09-21","That and quits are really very good ways to look at how tight the labor market is and how different it is from other cycles, where, generally, the unemployment rate itself is the single best indicator.","Q&A","Press Conf","","36","2022-09"
"2022-09-21","Well, so, again, we believe that we need to raise our policy stance overall to a level that is restrictive—and by that I mean, is meaningfully, putting meaningful downward pressure on inflation.","Q&A","Press Conf","","32","2022-09"
"2022-09-21","And I think that would be the case if you look at the numbers that we’re writing down and think about—you measure those against some sort of forward-looking assessment of inflation, inflation expectations.","Q&A","Press Conf","","33","2022-09"
"2022-09-21","We think those things have, for quite a time now, really added value in terms of understanding where the labor market is.","Q&A","Press Conf","","22","2022-09"

"2022-11-30","Given our progress in tightening policy, the timing of that moderation is far less significant than the questions of how much further we will need to raise rates to control inflation, and the length of time it will be necessary to hold policy at a restrictive level.","General","Speech","N/A","47","2022-11"
"2022-11-30","It is likely that restoring price stability will require holding policy at a restrictive level for some time.","General","Speech","N/A","18","2022-11"

"2022-12-14","So that we—you know, there are channels through which the labor market can come back into balance with relatively modest increases in unemployment, we believe.","Q&A","Press Conf","","25","2022-12"

"2022-12-14","But there’s an expectation, really, that the services inflation will not move down so quickly, so that we’ll have to stay at it, so that we may have to raise rates higher to get to where we want to go.","Q&A","Press Conf","","40","2022-12"

"2023-02-01","Nonetheless, job gains had been robust in recent months, and the unemployment rate remained low.","Participants' Views","Minutes","N/A","15","2023-02"
"2023-02-01","In their discussion of current economic conditions, participants noted that recent indicators pointed to modest growth in spending and production.","Participants' Views","Minutes","N/A","20","2023-02"
"2023-02-01","So, again, as I just mentioned, we—you know, our forecasts— different participants have different forecasts, but, generally, those forecasts are for continued subdued growth, some softening in the labor market but not a recession, not a recession.","Q&A","Press Conf","","37","2023-02"
"2023-02-01","I’m not particularly concerned about the divergence, no, because it is largely due to the market’s expectation that inflation will move down more quickly.","Q&A","Press Conf","","24","2023-02"
"2023-02-01","You know, let’s say inflation does come down much faster than we expect, which is possible.","Q&A","Press Conf","","16","2023-02"
"2023-02-01","And so sectors that represent 55 or 60 percent of that— financial services is a big sector that’s really not driven by labor markets—wages.","Q&A","Press Conf","","24","2023-02"
"2023-02-01","So, clearly, labor is important for restaurants but so are food prices.","Q&A","Press Conf","","12","2023-02"
"2023-02-01","And, you know, transportation services is going to be driven by fuel prices, for example.","Q&A","Press Conf","","15","2023-02"
"2023-02-01","So there are lots of things in that mix that will drive inflation.","Q&A","Press Conf","","13","2023-02"
"2023-02-01","I would say overall, though, my own view would be that you’re not going to have, you know, a sustainable return to 2 percent inflation in that sector without a better balance in the labor market.","Q&A","Press Conf","","36","2023-02"
"2023-02-01","And I don’t know what that will require in terms of increased unemployment, your question.","Q&A","Press Conf","","15","2023-02"
"2023-02-01","I do think there are a number of dimensions through which the labor market can soften.","Q&A","Press Conf","","16","2023-02"
"2023-02-01","And so far, we’ve got—as I mentioned, in goods, we have inflation moving down without the softening in the labor market.","Q&A","Press Conf","","21","2023-02"
"2023-02-01","I think most forecasters would say that unemployment will probably rise a bit from here.","Q&A","Press Conf","","15","2023-02"
"2023-02-01","But I still think—I continue to think that there’s a path to getting inflation back down to 2 percent without a really significant economic decline or a significant increase in unemployment.","Q&A","Press Conf","","31","2023-02"
"2023-02-01","The inflation that we originally got was very much a collision between very strong demand and hard supply constraints, not something that you really have seen in prior— you know, in prior business cycles.","Q&A","Press Conf","","34","2023-02"
"2023-02-01","And so now we see goods inflation coming down for the reasons we thought, and we understand why housing inflation will come down.","Q&A","Press Conf","","23","2023-02"
"2023-02-01","And we said that we continue to anticipate that ongoing increases in the target range will be appropriate in order to attain that stance of sufficiently restrictive monetary policy that will bring inflation down to 2 percent.","Q&A","Press Conf","","37","2023-02"
"2023-02-01","But this is not something that the Federal Open Market Committee is on the point of deciding right now.","Q&A","Press Conf","","19","2023-02"
"2023-02-01","First, on the forecast, if—you’re right—if you take very short-term three-month, say, measures of PCE—core PCE inflation, they’re quite low right now.","Q&A","Press Conf","","22","2023-02"
"2023-02-01","But that’s because that’s driven by, you know, significantly negative readings from goods inflation.","Q&A","Press Conf","","14","2023-02"
"2023-02-01","Most forecasters would think that the significantly negative readings will be transitory and that goods inflation will move up fairly soon, back up to its longer-run trend of something around zero, something like that.","Q&A","Press Conf","","34","2023-02"
"2023-02-01","But I think there is— there’s ongoing disinflation, and we don’t yet see weakening in the labor market.","Q&A","Press Conf","","18","2023-02"
"2023-02-01","And so we are strongly resolved that we will, you know, complete this task because we think it has benefits that will, you know, support economic activity and benefit the public for many, many years.","Q&A","Press Conf","","35","2023-02"
"2023-02-01","You know, the—so we, of course, expected goods inflation to start coming down by the end of 2021, and it didn’t come down all through ’22.","Q&A","Press Conf","","26","2023-02"
"2023-02-01","So I would say these are—this is not a standard business cycle where you can look at the last 10 times there was a just harder to forecast inflation.","Q&A","Press Conf","","29","2023-02"
"2023-02-01","And, you know, our job is to deliver inflation back to target, and we will do that.","Q&A","Press Conf","","17","2023-02"
"2023-02-01","It’s just—it’s the early stages of disinflation.","Q&A","Press Conf","","7","2023-02"
"2023-02-01","And it’s most welcome to be able to say that we are now in disinflation, but that’s great.","Q&A","Press Conf","","18","2023-02"
"2023-02-01","You know, so—again, my forecast and that of my colleagues as you will see from the SEP and—I mean, there are many different forecasts, but, generally, it’s a forecast of slower growth, some softening in labor market conditions, and inflation moving down steadily but not quickly.","Q&A","Press Conf","","46","2023-02"
"2023-02-01","Of course, other people have forecasts with inflation coming down much faster, that’s a different thing.","Q&A","Press Conf","","16","2023-02"
"2023-02-01","You know, if that happens—inflation comes down much faster, you know, then we’ll be seeing that, and it will be incorporated into our thinking about policy.","Q&A","Press Conf","","26","2023-02"
"2023-02-01","In fact, I did that job for years but in one form or another.","Q&A","Press Conf","","14","2023-02"
"2023-02-01","We’re not—market participants have a very different job.","Q&A","Press Conf","","8","2023-02"
"2023-02-01","But I will say, though, we—you know, it is our job to restore price stability and achieve 2 percent inflation for the benefit of the American public.","Q&A","Press Conf","","27","2023-02"
"2023-02-01","So I do think you—most forecasts and, you know, my own assessment would be that that growth will continue—positive growth will continue but at a subdued pace as it did last year.","Q&A","Press Conf","","32","2023-02"
"2023-02-01","We had growth of—GDP growth of 1 percent last year and also final sales growth, which we think is a better indicator, of about 1 percent.","Q&A","Press Conf","","26","2023-02"
"2023-02-01","I think, you know, most forecasts and certainly my assessment would be that growth will continue at a fairly subdued level this year.","Q&A","Press Conf","","23","2023-02"
"2023-02-01","And so that’s going to support economic activity.","Q&A","Press Conf","","8","2023-02"
"2023-02-01","And that’s my base case, is that there will be positive growth this year.","Q&A","Press Conf","","14","2023-02"
"2023-02-01","So, of course, we’ll be looking—by the time of the March meeting, we’ll have two more employment reports, two more CPI reports, and we’ll be looking at those carefully as all of us will.","Q&A","Press Conf","","34","2023-02"
"2023-02-01","So I think there’s a good chance that those factors will help support positive growth this year.","Q&A","Press Conf","","17","2023-02"
"2023-03-22","Large-scale purchases of long-term securities are, are really meant to alter the stance of policy by pushing down—pushing up the price and down the rates, longer-term rates, which supports demand through channels we understand fairly well.","Q&A","Press Conf","","36","2023-03"
"2023-03-22","The balance sheet expansion is really temporary lending to banks to meet those special liquidity demands created by the recent tensions; it’s not intended to directly alter the stance of monetary policy.","Q&A","Press Conf","","32","2023-03"
"2023-03-22","So we’ll be watching all those things, and of course we will—we will eventually get to [a] tight enough policy to bring inflation down to 2 percent.","Q&A","Press Conf","","27","2023-03"
"2023-03-22","But, but I will tell you, though, that we have—there have been presentations about, about interest rate risk.","Q&A","Press Conf","","18","2023-03"
"2023-03-22","And we’ll also be watching what’s happening with inflation and in the labor market.","Q&A","Press Conf","","14","2023-03"
"2023-03-22","We know that can have, you know, an effect on the macroeconomy, on demand, on labor market, on inflation, and we’re—we’re going to be watching to see what that is.","Q&A","Press Conf","","30","2023-03"
"2023-03-22","We have responsibility for price stability.","Q&A","Press Conf","","6","2023-03"
"2023-03-22","So—and we will get inflation down to 2 percent in time.","Q&A","Press Conf","","11","2023-03"
"2023-03-22","You have to look at, at the impulse from spending because spending was, of course, tremendously high during the pandemic, and then, as the pandemic programs rolled off, spending actually came down, so the—this sort of fiscal impulse is actually not what’s driving inflation right now.","Q&A","Press Conf","","46","2023-03"
"2023-03-22","It was—it was at the beginning perhaps part of what was driving inflation, but that’s not really the story now.","Q&A","Press Conf","","20","2023-03"
"2023-03-22","So financial conditions seem to have tightened—and probably by more than the traditional indexes say, because traditional indexes are focused a lot on [interest] rates and [prices of] equities, and they don’t necessarily capture lending conditions.","Q&A","Press Conf","","36","2023-03"
"2023-03-22","You see late in an expansion—you see low unemployment, you see the benefits of wages going to people at the lower end of the wage spectrum.","Q&A","Press Conf","","26","2023-03"
"2023-03-22","It seems to have been a positive outcome in the sense that the transaction was agreed to, and it has been— the markets have accepted it, and it seems to have gone well, and I think there was a concern that it might not go well.","Q&A","Press Conf","","46","2023-03"
"2023-03-22","So that’s just—that’s an estimate of what will happen as demand slows and as conditions soften in the labor market and it’s just—it’s a highly uncertain estimate.","Q&A","Press Conf","","27","2023-03"
"2023-03-22","And, I mean, I was really—we have to bring inflation down to 2 percent.","Q&A","Press Conf","","14","2023-03"
"2023-03-22","We don’t know—if so, we don’t know how significant it will be, and so, you know, we’re very focused on getting inflation down because we know in the longer run that that is the thing that will most benefit the people we serve.","Q&A","Press Conf","","43","2023-03"
"2023-03-22","That’s how we can have a long—you know, we’ve had very strong the reason was inflation wasn’t forcing the central bank to come in and stop an incipient or, or, you know, an expansion.","Q&A","Press Conf","","34","2023-03"
"2023-03-22","You can have very, very long expansions without high inflation, and we had several of those, and they’re very good for people.","Q&A","Press Conf","","22","2023-03"
"2023-03-22","It’s also possible that this potential tightening will contribute significant tightening in credit conditions over time and, in principle, if that—that means that monetary policy may have less work to do.","Q&A","Press Conf","","31","2023-03"
"2023-03-22","I mean, with our monetary policy, we’re, we’re really focused on macroeconomic outcomes.","Q&A","Press Conf","","13","2023-03"
"2023-03-22","And, you know, in a way, the early—the data in the first part—the first five weeks of the intermeeting period pointed to stronger inflation and stronger labor markets.","Q&A","Press Conf","","28","2023-03"
"2023-03-22","You know, we know that we have other, other tools in effect, but no, we think our monetary policy tool works, and we think, you know, many, many banks—our rate hikes were well telegraphed to the market, and many banks have managed to handle them.","Q&A","Press Conf","","45","2023-03"
"2023-03-22","The issue was really not about those specific banks, but about the risk of a contagion to, to other banks and to the financial markets more broadly.","Q&A","Press Conf","","27","2023-03"
"2023-03-22","And, really, it is that the intermeeting data on inflation and the labor market came in stronger than expected and, really, before the recent events, we were clearly on track to continue with ongoing rate hikes.","Q&A","Press Conf","","36","2023-03"
"2023-03-22","In fact, as of a couple of weeks ago, it looked like we’d need to raise rates over the course of the that the public has confidence that we will do so—that we’ll bring inflation down to 2 percent over time.","Q&A","Press Conf","","41","2023-03"
"2023-03-22","So we also assess, as I mentioned, that the events of the last two weeks are likely to result in some tightening credit conditions for households and businesses and thereby weigh on demand, on the labor market, and on inflation.","Q&A","Press Conf","","40","2023-03"
"2023-03-22","So we published an SEP today, as you will have seen, and it shows that basically participants expect relatively slow growth, a gradual rebalancing of supply and always, the path of the economy is uncertain, and policy is going to reflect what actually happens rather than what we write down in the","Q&A","Press Conf","","52","2023-03"
"2023-03-22","Remember, we’re looking—for purposes of our monetary policy tool, we’re looking at what’s happening among the banks and asking, is there going to be some tightening in credit conditions?","Q&A","Press Conf","","29","2023-03"
"2023-03-22","So, the key is, we have to have—policy has got to be tight enough to bring inflation down to 2 percent over time.","Q&A","Press Conf","","23","2023-03"
"2023-03-22","In the meantime, you know—obviously, at the end of the day, we will do enough to bring inflation down to 2 percent.","Q&A","Press Conf","","22","2023-03"
"2023-03-22","There’s a great deal of literature on the connection between tighter credit conditions, economic activity, hiring, and inflation.","Q&A","Press Conf","","18","2023-03"
"2023-03-22","So, at a basic level, Silicon Valley Bank management failed badly—they grew the bank very quickly, they exposed the bank to significant liquidity risk and interest rate risk, didn’t hedge that risk.","Q&A","Press Conf","","32","2023-03"
"2023-03-22","And if you read your history, as I’m sure you have, you can see that if the central bank doesn’t get inflation back in place, get inflation—make sure that inflation expectations remain anchored, you can have a long series of years where inflation is high and volatile, and it’s hard to invest capital, it’s hard for an economy to perform well.","Q&A","Press Conf","","61","2023-03"

"2023-07-26","be some sort of a rebound there, and I’m curious what the Fed’s explanation would be to families if further interest rate hikes start to hit the labor market—start to, you know, drive that sentiment back down.","Q&A","Press Conf","","37","2023-07"
"2023-07-26","Well, you know, we have a job assigned to us by Congress to get inflation under control.","Q&A","Press Conf","","17","2023-07"
"2023-07-26","But that’s the way I would think about it, is you’d start—you’d stop raising long before you got to 2 percent inflation, and you’d start cutting before you got to 2 percent inflation, too, because we don’t see ourselves getting to 2 percent inflation until—you know, all the way back to 2—until 2025 or so.","Q&A","Press Conf","","55","2023-07"
"2023-07-26","So it’s, it has been my view consistently that we do have a shot, and my base case is that we will be able to achieve inflation moving back down to our target without the kind of really significant downturn that results in high levels of job losses that we’ve seen in some past—in some past instances, many past instances of tightening that look like ours.","Q&A","Press Conf","","66","2023-07"

"2023-07-26","I would just also say the historical record suggests that there’s very likely to be some softening in labor market conditions.","Q&A","Press Conf","","21","2023-07"
"2023-07-26","And consistent with having a soft landing, you would—you would have some softening in labor market conditions, and that’s still likely as we—as we go forward with this process.","Q&A","Press Conf","","29","2023-07"
"2023-07-26","We’ve seen softening through other—not through unemployment, not through higher unemployment.","Q&A","Press Conf","","11","2023-07"
"2023-07-26","We’ve seen softening through, you know, job openings coming down part of the way back to more normal levels; the quits rate, so people are not quitting as much; we’ve seen participation—people coming in, and so labor supply has, has improved, which has lowered the temperature in the labor market, which was quite overheated, you know, going back a year or so.","Q&A","Press Conf","","62","2023-07"
"2023-07-26","So the idea that we would keep hiking until inflation gets to 2 percent—it would be a prescription [for a policy] of going way past the target.","Q&A","Press Conf","","27","2023-07"

"2023-11-01","I think trying to make a clear—get a clear answer and say, “I’m just going to assume this is really not a good way to do it.” And this is one of the reasons why we have slowed the process down this year, was to give monetary policy time to get into the economy.","Q&A","Press Conf","","54","2023-11"

"2023-11-09","At the outset, many forecasters and analysts, including FOMC participants, viewed the sudden upturn in inflation as mostly a function of pandemic-related shifts in the composition of demand, a disruption of supply chains, and a sharp decline in labor supply.","General","Speech","N/A","40","2023-11"
"2023-11-09","Economic forecasters generally did not see this coming, as shown by the February 2021 Survey of Professional Forecasters, which showed core PCE inflation running at or below target over the subsequent three years.3The real-time questions for policymakers were what caused the high inflation and how policy should react.","General","Speech","N/A","48","2023-11"

"2024-01-31","So I’m not—I’m not seeing why it would, but, you know, right—you know, right now I would say that productivity is kind of what falls out of the, the broader forces that are driving people in and out of the labor force and, and activity returning and supply chains getting fixed.","Q&A","Press Conf","","51","2024-01"
"2024-01-31","It would take—you know, people talk about AI, but I would—my guess is that we may shake out and be back where we were, because I don’t—I’m not sure I see—work from home doesn’t seem like it’s a big productivity increase.","Q&A","Press Conf","","41","2024-01"

"2024-01-31","And I think—my, my own view is—I think if you look, look back to the pandemic, you, you saw a spike in productivity as workers were laid off, and, and activity didn’t decline as fast.","Q&A","Press Conf","","35","2024-01"
"2024-01-31","It isn’t every quarter, but, overall, there’s a clear trend—still at high levels, but back down to where—what would be consistent with, with where we were before the pandemic and with 2 percent inflation.","Q&A","Press Conf","","34","2024-01"
"2024-01-31","We, we included that language in the statement to signal clearly that—with strong growth, strong labor market, inflation coming down—the Committee intends to move carefully as we consider when to begin to dial back the restrictive stance that we have in place.","Q&A","Press Conf","","42","2024-01"
"2024-01-31","It’s still a good labor market for wages and for finding a job, but it’s getting back into balance, and that’s what we want to see.","Q&A","Press Conf","","26","2024-01"
"2024-01-31","But if you—a standard approach would be to take the nominal rate—5.3 percent, let’s say—and subtract sort of a, a forward measure of inflation.","Q&A","Press Conf","","24","2024-01"
"2024-01-31","So a lot of the growth we’re seeing is not—is—it isn’t just a tug of war between, between interest rates and demand.","Q&A","Press Conf","","22","2024-01"
"2024-01-31","You’re getting, you know, more activity because of the—of labor market healing and supply chains healing.","Q&A","Press Conf","","16","2024-01"

"2024-01-31","So I think, you know, job openings are not quite back to where they were.","Q&A","Press Conf","","15","2024-01"

"2024-01-31","But we do see—you saw today’s ECI reading—you know, the evidence is that, that wage increases are still at a healthy level—very healthy level—but they’re gradually moving back to levels that would be more associated—given, given assumptions about productivity, are more typically associated with 2 percent inflation.","Q&A","Press Conf","","47","2024-01"

"2024-01-31","And, you know, one obvious answer—we don’t pretend to have perfect wisdom on this—is—but one obvious answer is that the price level is high.","Q&A","Press Conf","","24","2024-01"
"2024-01-31","Yeah, so it’s been—it’s been interesting that confidence surveys have been weak, at a time when unemployment has been low—very low, historically low—for a couple of years.","Q&A","Press Conf","","27","2024-01"
"2024-01-31","But, you know, that’s the whole point is, we’re trying to get comfortable and gain confidence that that is where—that inflation is on a sustainable path down to 2 percent or toward 2 percent.","Q&A","Press Conf","","34","2024-01"

"2024-01-31","In the base case, though, where, where the economy is healthy and we have, you know, we have ongoing growth—solid growth—we have a strong labor market—we of that and, and be careful as we approach that question of when to begin to dial back restriction.","Q&A","Press Conf","","45","2024-01"
"2024-01-31","And if we saw inflation being stickier or higher or those sorts of things—would argue for moving later.","Q&A","Press Conf","","18","2024-01"
"2024-01-31","If we saw an unexpected weakening in, in—certainly in the labor market, that would certainly weigh on cutting sooner.","Q&A","Press Conf","","19","2024-01"
"2024-01-31","But, yes, if you think about, you know—in, in the base case, the economy is performing well—the labor market remains strong.","Q&A","Press Conf","","21","2024-01"
"2024-01-31","I would just say, if you look at—you know, look at where, where 12-month inflation is, and it’s, you know, it’s still well above—core is 2.9 percent, for example—12-month—which is way down from where it was.","Q&A","Press Conf","","36","2024-01"
"2024-01-31","And I think to move, which is—which is where almost everyone on the Committee is—is in favor of, of moving rates down this year—but the timing of that is going to be linked to our gaining confidence that inflation is on a sustainable path down to 2 percent.","Q&A","Press Conf","","48","2024-01"
"2024-01-31","But at the same time, we think goods inflation will probably—it’s been giving a lot of disinflation to the effort—and probably that declines over time, but it may well have some, some still a tailwind.","Q&A","Press Conf","","35","2024-01"
"2024-01-31","So the question is, when will these lower market rents find their way into measured rents, as measured, measured in PCE inflation?","Q&A","Press Conf","","22","2024-01"
"2024-01-31","Which would be: Goods inflation—I talked about that a little bit; you mentioned housing inflation.","Q&A","Press Conf","","15","2024-01"
"2024-01-31","So, of course, we follow the, the components of inflation very carefully.","Q&A","Press Conf","","12","2024-01"
"2024-01-31","But that doesn’t mean we can mechanically adjust policy as real rates—sorry—as inflation comes down.","Q&A","Press Conf","","15","2024-01"
"2024-01-31","Another way to think about it is, implicitly, is—so, in theory, of course, real rates go up if—holding all else equal—as inflation comes down.","Q&A","Press Conf","","24","2024-01"
"2024-01-31","We’re looking for inflation to continue to come down, as it has been coming down for the last six months.","Q&A","Press Conf","","20","2024-01"
"2024-01-31","We’re not looking for a weaker labor market.","Q&A","Press Conf","","8","2024-01"
"2024-01-31","We want to see a strong labor market.","Q&A","Press Conf","","8","2024-01"
"2024-01-31","I think, at this point, we want to see strong growth.","Q&A","Press Conf","","11","2024-01"
"2024-01-31","So I think we, we look at—we look at stronger growth.","Q&A","Press Conf","","11","2024-01"
"2024-01-31","So I think—whereas a year ago, we, we were thinking that we needed to see some softening in economic activity—that hasn’t been the case.","Q&A","Press Conf","","24","2024-01"
"2024-01-31","And yet we’ve had a very strong labor market, and we’ve had inflation coming down.","Q&A","Press Conf","","15","2024-01"
"2024-01-31","I mean, if you take a step back, we’ve had strong growth—very strong growth [in real GDP] last year—going right into the fourth quarter.","Q&A","Press Conf","","24","2024-01"
"2024-01-31","The question really is, that six months of good inflation data—is it sending us a true signal that we are, in fact, on a path—a sustainable path down to 2 percent inflation?","Q&A","Press Conf","","32","2024-01"
"2024-01-31","So we have six months of good inflation data.","Q&A","Press Conf","","9","2024-01"
"2024-01-31","It’s—we’re looking at continuation of the good data that we’ve been seeing, and a good example is inflation.","Q&A","Press Conf","","18","2024-01"
"2024-01-31","In terms of, of growth, we’ve had strong growth.","Q&A","Press Conf","","9","2024-01"
"2024-01-31","We have six months of good inflation [readings].","Q&A","Press Conf","","8","2024-01"
"2024-01-31","But you can—and you know this—you can look behind those numbers, and you can see that a lot of it’s been coming from goods inflation, for example, and goods inflation running significantly negative.","Q&A","Press Conf","","33","2024-01"
"2024-01-31","But I think to get to that place where we feel comfortable starting the process, we need some confirmation that inflation is, in fact, coming down sustainably to 2 percent.","Q&A","Press Conf","","30","2024-01"
"2024-01-31","We’re—what we’re trying to do is identify a place where we’re really confident about inflation getting back down to 2 percent so that we can then begin the process of dialing back the restrictive level.","Q&A","Press Conf","","35","2024-01"
"2024-01-31","The labor market is strong.","Q&A","Press Conf","","5","2024-01"
"2024-01-31","You know, we, we feel like inflation is coming down.","Q&A","Press Conf","","10","2024-01"
"2024-01-31","But us confidence that we’re on, on a path to—a sustainable path down to 2 percent inflation.","Q&A","Press Conf","","17","2024-01"
"2024-01-31","It’s a reasonable assumption that, over time, goods inflation will flatten out—probably approximate zero.","Q&A","Press Conf","","14","2024-01"
"2024-01-31","Growth only matters to the extent it influences our achievement of those two—of those two mandates.","Q&A","Press Conf","","16","2024-01"
"2024-03-20","And when I say something—I, I use the term “unexpected” weakening of the labor market.","Q&A","Press Conf","","15","2024-03"
"2024-03-20","So, you know, we do expect the unemployment rate to—the forecast is that it would move up, I think, closer to what we see as the longer-run sustainable level.","Q&A","Press Conf","","29","2024-03"
"2024-03-20","You know, you do see things like the low— the low hiring rate, and people have made the argument that if, if layoffs were to increase, that would—that would mean that the net would be fairly quick increases in unemployment.","Q&A","Press Conf","","40","2024-03"
"2024-03-20","So the labor market is—it’s in good shape.","Q&A","Press Conf","","8","2024-03"
"2024-03-20","We all monitor the labor market very, very carefully.","Q&A","Press Conf","","9","2024-03"
"2024-03-20","And I, you know—we follow all the possible stories that are out there about, about there being cracks, but the overall picture really is a strong labor market.","Q&A","Press Conf","","28","2024-03"
"2024-03-20","That’s job openings and quits.","Q&A","Press Conf","","5","2024-03"
"2024-03-20","And surveys of workers and businesses are always interesting on this: You know, how tight is the—how easy is it to find a job?","Q&A","Press Conf","","24","2024-03"
"2024-03-20","So that’s—in terms of how it ends, we’re going to be monitoring carefully money market conditions and asking ourselves whether they—what they’re telling us about reserves.","Q&A","Press Conf","","26","2024-03"
"2024-03-20","We’re going to be looking at what these— what’s happening in money markets, in particular—a bunch of different indicators, including the ones I mentioned, to tell us when we’re getting close.","Q&A","Press Conf","","31","2024-03"
"2024-03-20","We want to have a cushion, a buffer, because we know that demand for reserves can be very volatile.","Q&A","Press Conf","","19","2024-03"
"2024-03-20","So we’re—most importantly, we’re looking at the incoming inflation data and the contents of it and what they’re telling us, so that’ll be—and also the various components—so obviously that’s what we want.","Q&A","Press Conf","","32","2024-03"
"2024-03-20","So that’s—but at the end of the day, we take that on board, but we have to make our judgments, and we have to “stick to our knitting”— which is maximum employment, price stability, supervise and regulate the banks, work on the payment system: the things that we do.","Q&A","Press Conf","","49","2024-03"
"2024-03-20","I think it’s, it’s—we think that rates were generally low during the pre-pandemic post–Global Financial Crisis era for reasons that are mostly, you know, important, slow-moving, large things like demographics and productivity and that sort of thing—things that don’t move quickly.","Q&A","Press Conf","","41","2024-03"
"2024-03-20","I also mentioned—and we don’t see this in the data right now, but if there were a significant weakening in the data, particularly in the labor market, that could also be a reason for us to begin the process of meeting.","Q&A","Press Conf","","41","2024-03"
"2024-03-20","Nonetheless, we’re looking for data that confirm the kind of low readings that we had last year and give us a higher degree of confidence that what we saw was really inflation moving sustainably down to 2 percent—toward 2 percent.","Q&A","Press Conf","","40","2024-03"
"2024-03-20","So I just would say that the Committee wants to see more data that gives us higher confidence that inflation is moving down sustainably toward 2 percent.","Q&A","Press Conf","","27","2024-03"
"2024-03-20","But I take the two of them together, and I think they haven’t really changed the overall story, which is that of inflation moving down gradually on a sometimes-bumpy road toward 2 percent.","Q&A","Press Conf","","33","2024-03"
"2024-03-20","I the good inflation readings we got in the last seven months of last year.","Q&A","Press Conf","","15","2024-03"
"2024-03-20","So, so, if what we’re getting is a lot of supply and a lot of demand, and that supply is actually feeding demand because workers are getting paid and they’re spending and that’s, you know—what you would have is potentially kind of what you had last last year with—both with supply chains and also with, with growth in the size of the labor force.","Q&A","Press Conf","","64","2024-03"
"2024-03-20","I mean, we saw—you saw last year very strong hiring and inflation coming down quickly.","Q&A","Press Conf","","15","2024-03"
"2024-03-20","We now have a better sense that a big part of that was supply-side healing, particularly with, with growth in the labor force.","Q&A","Press Conf","","23","2024-03"
"2024-03-20","In the meantime, the economy is strong, the labor market is strong, inflation has come way down, and that gives us the ability to approach this question carefully and feel more confident that inflation is moving down sustainably at 2 percent when we take that step to begin dialing back our restrictive policy.","Q&A","Press Conf","","53","2024-03"
"2024-03-20","And, fortunately, with the economy growing, with the labor market strong, and with inflation coming down, we can approach that question carefully and let the data speak on that.","Q&A","Press Conf","","29","2024-03"
"2024-03-20","But I would say that the story is really essentially the same and that is of inflation coming down gradually toward 2 percent on a sometimes-bumpy path, as I mentioned.","Q&A","Press Conf","","30","2024-03"
"2024-03-20","We’ve got nine months of 2½ percent inflation now, and we’ve had two months of kind of bumpy inflation.","Q&A","Press Conf","","19","2024-03"
"2024-03-20","It is very important for everyone that we serve that we do get inflation sustainably down.","Q&A","Press Conf","","16","2024-03"
"2024-03-20","We want more confidence that inflation is coming down sustainably toward 2 percent.","Q&A","Press Conf","","13","2024-03"
"2024-03-20","You know, we tend to see a little bit stronger—this is in the data—a little bit stronger inflation in the first half of the year, a little bit less strong later in the year.","Q&A","Press Conf","","34","2024-03"
"2024-03-20","So, in and of itself, strong job growth is not a reason, you know, for us to be concerned about inflation.","Q&A","Press Conf","","21","2024-03"
"2024-03-20","But, ultimately, we do think that financial conditions are weighing on economic activity, and we think you see that in—a great place to see it is in the labor market, where you’ve seen demand cooling off a little bit from the extremely high levels.","Q&A","Press Conf","","44","2024-03"
"2024-03-20","And there I would point to job openings, quits, surveys, the hiring rate.","Q&A","Press Conf","","13","2024-03"
"2024-03-20","Things like that are really demand.","Q&A","Press Conf","","6","2024-03"
"2024-03-20","There are also supply-side things happening, but I think those are demand-side things happening.","Q&A","Press Conf","","14","2024-03"
"2024-03-20","We did see progress on inflation last year—significant progress, despite financial conditions sometimes being tighter, sometimes looser.","Q&A","Press Conf","","17","2024-03"
"2024-03-20","give us more color on how the Committee is thinking about inflation dynamics now?","Q&A","Press Conf","","14","2024-03"

"2024-05-01","Again, it’s, it’s—we’ve set ourselves a test that we—for us to begin to reduce policy restriction, we’d want to be confident that inflation is moving—you know, moving sustainably down to 2 percent, and, for sure, one of the things we’d be looking at is the performance of inflation.","Q&A","Press Conf","","48","2024-05"
"2024-05-01","And those would be—two of those paths would be that we do gain greater confidence, as we’ve said, that inflation is moving sustainably down to 2 percent, and another path could be, you know, an unexpected weakening in the labor market, for example.","Q&A","Press Conf","","43","2024-05"
"2024-05-01","So, for example, let me take a path: If we did have a path where inflation proves more persistent than expected and where the labor market remains strong, but inflation is moving sideways and we’re not gaining greater confidence, well, that would be a case in which it could be appropriate to hold off on rate cuts.","Q&A","Press Conf","","57","2024-05"
"2024-05-01","And we’ve said that we don’t think it would be appropriate to dial back our restrictive policy stance until we’ve gained greater confidence that inflation is moving down sustainably toward 2 percent.","Q&A","Press Conf","","32","2024-05"

"2024-05-01","So I think I would take that question this way: We saw a year of very high productivity growth in 2023, and we saw a year of, I think, negative productivity growth in 2022.","Q&A","Press Conf","","34","2024-05"
"2024-05-01","I mean, the question is, will productivity run—there are two questions.","Q&A","Press Conf","","11","2024-05"
"2024-05-01","One is: Will productivity run persistently above its longer-run trend?","Q&A","Press Conf","","10","2024-05"
"2024-05-01","And there are stories behind how that happened, and, you know, we—I think—I think my expectation is that we will, over the course of this year, see inflation move back down.","Q&A","Press Conf","","31","2024-05"
"2024-05-01","What’s happened since December is you’ve seen higher goods inflation than expected, and you’ve seen higher nonhousing services inflation than expected.","Q&A","Press Conf","","21","2024-05"
"2024-05-01","And the signal that we’re taking is that it’s likely to take longer for us to gain confidence that we are on a sustainable path down to 2 percent inflation.","Q&A","Press Conf","","30","2024-05"
"2024-05-01","And, in addition, I would say most forecasters, including our forecasting, was that last year’s level of growth was very high—3.4 percent in, I guess, the fourth quarter, you know— and probably not going to be sustained and would come down.","Q&A","Press Conf","","41","2024-05"
"2024-05-01","It was high single-digits inflation.","Q&A","Press Conf","","5","2024-05"
"2024-05-01","So our focus was very much on inflation.","Q&A","Press Conf","","8","2024-05"
"2024-05-01","And that was clearly inflation.","Q&A","Press Conf","","5","2024-05"
"2024-05-01","In terms of the employment mandate, to your point, if you go back a couple of years, our, our sort of framework document says that, when you look at the two mandate goals, and if one of them is further away from goal than the other, then you focus on that one.","Q&A","Press Conf","","52","2024-05"
"2024-05-01","But all I can say is that, you know, we’ve said that we didn’t think it would be appropriate to cut until we were more confident that inflation was moving sustainably down to 2 percent.","Q&A","Press Conf","","35","2024-05"
"2024-05-01","It really is to ensure that the process of shrinking the balance sheet down to where we want to get it is a smooth one and doesn’t wind up in—with financial market turmoil the way it did the last—the last time we did this and the only other time we’ve ever done this.","Q&A","Press Conf","","53","2024-05"
"2024-05-01","I mean, the active tool of monetary policy is, of course, the interest rates.","Q&A","Press Conf","","14","2024-05"
"2024-05-01","We also continue to expect, and I continue to expect, that housing services inflation, given where market rents are, those will show up in measured housing services inflation over time.","Q&A","Press Conf","","30","2024-05"
"2024-05-01","The employment goal now comes back into focus.","Q&A","Press Conf","","8","2024-05"
"2024-05-01","And I don’t have great confidence in which of those paths—I think I would say my personal forecast is that we will begin to see further progress on inflation this year.","Q&A","Press Conf","","31","2024-05"
"2024-05-01","I guess I would say I was around for stagflation, and it was, you know, 10 percent—10 percent unemployment.","Q&A","Press Conf","","19","2024-05"
"2024-05-01","Right now we have—and very slow growth—so right now we have 3 percent growth, which is, you know, pretty solid growth I would say, by any measure, and we have inflation running under 3 percent.","Q&A","Press Conf","","35","2024-05"
"2024-05-01","So if we were to conclude that policy is not sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation sustainably down to 2 percent, then that would be what it would take for us to want to increase rates.","Q&A","Press Conf","","35","2024-05"
"2024-05-01","“Three percent” can’t be in a sentence with “satisfied.” [Laughter] So we will return inflation to 2 percent over time but over time.","Q&A","Press Conf","","23","2024-05"
"2024-05-01","Well, of course we’re not satisfied with 3 percent inflation.","Q&A","Press Conf","","10","2024-05"
"2024-05-01","As inflation has come down, now to below 3 percent on a—on a 12-month basis, it’s become—we’re now focusing [on] the other goal.","Q&A","Press Conf","","23","2024-05"
"2024-05-01","We believe it’s restrictive, and, you know, we—our evidence more from monetary policy, whereas the supply side of things that are happening are more on the supply side.","Q&A","Press Conf","","28","2024-05"
"2024-05-01","So it—there may be—it may be that you get more supply than you get demand at the beginning, but, ultimately, it should be neither inflationary nor disinflationary over, over a longer period.","Q&A","Press Conf","","32","2024-05"

"2024-09-18","Almost all members agreed that to appropriately reflect cumulative developments related to inflation and the balance of risks, the postmeeting statement should note that they had gained greater confidence that inflation was moving sustainably toward 2 percent and judged that the risks to achieving the Committee's employment and inflation goals were roughly in balance.","Committee Policy Action","Minutes","N/A","54","2024-09"

"2024-09-18","So I think it’s about—we come into this with a policy position that was put in place, as you know, I mentioned, in July of 2023, which was a time of high inflation and very low unemployment.","Q&A","Press Conf","","37","2024-09"
"2024-09-18","We are more—we have greater confidence now that inflation is moving down to 2 percent, but, at the same time, our plan is that we will be at 2 percent, you know, over time.","Q&A","Press Conf","","34","2024-09"
"2024-09-18","So if—as I mentioned in my remarks, if the labor market were to slow unexpectedly, then we have the ability to react to that by, by cutting faster.","Q&A","Press Conf","","28","2024-09"
"2024-09-18","So we’re not waiting for that, because, you know, there is—there is thinking that the time to support the labor market is when—is when it’s strong and not when we begin to see the layoffs.","Q&A","Press Conf","","35","2024-09"
"2024-09-18","So that should also support the labor market over time.","Q&A","Press Conf","","10","2024-09"
"2024-09-18","In the meantime, if you look at the growth in economic activity data, retail sales data that we just got, second-quarter GDP—all of this indicates an economy that is still growing at a solid pace.","Q&A","Press Conf","","35","2024-09"
"2024-09-18","But ultimately, we think—we believe, with an appropriate recalibration of our policy, that we can continue to see the economy growing, and that will support the labor market.","Q&A","Press Conf","","28","2024-09"
"2024-09-18","So the labor market bears close—bears close watching, and we’ll be giving it that.","Q&A","Press Conf","","14","2024-09"
"2024-09-18","By many other measures, the labor market has returned to or below 2019 levels, which was a very good, strong labor market, but this is more sort of 2018, ’17.","Q&A","Press Conf","","30","2024-09"
"2024-09-18","So I think what we’re seeing is, clearly labor market conditions have cooled off by any measure, as I talked about in Jackson Hole, and—but they’re still at a level— the level of those conditions is actually pretty close to what I would call maximum employment.","Q&A","Press Conf","","46","2024-09"
"2024-09-18","So, you know, what I would say is, we don’t think we need to see further loosening in labor market conditions to get inflation down to 2 percent.","Q&A","Press Conf","","28","2024-09"
"2024-09-18","We’re trying to achieve a situation where we restore price stability without the kind of painful increase in unemployment that has come sometimes with disinflation.","Q&A","Press Conf","","25","2024-09"
"2024-09-18","We’ll see another jobs report.","Q&A","Press Conf","","5","2024-09"
"2024-09-18","The question isn’t the level; the question is that there has been change, particularly over the last few months, and, you know, so what we say is, as the risks, the upside risks, to inflation have really come down, the position to manage the risks to both of our goals.","Q&A","Press Conf","","50","2024-09"
"2024-09-18","They say this is still a solid labor market.","Q&A","Press Conf","","9","2024-09"
"2024-09-18","There are many, many employment indicators.","Q&A","Press Conf","","6","2024-09"
"2024-09-18","Wages are still a bit above what would be their—wage increases, rather, are still just a bit above where they would be over the very longer term to be consistent with 2 percent inflation, but they’re very much coming down to what that sustainable level is.","Q&A","Press Conf","","46","2024-09"
"2024-09-18","And anything in the low 4s is, is a really—is a good labor market.","Q&A","Press Conf","","14","2024-09"
"2024-09-18","That’s a very healthy unemployment rate.","Q&A","Press Conf","","6","2024-09"
"2024-09-18","So we’ll start with unemployment, which is the single most important one probably.","Q&A","Press Conf","","13","2024-09"
"2024-09-18","We’ve waited, and I think that that patience has really paid dividends in the form of our confidence that inflation is moving sustainably under 2 percent.","Q&A","Press Conf","","26","2024-09"
"2024-09-18","If you look at the SEP, you’ll, you’ll see that it’s, it’s a process of recalibrating our policy stance away from where we had it a year ago, when inflation was high and unemployment low, to a place that’s more appropriate given where we are now and where we expect to be.","Q&A","Press Conf","","52","2024-09"
"2024-09-18","We’ve also had two inflation reports, including one that came in during blackout.","Q&A","Press Conf","","13","2024-09"

"2024-09-18","We had a historically tight labor market, historically tight.","Q&A","Press Conf","","9","2024-09"
"2024-09-18","So, again, the labor market is actually in solid condition, and our intention with our policy move today is to keep it there.","Q&A","Press Conf","","23","2024-09"
"2024-09-18","I think we get a—we might, actually— we get two—we get a second jobs report on the day of the meeting, I think, or no, no, on the Friday before the meeting.","Q&A","Press Conf","","32","2024-09"
"2024-09-18","We made a good, strong start to this, and that’s really, frankly, a sign of our confidence—confidence that inflation is, is coming down toward 2 percent on a sustainable basis.","Q&A","Press Conf","","30","2024-09"
"2024-09-18","So we know that it is time to recalibrate our policy to something that is more appropriate given the progress on inflation and on employment moving to a more sustainable level.","Q&A","Press Conf","","31","2024-09"
"2024-09-18","is up to 4.2 percent; inflation’s down to a few tenths above 2.","Q&A","Press Conf","","13","2024-09"
"2024-09-18","We’ll look at—each meeting, we’ll look at all the data on inflation, economic activity, and the labor market, and we’ll make decisions about, is our policy stance where it needs to be to foster over the medium term our mandate goals?","Q&A","Press Conf","","41","2024-09"
"2024-09-18","You know, it will be—the unemployment rate’s very important, of course, but there isn’t a single statistic or single bright line over which that thing that might move that would dictate one thing or another.","Q&A","Press Conf","","35","2024-09"
"2024-09-18","So we will continue to look at that broad array of labor market data, including the payroll numbers.","Q&A","Press Conf","","18","2024-09"
"2024-09-18","And, of course, people are [still] experiencing high prices, as opposed to high inflation.","Q&A","Press Conf","","14","2024-09"
"2024-09-18","Price stability benefits everybody over a long period of time, just by virtue of the fact that they don’t have to deal with inflation.","Q&A","Press Conf","","24","2024-09"
"2024-09-18","That’s where everyone wants to be, is back to what’s inflation, you know?","Q&A","Press Conf","","13","2024-09"
"2024-09-18","And a good definition of price stability is that people in their daily decisions, they’re not thinking about inflation anymore.","Q&A","Press Conf","","20","2024-09"
"2024-09-18","It’s not something that people experience as pleasant, but, at the end, what you get is low inflation restored, price stability restored.","Q&A","Press Conf","","22","2024-09"
"2024-09-18","Many other countries around the world had a similar burst of inflation, and, when that happens, part of the answer is that we raise interest rates in order to cool the economy off in order to reduce inflationary pressures.","Q&A","Press Conf","","39","2024-09"
"2024-09-18","Well, what I can say to the public is that we had the highest—we had a burst of inflation.","Q&A","Press Conf","","19","2024-09"
"2024-09-18","And the reason is that people have found over time that insulating the central bank from direct control by political authorities avoids making monetary policy in a way that favors maybe people who are in office as opposed to people who are not in office.","Q&A","Press Conf","","45","2024-09"
"2024-09-18","So that’s the idea, is that— you know, I think the data are clear that countries that have independent central banks, they get lower inflation.","Q&A","Press Conf","","25","2024-09"
"2024-09-18","There was a severe labor shortage, so very hot labor market.","Q&A","Press Conf","","11","2024-09"
"2024-09-18","And we had inflation way above target.","Q&A","Press Conf","","7","2024-09"
"2024-09-18","So, you know, that said to us, concentrate on inflation, concentrate on inflation.","Q&A","Press Conf","","13","2024-09"
"2024-09-18","And we did for a while, and we kept at that, that the stance that we put in place 14 months ago was a stance that was focused on bringing down inflation.","Q&A","Press Conf","","32","2024-09"
"2024-09-18","Part of bringing down inflation, though, is cooling off the economy and a little bit cooling off the labor market.","Q&A","Press Conf","","20","2024-09"
"2024-09-18","You now have a cooler labor market, in part because of our activity.","Q&A","Press Conf","","13","2024-09"

"2024-09-18","Our job is to support the economy on behalf of the American people.","Q&A","Press Conf","","13","2024-09"
"2024-09-18","I mean, we’ve seen a lot of, of tightness come out of the labor market in that form without it resulting in lower employment.","Q&A","Press Conf","","24","2024-09"
"2024-09-18","And yes, I mean, I think we are—it’s hard to know that—you can’t know these things with great precision, but certainly it appears that we’re very close to that point, if not at it, so that further declines in job openings will translate more directly into unemployment.","Q&A","Press Conf","","47","2024-09"
"2024-09-18","On the Beveridge curve question, yes, so we all felt, on the Committee, not all, but I think everyone on the Committee felt that job openings were so elevated that they could fall a long way before you hit the part of the curve where job openings turned into higher unemployment, job loss.","Q&A","Press Conf","","53","2024-09"
"2024-09-18","So, if you’re having millions of people come into the labor force then, and you’re creating influx across the borders, and that has actually been one of the things that’s, that’s, that’s allowed the unemployment rate to rise.","Q&A","Press Conf","","38","2024-09"
"2024-09-18","So, on the job creation, it depends on—it depends on the inflows, right?","Q&A","Press Conf","","13","2024-09"
"2024-09-18","So inflation, you know—what we say is we want inflation—the goal is to have inflation move down to 2 percent on a sustainable basis.","Q&A","Press Conf","","24","2024-09"
"2024-09-18","And then the supply question will have to be dealt with by the market and also by government.","Q&A","Press Conf","","18","2024-09"
"2024-09-18","And, I mean, ultimately by getting inflation broadly down and getting those rates normalized and getting the housing cycle normalized, that’s the best thing we can do for house holders.","Q&A","Press Conf","","30","2024-09"
"2024-09-18","But I think, as we normalize rates, you’ll see the housing market normalize.","Q&A","Press Conf","","13","2024-09"
"2024-09-18","So it’s not, you know, obvious how much additional demand that would make.","Q&A","Press Conf","","13","2024-09"
"2024-09-18","The housing market, it’s hard to—it’s a game that—the housing market is in part frozen because of lock-in with low rates.","Q&A","Press Conf","","21","2024-09"
"2024-09-18","We will get down to 2 percent inflation, I believe, and I believe that, ultimately, we’ll get what we need to get out of the housing services piece, too.","Q&A","Press Conf","","29","2024-09"
"2024-09-18","So I would say it’s—the rest of the portfolio—or of the elements that go into core PCE inflation have behaved pretty well.","Q&A","Press Conf","","22","2024-09"
"2024-09-18","As long as market rents remain under control, the outcome is not as in doubt.","Q&A","Press Conf","","15","2024-09"
"2024-09-18","But, you know, the direction of travel is clear, and as long as market rents remain, you know, relatively low inflation, over time that will show up, just the time it’s taking now, several years rather than just one or two cycles of annual lease renewals.","Q&A","Press Conf","","46","2024-09"

"2024-11-07","So, overall, though, I think you take away a sense of, of some of the downside risks to economic activity having, having been diminished, with the NIPA revisions in particular, and so, overall, feeling, feeling good about economic activity.","Q&A","Press Conf","","39","2024-11"

"2024-11-07","[Laughter] You know, it’s, of course, a very difficult thing because you’re—you know, you’re—anything you do with interest rates will, will hurt one side or the other, either the inflation mandate or the—or the employment mandate.","Q&A","Press Conf","","36","2024-11"

"2024-11-07","I think, you know, the comments from our Reserve Bank colleagues and from the CEOs that they talk to are pretty constructive on the economy right now—pretty constructive, feeling that the labor market is, is, you know, back to normal to the point where it’s no longer People feel good about where the economy is.","Q&A","Press Conf","","55","2024-11"

"2024-11-07","And—but as you look forward, you say, “What are the risks?” And one risk is that we would move too quickly and find ourselves having moved too quickly, and inflation comes back, and we—and we lost our chance to get inflation back to 2 percent.","Q&A","Press Conf","","45","2024-11"
"2024-11-07","The other risk is that we move too slowly and that we allow the labor market to weaken too much and do unnecessary damage to the labor market and to people’s working lives.","Q&A","Press Conf","","33","2024-11"

"2024-12-18","But we, we, you know, we’d be seeing meaningful progress to get inflation down to that level.","Q&A","Press Conf","","17","2024-12"
"2024-12-18","You pointed out we’ve just been through a period of high inflation.","Q&A","Press Conf","","12","2024-12"

"2024-12-18","What the Committee’s doing now is, is discussing pathways and understanding, again, the ways in which tariff-driven inflation can affect—tariffs can affect inflation and the economy, and, and how to think about that.","Q&A","Press Conf","","33","2024-12"
"2024-12-18","So the, the main thing is—and this is also a point in these alternative simulations—is that there’re just many, many factors that go into what, what—how much tariffs will, will even go into consumer inflation.","Q&A","Press Conf","","35","2024-12"
"2024-12-18","We, we also have to think about the, the, you know, the labor market.","Q&A","Press Conf","","14","2024-12"

"2024-12-18","So I, I would say I’m confident that inflation has come down a great deal, and I, I’m confident in the story about why it’s come down and why that portends well.","Q&A","Press Conf","","32","2024-12"
"2024-12-18","You, again, you do see with housing services inflation, which is one that we’ve really worried, worried about, it really has come down now quite steadily, at a slower pace than we thought, you know, two years ago, but it’s rents is new leases.","Q&A","Press Conf","","44","2024-12"
"2024-12-18","Goods inflation, which is another big piece of it, has returned right to the range where it was before the pandemic.","Q&A","Press Conf","","21","2024-12"
"2024-12-18","Then that leaves nonhousing services, and market-based nonhousing services are in, in good shape.","Q&A","Press Conf","","14","2024-12"
"2024-12-18","It’s nonmarket services, and those are—those are services that are imputed rather than measured directly, and they, they don’t, we, we think they don’t really tell us much about the, you know, about tightness in the economy.","Q&A","Press Conf","","37","2024-12"
"2024-12-18","I mean, a good example is financial services, which is really done off of asset prices, and that just—so that, that’s how that inflation works.","Q&A","Press Conf","","25","2024-12"
"2024-12-18","So the overall picture, the story of why inflation should be coming down, is still intact.","Q&A","Press Conf","","16","2024-12"
"2024-12-18","In particular, the labor market—look at the labor market.","Q&A","Press Conf","","9","2024-12"

"2024-12-18","Job creation is now well below the level or certainly below the level that would hold unemployment constant, the job-finding rate is low and declining, and other measures—such as surveys of workers and businesses, quits, things like that—broadly show a, a much cooler labor market than there was, than we had in 2019.","Q&A","Press Conf","","53","2024-12"

"2024-12-18","I, I think that the lower—the slower pace of cuts for next year really reflects both the higher inflation readings we’ve had this year and the expectation that inflation will be higher.","Q&A","Press Conf","","32","2024-12"
"2024-12-18","You saw in the SEP that risks and, and uncertainty around inflation we see as higher.","Q&A","Press Conf","","16","2024-12"

"2024-12-18","Growth of consumer spending has remained resilient, and investment in equipment and intangibles has strengthened.","Opening Statement","Press Conf","","15","2024-12"
"2024-12-18","So I would say today was a—was a closer call, but we decided it was the right call because we thought it was the best decision to foster achievement of both of our goals, maximum employment and price stability.","Q&A","Press Conf","","39","2024-12"
"2024-12-18","But as for additional cuts, we’re going to be looking for further progress on inflation as well as continued strength in the labor market.","Q&A","Press Conf","","24","2024-12"
"2024-12-18","The only thing, really, that’s happened—you, you mentioned that the disinflationary story remains intact, yet the risk weighting has jumped to the upside.","Q&A","Press Conf","","23","2024-12"
"2024-12-18","Is it fair to say that that’s what’s driving the higher sense of upside risk on inflation?","Q&A","Press Conf","","17","2024-12"
"2024-12-18","What’s happened is that our forecast for inflation for this year, I think, are five-tenths higher than they were in September.","Q&A","Press Conf","","21","2024-12"
"2024-12-18","So, you’ve got—you had two months of higher inflation, September and October.","Q&A","Press Conf","","12","2024-12"
"2024-12-18","But, you know, once again we’ve, you know, we’ve had a year-end projection for inflation and it’s kind of fallen apart as we’ve approached the end of the year.","Q&A","Press Conf","","29","2024-12"
"2024-12-18","I can tell you that might be the single biggest factor is inflation has once again underperformed relative to expectations.","Q&A","Press Conf","","20","2024-12"
"2024-12-18","But, you know, we really want to see progress on inflation, to, to, you know, as I mentioned, as we think about further cuts, we’re going to be looking for progress on inflation.","Q&A","Press Conf","","33","2024-12"
"2024-12-18","That’s in part because inflation was very, very low measured in, in the 4th quarter of 2023.","Q&A","Press Conf","","17","2024-12"
"2024-12-18","And as long as the economy and the labor market are solid, we can be cautious about—as we consider further cuts.","Q&A","Press Conf","","21","2024-12"
"2024-12-18","First thing is growth is stronger, right?","Q&A","Press Conf","","7","2024-12"
"2024-12-18","Unemployment is lower, and, you know, in the SEP, you’ll see that participants think that the—that the downside risks are less and uncertainty is less.","Q&A","Press Conf","","25","2024-12"
"2024-12-18","Inflation is higher, as we talked about.","Q&A","Press Conf","","7","2024-12"
"2024-12-18","And—but then getting to your—to your point, there’s also, there’s uncertainty—uncertainty around inflation, I pointed out, is actually higher.","Q&A","Press Conf","","19","2024-12"
"2024-12-18","But some did identify policy uncertainty as one of the reasons for their, their writing down more uncertainty around inflation.","Q&A","Press Conf","","20","2024-12"
"2024-12-18","But, overall, you’re not getting inflationary impulses of any significance from the labor market.","Q&A","Press Conf","","14","2024-12"
"2024-12-18","And so what we’re doing in, in real time is we’re looking at our policy stance, and we’re looking at the way it’s hitting the economy, and, particularly, we look at the effects it’s having as we try to move the economy toward maximum employment and price stability.","Q&A","Press Conf","","48","2024-12"
"2024-12-18","Nonetheless, that is the job we have, and so we’re, we’re— I think we need— it’s appropriate for us—for us now to proceed cautiously, now that we’re 100 basis points closer to, to neutral, and we’ll do so.","Q&A","Press Conf","","38","2024-12"
"2024-12-18","Meanwhile, the economy seems to be in, in good shape, and these cuts will certainly help to support economic activity and the labor market while we can still make progress on inflation, because policy is still meaningfully restrictive.","Q&A","Press Conf","","38","2024-12"
"2024-12-18","So, and as, as I imagine you know, the, you know, the goal overall is headline inflation, because that’s what people experience.","Q&A","Press Conf","","22","2024-12"
"2024-12-18","So when we’re making monetary policy at the Fed, that’s not the question we’re asking.","Q&A","Press Conf","","15","2024-12"
"2024-12-18","First of all, when we, when we write— the thing we write down in the Summary of Economic Projections is the longer-run neutral rate, which is the neutral rate at a time when supply and demand are in balance, the full economy’s in balance, and no shocks are hitting the economy.","Q&A","Press Conf","","51","2024-12"
"2024-12-18","We, we’ve managed to, to have the unemployment rate remain essentially at its longer-run natural rate, while inflation has come down from—you know, core PCE inflation has come down from 5.6 percent to 2.8 percent on a 12-month basis.","Q&A","Press Conf","","39","2024-12"
"2024-12-18","One reason is that, that—just a technical issue around the way we calculate housing services, and that, that process has been slower than—market rents have, are showing up more slowly in that measure than we might have thought three, two, two years ago.","Q&A","Press Conf","","43","2024-12"
"2024-12-18","I think there are other, other parts of the story, but, you know, the, the—what, what I think people are feeling right now is the effect of high prices, not high inflation.","Q&A","Press Conf","","32","2024-12"
"2024-12-18","So we, we understand very well that prices went up by a great deal, and people really feel that.","Q&A","Press Conf","","19","2024-12"
"2024-12-18","So now we have—inflation itself is way down, but people are still feeling high prices, and that is—that is really what people are feeling.","Q&A","Press Conf","","24","2024-12"
"2024-12-18","The best we can do for them—and that’s who we work for—is to get inflation back down to its target and keep it there so that people are earning, you know, big, real wage increases so that their, their wages are going up, their, their compensation is going up faster than inflation year upon year upon year.","Q&A","Press Conf","","57","2024-12"
"2024-12-18","People don’t experience core inflation; they experience inflation, and that includes food and energy costs.","Q&A","Press Conf","","15","2024-12"
"2024-12-18","But, as we know, headline inflation contains energy and food, and those prices can fluctuate for reasons that are not related to tightness in the economy and therefore are not really good predictors of future inflation.","Q&A","Press Conf","","36","2024-12"
"2024-12-18","So it turns out that core inflation is, is a better predictor of overall inflation than overall inflation is.","Q&A","Press Conf","","19","2024-12"
"2024-12-18","And I don’t think that, you know, a, a couple of months of higher inflation really signal that, anything of the nature you’re suggesting.","Q&A","Press Conf","","24","2024-12"
"2024-12-18","And we’re kind of projecting that the same kinds of things are happening—so we, we keep a strong labor market, housing services inflation comes down, goods and services—goods inflation settles down, and, you know, nonmarket services return to their, their prior level.","Q&A","Press Conf","","42","2024-12"
"2024-12-18","And, you know, I think if you’d—if two, two years ago, you’d said, “we were [going to be] at 4.2 percent unemployment and 2.8 percent inflation,” people would be, would say, “I’ll take that.” I mean, that, that’s a pretty good interim place to be.","Q&A","Press Conf","","45","2024-12"
"2024-12-18","Job’s not done, but, but I think we’re, we’re feeling good about where we are and where we’re headed.","Q&A","Press Conf","","19","2024-12"
"2024-12-18","So we look at core inflation because it’s a better measure of what future inflation is like to be, likely to be, because it’s a better measure of, of","Q&A","Press Conf","","29","2024-12"
"2024-12-18","Yeah, so headline can, again, it can be affected by energy prices and food prices.","Q&A","Press Conf","","15","2024-12"
"2024-12-18","So that, there, there will be things in, in the headline forecasts that are to do with forecasts of energy prices, whereas core will be—if, if you look at core going out a full year, then it’ll be much more driven by things like tightness in the economy.","Q&A","Press Conf","","48","2024-12"
"2024-12-18","Headline has been lower, as you know, most of this year, but that’s because energy prices have been coming down, which is a great thing for people.","Q&A","Press Conf","","27","2024-12"
"2024-12-18","But energy prices will come down, and then they will go up, and it won’t really be telling us anything about how tight the economy is and how, how future inflation will perform.","Q&A","Press Conf","","33","2024-12"
"2024-12-18","The single thing that you would look to is the price of oil, given that we’re talking about the Middle East and Ukraine, and, you know, and—but that, that is a good summary statistic for the kind of thing that could go wrong in, in, with global turmoil.","Q&A","Press Conf","","48","2024-12"
"2024-12-18","But the price of oil’s been coming down, and, for, because of supply conditions, global supply conditions.","Q&A","Press Conf","","17","2024-12"
"2024-12-18","Yeah, so inflation—again, we don’t overreact to a couple of months of higher readings or a couple months of lower readings.","Q&A","Press Conf","","21","2024-12"
"2024-12-18","So I don’t really think the public is experiencing that as a surprising upside risk to inflation.","Q&A","Press Conf","","17","2024-12"
"2024-12-18","I, I think inflation is much lower.","Q&A","Press Conf","","7","2024-12"
"2024-12-18","What the public is feeling, and they’re right about it, is that prices are, are just—the price level went up, because of the past inflation.","Q&A","Press Conf","","25","2024-12"
"2024-12-18","And, in other words, your compensation’s growing meaningfully faster than inflation.","Q&A","Press Conf","","11","2024-12"
"2024-12-18","I think if you go back two or three years, many people were saying that to get this far down we would’ve had to have a, had a deep recession and, you know, high unemployment by now.","Q&A","Press Conf","","37","2024-12"
"2024-12-18","I think from now we are in a place where the risks really are in balance, and we need to see progress on inflation.","Q&A","Press Conf","","24","2024-12"
"2024-12-18","You know, for a while there we were only really focused mainly, mainly focused on, on inflation.","Q&A","Press Conf","","17","2024-12"
"2024-12-18","It’s real inflation, but it doesn’t portend persistently high inflation.","Q&A","Press Conf","","10","2024-12"
"2024-12-18","The, the unemployment rate has now—is now the same as it was in July: 4.2 percent.","Q&A","Press Conf","","16","2024-12"
"2024-12-18","And job creation is, is lower than it has been, but it’s been—it’s been steady—it’s not—it’s not declining.","Q&A","Press Conf","","18","2024-12"
"2024-12-18","It’s been steady at a level which, as I pointed out a couple times, is actually below the level that would hold the unemployment rate constant, but it’s not so far below.","Q&A","Press Conf","","32","2024-12"
"2024-12-18","So, you might—you might—if, if we have the, the breakeven level right, and if jobs continue—job creation continues at that level in the establishment survey, then you would get a tenth maybe every other month kind of thing.","Q&A","Press Conf","","38","2024-12"
"2024-12-18","We, we do think the labor market is still cooling by many measures, and we’re watching that closely.","Q&A","Press Conf","","18","2024-12"
"2024-12-18","So I—what I said is, we don’t think we need further softening to get to 2 percent inflation.","Q&A","Press Conf","","18","2024-12"
"2024-12-18","If, if you had a situation where inflation’s moving around by a tenth every few months, that’s, you know, we’d have to weigh that against the fact that inflation has in recent months been moving sideways in the 12-month window.","Q&A","Press Conf","","40","2024-12"
"2024-12-18","That’s, that’s meaningfully restrictive, and I, I think it’s a well-calibrated rate for us to continue to make progress on inflation while, while keeping a, a strong labor market.","Q&A","Press Conf","","29","2024-12"
"2024-12-18","What, what’s going on in the labor market is that the hiring rate is low.","Q&A","Press Conf","","15","2024-12"
"2024-12-18","So if you—if you have a job, you’re doing very well, and layoffs are very low, right?","Q&A","Press Conf","","17","2024-12"
"2024-12-18","So people are not losing their jobs in large numbers, unusually large numbers.","Q&A","Press Conf","","13","2024-12"
"2024-12-18","If you are looking for a job, though, the hiring rate is low, and that’s a signal of, of lower demand, and it has come the labor market.","Q&A","Press Conf","","28","2024-12"
"2024-12-18","Again, not something we need to see to get 2 percent inflation.","Q&A","Press Conf","","12","2024-12"
"2024-12-18","So, but you take a step back, the level of unemployment is very low—again, participation is high.","Q&A","Press Conf","","17","2024-12"
"2024-12-18","Wages are at a healthy and, and ever more sustainable level—wage growth.","Q&A","Press Conf","","12","2024-12"
"2024-12-18","And so the labor market—this is a good, a good labor market, and, you know, we want to keep it that way.","Q&A","Press Conf","","22","2024-12"
"2024-12-18","I, I will say that we think that, that our policy balances the risks—we think the risks are roughly in balance as between the two mandates, and we think the labor market is, is in solid shape.","Q&A","Press Conf","","37","2024-12"
"2024-12-18","You know, job creations are, are meaningfully positive; wages are, you know, if anything, a little, still a bit above what would be sustainable if productivity were to revert to its longer-run trend.","Q&A","Press Conf","","33","2024-12"
"2024-12-18","If you, if you take into account the high productivity readings we’ve had, then wages are already at a sustainable level relative to 2 percent inflation.","Q&A","Press Conf","","26","2024-12"
"2024-12-18","So, again, I, I don’t want to overstate the downside in the labor market, because the downsides clearly appear to have diminished.","Q&A","Press Conf","","22","2024-12"
"2024-12-18","PDFP, private domestic final purchases, which, which we think is the best indicator of private demand, is looking to come in around 3 percent [real growth] this year.","Q&A","Press Conf","","28","2024-12"
"2024-12-18","We, we’ve seen inflation—well, over the last couple of years—come down a lot.","Q&A","Press Conf","","13","2024-12"
"2024-12-18","We’ve seen the labor market cool off quite a bit.","Q&A","Press Conf","","10","2024-12"
"2024-12-18","I think growth this year has, has been solid, it really has.","Q&A","Press Conf","","12","2024-12"
