"2018-03-21","and the unemployment rate is going down,","Q&A","Press Conf","","7","2018-03"
"2018-03-21","So we’re paying rates that banks can get from other interest rates from other—any other investment in the short-term money markets.","Q&A","Press Conf","","21","2018-03"

"2018-03-21","participants believe there will be meaningful increases in demand from the new fiscal policies for at least the next,","Q&A","Press Conf","","19","2018-03"
"2018-03-21","which would drive—tend to drive productivity over time.","Q&A","Press Conf","","8","2018-03"
"2018-03-21","and investment should drive productivity.","Q&A","Press Conf","","5","2018-03"
"2018-03-21","They didn’t get into talking about particular—you know, whether it’s inflation or growth or whatever it would be.","Q&A","Press Conf","","18","2018-03"
"2018-03-21","we’ve had unemployment decline sharply since,","Q&A","Press Conf","","6","2018-03"
"2018-03-21","what wages should in theory represent is inflation plus productivity increases.","Q&A","Press Conf","","11","2018-03"

"2018-03-21","there is no—there’s no sense in the data that we’re on the cusp of an acceleration of inflation.","Q&A","Press Conf","","18","2018-03"
"2018-03-21","So, as—if inflation—if unemployment does continue to go down, we’ll continue to do that.","Q&A","Press Conf","","14","2018-03"
"2018-03-21","including wage inflation and price inflation.","Q&A","Press Conf","","6","2018-03"
"2018-03-21","they’re looking at a variety of aspects of the labor market,","Q&A","Press Conf","","11","2018-03"
"2018-03-21","As they see unemployment going lower,","Q&A","Press Conf","","6","2018-03"
"2018-03-21","the Committee’s median estimate of the natural rate of unemployment has also declined by a full percentage point.","Q&A","Press Conf","","18","2018-03"
"2018-03-21","So as the—as the actual unemployment rate has declined from 10 percent to 4.1 percent,","Q&A","Press Conf","","15","2018-03"
"2018-03-21","So I guess I’d start by saying that the natural rate of unemployment is not something that we can observe directly.","Q&A","Press Conf","","21","2018-03"
"2018-03-21","You know, I would say it’s hard to say, but it would take—you know, that is well above almost all estimates, current estimates of potential long-run growth.","Q&A","Press Conf","","27","2018-03"
"2018-03-21","We have seen moderate increases in wages and price inflation,","Q&A","Press Conf","","10","2018-03"
"2018-03-21","the potential growth rate of the economy are pinned down by slow- moving forces over time.","Q&A","Press Conf","","16","2018-03"
"2018-03-21","the natural rate of unemployment,","Q&A","Press Conf","","5","2018-03"
"2018-03-21","I guess the idea—the theory would be that if you get below the sustainable rate of unemployment for a sustained","Q&A","Press Conf","","20","2018-03"
"2018-03-21","we need to make sure that inflation expectations are anchored at 2 percent.","Q&A","Press Conf","","13","2018-03"
"2018-03-21","So I think when you see those small changes in unemployment,","Q&A","Press Conf","","11","2018-03"
"2018-03-21","And that suggests that the relationship between changes in slack and inflation is not so tight.","Q&A","Press Conf","","16","2018-03"
"2018-03-21","You’ve only seen very gradual upward pressures on inflation and wages despite that very large increase.","Q&A","Press Conf","","16","2018-03"
"2018-03-21","and there was a very slight increase in inflation.","Q&A","Press Conf","","9","2018-03"
"2018-03-21","the Committee’s estimates of unemployment went down,","Q&A","Press Conf","","7","2018-03"
"2018-03-21","The Committee’s estimates of growth went up,","Q&A","Press Conf","","7","2018-03"
"2018-03-21","the—what we’ve said in the longer-run statement of goals and monetary policy strategy is that we would be concerned with sustained or persistent deviations of inflation either above or below.","Q&A","Press Conf","","30","2018-03"
"2018-03-21","It just is that we’re always going to be seeking 2 percent unemployment from its goal.","Q&A","Press Conf","","16","2018-03"
"2018-03-21","So I do think it’s very important that we have a focus on productivity in the country.","Q&A","Press Conf","","17","2018-03"
"2018-03-21","I think in the tax bill there’s—there are incentives for—there—a tax cut bill that allows expensing of investments should encourage additional investment that should encourage productivity.","Q&A","Press Conf","","26","2018-03"
"2018-03-21","And, you know, you asked me about fiscal policy and the connection to productivity.","Q&A","Press Conf","","14","2018-03"
"2018-03-21","we’ve been through many years of growth around 2 percent,","Q&A","Press Conf","","10","2018-03"
"2018-03-21","I think it’s really important that we do something—do what we can as a country to increase our potential growth rate.","Q&A","Press Conf","","21","2018-03"
"2018-03-21","So we don’t know what the demand is for reserves in a world where you have—you know,","Q&A","Press Conf","","17","2018-03"
"2018-03-21","the size of the balance sheet is going to depend on the public’s demand for our liabilities,","Q&A","Press Conf","","17","2018-03"

"2019-08-23","A low neutral interest rate presents both near-term and longer-term challenges.","General","Speech","N/A","11","2019-08"
"2019-08-23","Nonetheless, in the unlikely event that signs of too-high inflation return, we have proven tools to address such a situation.","General","Speech","N/A","20","2019-08"
"2019-08-23","Inflation has averaged less than 2 percent over the past 25 years, and low inflation has been the main concern for the past decade.","General","Speech","N/A","24","2019-08"

"2019-08-23","The key question raised by this era, then, is how we can best support maximum employment and price stability in a world with a low neutral interest rate.","General","Speech","N/A","28","2019-08"
"2019-08-23","A lower r* combined with low inflation means that interest rates will run, on average, significantly closer to their effective lower bound.","General","Speech","N/A","22","2019-08"
"2019-08-23","The significant fall in r*, however, may demand more fundamental change.","General","Speech","N/A","11","2019-08"
"2019-08-23","Since 2012, declining unemployment has had surprisingly little effect on inflation, prompting a steady decline in estimates of u* (figure 3).11Standard estimates of r* have declined between 2 and 3 percentage points over the past two decades.","General","Speech","N/A","37","2019-08"

"2019-08-23","Moreover, while monetary policy is a powerful tool that works to support consumer spending, business investment, and public confidence, it cannot provide a settled rulebook for international trade.","General","Speech","N/A","28","2019-08"
"2019-08-23","In principle, anything that affects the outlook for employment and inflation could also affect the appropriate stance of monetary policy, and that could include uncertainty about trade policy.","General","Speech","N/A","28","2019-08"

"2019-09-18","The projection for real GDP growth over the medium term was a bit weaker than the previous forecast, primarily reflecting the effects of a higher projected path for the foreign exchange value of the dollar and a lower trajectory for economic growth abroad, which were partially offset by a lower assumed path for interest rates.","Staff Economic Outlook","Minutes","N/A","55","2019-09"
"2019-09-18","The projection for U.S. economic activity prepared by the staff for the September FOMC meeting was little changed in the near term; real GDP growth was still forecast to be slower in the second half of the year than in the first half, mostly attributable to continued soft business investment and a slower increase in government spending.","Staff Economic Outlook","Minutes","N/A","57","2019-09"

"2021-04-28","And we know that our job is to achieve 2 percent inflation over time.","Q&A","Press Conf","","14","2021-04"

"2021-04-28","the Committee seeks inflation moderately above inflation for two times—above 2 percent for some time.","Q&A","Press Conf","","15","2021-04"
"2021-04-28","With inflation having run persistently below 2 percent for some time,","Q&A","Press Conf","","11","2021-04"

"2021-04-28","equilibrium between labor supply and labor demand.","Q&A","Press Conf","","7","2021-04"
"2021-04-28","So I actually have a couple things I’d like to say about inflation,","Q&A","Press Conf","","13","2021-04"
"2021-04-28","So let me start with just saying that we’re very strongly committed to achieving our objectives of maximum employment and price stability.","Q&A","Press Conf","","22","2021-04"
"2021-04-28","and we believe that having inflation average 2 percent over time will help anchor long-term inflation expectations at 2 percent.","Q&A","Press Conf","","20","2021-04"
"2021-04-28","Twelve-month measures of inflation are likely to move well above 2 percent over the next few months as the very low inflation readings recorded in March and April of last year drop out of the calculation.","Q&A","Press Conf","","36","2021-04"
"2021-04-28","then we will use our tools to guide inflation and expectations back down to 2 percent.","Q&A","Press Conf","","16","2021-04"
"2021-04-28","It’s not one really good employment reading, which is what we got in March.","Q&A","Press Conf","","14","2021-04"
"2021-04-28","We got close to a million jobs in March and a very strong labor market reading.","Q&A","Press Conf","","16","2021-04"
"2021-04-28","I mean, there are always—there are always relative prices going up and down within inflation.","Q&A","Press Conf","","15","2021-04"
"2021-04-28","if we see inflation moving materially above 2 percent in a persistent way that risks inflation expectations drifting up,","Q&A","Press Conf","","19","2021-04"
"2021-04-28","and you’ll see it later this week in the PCE price data.","Q&A","Press Conf","","12","2021-04"
"2021-04-28","These base effects will contribute about 1 percentage point to headline inflation and about 0.7 percentage point to core inflation in April and May.","Q&A","Press Conf","","24","2021-04"
"2021-04-28","They carry no implication for the rate of inflation in later periods.","Q&A","Press Conf","","12","2021-04"

"2022-08-26","These lessons are guiding us as we use our tools to bring inflation down.","General","Speech","N/A","14","2022-08"
"2022-08-26","so part of the job of returning to a more stable and more productive economy must be to break the grip of inflationary expectations.","General","Speech","N/A","24","2022-08"
"2022-08-26","One useful insight into how actual inflation may affect expectations about its future path is based in the concept of ""rational inattention.","General","Speech","N/A","22","2022-08"

"2022-08-26","When inflation is low and stable, they are freer to focus their attention elsewhere.","General","Speech","N/A","14","2022-08"
"2022-08-26","Former Chairman Alan Greenspan put it this way: ""For all practical purposes, price stability means that expected changes in the average price level are small enough and gradual enough that they do not materially enter business and household financial decisions.","General","Speech","N/A","40","2022-08"

"2022-08-26","History shows that the employment costs of bringing down inflation are likely to increase with delay, as high inflation becomes more entrenched in wage and price setting.","General","Speech","N/A","27","2022-08"

"2022-11-30","Let's sum up this review of economic conditions that we think we need to see to bring inflation down to 2 percent.","General","Speech","N/A","22","2022-11"
"2022-11-30","This year, GDP was roughly flat through the first three quarters, and indicators point to modest growth this quarter, which seems likely to bring the year in with very modest growth overall.","General","Speech","N/A","32","2022-11"
"2022-11-30","To be clear, strong wage growth is a good thing.","General","Speech","N/A","10","2022-11"
"2022-11-30","But the declines are very modest so far relative to earlier increases and still leave wage growth well above levels consistent with 2 percent inflation over time.","General","Speech","N/A","27","2022-11"
"2022-11-30","Some measures of wage growth have ticked down recently (figure 6).","General","Speech","N/A","11","2022-11"
"2022-11-30","Job openings have fallen by about 1.5 million this year but remain higher than at any time before the pandemic.","General","Speech","N/A","20","2022-11"
"2022-11-30","But this job growth remains far in excess of the pace needed to accommodate population growth over time—about 100,000 per month by many estimates.","General","Speech","N/A","24","2022-11"
"2022-11-30","With slower GDP growth this year, job gains have stepped down from more than 450,000 per month over the first seven months of the year to about 290,000 per month over the past three months.","General","Speech","N/A","35","2022-11"
"2022-11-30","So far, we have seen only tentative signs of moderation of labor demand.","General","Speech","N/A","13","2022-11"
"2022-11-30","Currently, the unemployment rate is at 3.7 percent, near 50-year lows, and job openings exceed available workers by about 4 million—that is about 1.7 job openings for every person looking for work (figure 5).","General","Speech","N/A","34","2022-11"
"2022-11-30","For the near term, a moderation of labor demand growth will be required to restore balance to the labor market.","General","Speech","N/A","20","2022-11"
"2022-11-30","Without advocating any particular policy, however, I will say that policies to support labor force participation could, over time, bring benefits to the workers who join the labor force and support overall economic growth.","General","Speech","N/A","34","2022-11"
"2022-11-30","the timing of that moderation is far less significant than the questions of how much further we will need to raise rates to control inflation,","General","Speech","N/A","25","2022-11"
"2022-11-30","It is likely that restoring price stability will require holding policy at a restrictive level for some time.","General","Speech","N/A","18","2022-11"

"2022-11-30","We will stay the course until the job is done.","General","Speech","N/A","10","2022-11"
"2022-11-30","But for wage growth to be sustainable, it needs to be consistent with 2 percent inflation.","General","Speech","N/A","16","2022-11"
"2022-11-30","Indeed, a decline in this inflation underlies most forecasts of declining inflation.","General","Speech","N/A","12","2022-11"
"2022-11-30","But as long as new lease inflation keeps falling, we would expect housing services inflation to begin falling sometime next year.","General","Speech","N/A","21","2022-11"
"2022-11-30","As figure 3 shows, however, overall housing services inflation has continued to rise as existing leases turn over and jump in price to catch up with the higher level of rents for new leases.","General","Speech","N/A","34","2022-11"
"2022-11-30","Measures of 12-month inflation in new leases rose to nearly 20 percent during the pandemic but have been falling sharply since about midyear (figure 3).","General","Speech","N/A","25","2022-11"

"2022-11-30","It is far too early to declare goods inflation vanquished, but if current trends continue, goods prices should begin to exert downward pressure on overall inflation in coming months.","General","Speech","N/A","29","2022-11"
"2022-11-30","While 12-month core goods inflation remains elevated at 4.6 percent, it has fallen nearly 3 percentage points from earlier in the year.","General","Speech","N/A","22","2022-11"
"2022-11-30","Early in the pandemic, goods prices began rising rapidly, as abnormally strong demand was met by pandemic-hampered supply.","General","Speech","N/A","18","2022-11"

"2022-11-30","To assess what it will take to get inflation down, it is useful to break core inflation into three component categories: core goods inflation, housing services inflation, and inflation in core services other than housing (figure 2).","General","Speech","N/A","37","2022-11"
