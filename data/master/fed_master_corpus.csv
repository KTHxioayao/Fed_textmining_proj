"2018-03-21","You know, I think we’re trying to, we’re trying to be, to take the middle ground there. So, you know, on the one hand, the risk would be that we wait too really doesn’t get sustainably up to 2 percent, and, that will hurt us going forward. We need that, and it’s, you know, we need to make sure that inflation expectations are anchored at 2 percent. So we’re trying to take that middle ground, and the Committee continues to believe that the middle ground consists of further gradual increases in the federal funds rate as long as the economy is broadly on this path.","Q&A","Press Conf","","105","2018-03"
"2018-03-21","You know, so as you noted, the—what we’ve said in the longer-run statement of goals and monetary policy strategy is that we would be concerned with sustained or persistent deviations of inflation either above or below. We’ve also said—in minutes and in speeches and things like that—that that is a symmetric objective. So, that’s how we think of it. And, I think it’s—I wouldn’t characterize what we’ve done over the last five years as tolerating, you know, an undershoot of inflation. We were always pushing toward 2 percent, and I think that is how we look at it. I can’t give you an exact number. It just, you know, it, we haven’t agreed on that. It just is that we’re always going to be seeking 2 percent unemployment from its goal. And—and also, just the duration of it as well.","Q&A","Press Conf","","140","2018-03"
"2018-03-21","You know, let me say what that really is. So the Summary of Economic Projections is really a compilation of the individual rate forecasts. The Committee made really one decision at this meeting, and that was to raise the federal funds rate by 25 basis points. The Summary of Economic Projections is individual forecasts compiled and written down. And, you’ve identified the median as 2.7 percent. I would—and that’s an interesting statistic. I would also say that the central tendency is interesting. The full range is interesting. So you have a range of views around the table. One of the great benefits of our system is that we do have Reserve Banks with their own staffs and Governors with different views, and so we discuss these things. So the Committee doesn’t vote or agree upon the medians, so you’re going to have a range of views. That’s really all I can say—2.7 just happens to be the median for ’18, but it doesn’t really say, you know, what we think is possible.","Q&A","Press Conf","","172","2018-03"
"2018-03-21","You know, I would say it’s hard to say, but it would take—you know, that is well above almost all estimates, current estimates of potential long-run growth. It","Q&A","Press Conf","","28","2018-03"
"2018-03-21","So I guess I’d start by saying that the natural rate of unemployment is not something that we can observe directly. We look at a wide range of indicators on that—you know, 15 or 20 of them at least. And also, I think we all understand that any point estimate is surrounded by very wide uncertainty bands. So as the—as the actual unemployment rate has declined from 10 percent to 4.1 percent, the Committee’s median estimate of the natural rate of unemployment has also declined by a full percentage point. So the Committee—and, I think, people—are generally influenced by data. As they see unemployment going lower, they’re looking at a variety of aspects of the labor market, including wage inflation and price inflation. So I don’t think we, we—we’re mindful of the uncertainty of that, and we’ll be looking at that. So, as—if inflation—if unemployment does continue to go down, we’ll continue to do that. As I mentioned earlier, there is no—there’s no sense in the data that we’re on the cusp of an acceleration of inflation. We have seen moderate increases in wages and price inflation, and we seem to be seeing more of that. We’ll be alert to that. I guess the idea—the theory would be that if you get below the sustainable rate of unemployment for a sustained","Q&A","Press Conf","","221","2018-03"
"2018-03-21","Longer-run values like the neutral rate of interest, the natural rate of unemployment, the potential growth rate of the economy are pinned down by slow- moving forces over time. So they don’t—they don’t move around very much. So I wouldn’t expect the Committee’s, you know, predictions or projections or estimates of those values to move quickly. They’ll move slowly. So is it possible that the neutral rate of interest would move up because of, for example, greater fiscal expansion? There’s literature that says that. There’s—there are reasons that that might be the case. In fact, it did tick up one-tenth, as you all know, in the—in the median at this time. But it’s—I think, generally speaking, the Committee sees the neutral rate of interest as still quite low and is not—is not seeing it as having moved up and is open to the possibility that it will.","Q&A","Press Conf","","147","2018-03"
"2018-03-21","Ah, press conferences. So that’s something that I’m going to be carefully considering. I have not made a decision about it. My colleagues and I are committed to communicating as clearly as possible about what we’re doing and why we’re doing it. I would want to think very carefully about it and make sure that no one would take more","Q&A","Press Conf","","60","2018-03"
"2018-03-21","So, in terms of the balance sheet, we’ve said that, you know, we carefully developed this plan. We carefully socialized it in a series of meetings last year. We announced it, and we said we wouldn’t change it, really, unless there were a significant downturn that required, you know, meaningful reductions in interest rates. And I have no inclination to revisit that. We’re going to use monetary policy as the principle tool of adjusting, you know, our policy. So, on the second question, on tariffs, a number of participants in this FOMC did bring up the issue of tariffs, and if I could summarize what came out of that, it was, first, that there’s no thought, I think, that changes in trade policy should have any effect on the current outlook. Second thing is, I would say, is that a number of participants reported in—about their conversations with business leaders around the country and reported that trade policy has become a concern going forward for that group. members of the","Q&A","Press Conf","","170","2018-03"
"2018-03-21","So we look at the staff forecasts and the Board forecasts—and, by the way, there are 12 excellent Reserve Bank staffs who have their own views and do their own work—we look at those as informing the decisions of the policymakers. So—and it’s really the policymakers’ views that we talk about in the","Q&A","Press Conf","","53","2018-03"
"2018-03-21","I would go back to the thought that, you know, we made one decision at this meeting, and that decision was to raise the federal funds rate by 25 basis points. The projections are really just individual projections that are submitted and then compiled. And, you know, you’re mentioning the median as being, you know, three and four being close, but, you know, I think, like any set of forecasts, those forecasts will change over time, and they’ll change depending on the way the outlook for the economy changes. So that’s really all I can say. It could change up. It could change down. I wouldn’t want to—for now, these are the best forecasts that people could make, and, you know, it could be that if the economy’s a little bit stronger or a little bit weaker, then the path could be a little less gradual or a little more gradual.","Q&A","Press Conf","","151","2018-03"
"2018-03-21","You know, I would say that—remember that forecasts three years out—so, you’re right, in 2020 there’s a—I think it’s 3.4 percent is the median of the SEP dots for 2020, which is 40 basis points above the estimates of the neutral rate, which I would characterize as, you know, modestly restrictive, modestly tightening policy, but that’s three years in the future. It’s highly uncertain. You know, we don’t have the ability to see that far into the future, so I really wouldn’t put a lot in that. It could make sense. You could imagine narratives in which that would make sense, but I honestly I wouldn’t put too much on that. Sorry, your second question was?","Q&A","Press Conf","","116","2018-03"
"2018-03-21","You know, we’ve been through many years of growth around 2 percent, and I’ve given a number of public remarks where I’ve called on, you know, the country to focus more on potential growth and productivity and labor force participation, which drive potential growth. So, you know, I think it’s really important that we do something—do what we can as a country to increase our potential growth rate. I would say in the bill that passed Congress, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, there were elements that should encourage productivity, as I mentioned—sorry, encourage investment, which should help productivity, encourage labor force participation. We don’t know how big those effects are going to be. We don’t know what will be large.","Q&A","Press Conf","","121","2018-03"
"2018-03-21","Sure. Our current framework for implementing monetary policy is working very well. We have excellent control over rates, and it’s working. And it’s— you described it accurately. We haven’t made a decision to keep that as our longer-run framework. We haven’t really addressed that question. We’ve had meetings where we’ve talked about it, and we’ve agreed that it’s working well. But it’s—and it’s not something I see us as needing to urgently address. I think we’re continuing to learn about this framework. For example, one—in the long-run, the size of the balance sheet is going to depend on the public’s demand for our liabilities, including currency and reserves. So we don’t know what the demand is for reserves in a world where you have—you know, you have regulations that require banks to hold lots of high-quality liquid assets, and reserves are one of those. So it’s not something we’re looking at resolving in the near term. pay interest on excess reserves that are—is above the general level of short-term interest rates. So we’re paying rates that banks can get from other interest rates from other—any other investment in the short-term money markets. In addition, remember that those liabilities—those are our liabilities. The assets that we have on the other side are Treasury securities and mortgage-backed securities, which yield much higher than interest on reserves. So, in fact, it’s not a subsidy, and it’s not a cost to the taxpayer.","Q&A","Press Conf","","239","2018-03"
"2018-03-21","Since the financial crisis, we’ve been monitoring financial conditions and financial stability issues very carefully, and the FOMC receives regular briefings about the staff framework and, sort of, measures of various aspects of financial—financial stability risks, and the current view of the Committee is that financial stability vulnerabilities are moderate, let’s say. And I’ll go through a couple of pieces of that. So, if you look at the banking system, particularly the large financial institutions, you see higher capital. You see much higher liquidity. You see them more aware of their risks and better able to manage them with stress testing. And if one—if something does go wrong, you’ve got—you’ve got better ability to deal with the failure of those institutions. So, therefore, you don’t see high leverage. You don’t see excess risk-taking in great quantity the way you did see levels of borrowing, but nothing that suggests, you know, serious risks. And, of course, default rates are very low. So those readings look okay. I should mention also that for large financial institutions, they’re no longer funded by a lot of short-term wholesale funding, which can disappear very quickly, so they’re far less vulnerable to liquidity issues. Overall, those aspects, I think, suggest low levels of vulnerability. You identified the—really, one area where—which is an area of focus, which is asset prices. So, in some areas, asset prices are elevated relative to their longer-run historical norms. You can think of some equity prices. You can think of commercial real estate prices in certain markets. But we don’t see it in housing, which is key. And so, overall, if you put all of that into a pie, what you have is moderate vulnerabilities, in our view. In terms of whether we have the tools, you know, we have some tools, and I think we certainly—we use them. We have—I think the stress test is a really important tool that we have for the largest financial institutions and for the smaller financial institutions. We regularly use that to—as a way to test against various, you know, market shocks, certainly for the larger institutions.","Q&A","Press Conf","","352","2018-03"
"2018-03-21","Okay. So, this is a matter that Congress has under consideration. It’s not something—so Congress is looking at raising the threshold for applying enhanced financial standards to—from $50 billion to $250 billion, while leaving us with the ability to reach below $250 billion and apply those standards where we think it’s appropriate. And, you know, we haven’t been shy about doing that, because, of course, one of the eight SIFIs is below 250 already. So we are fully prepared to do that. But this is a decision that’s in the hands of Congress. It’s not something that’s been—been taken. The version of the bill, I think, that passed the Senate did have—did give us the ability to do supervisory stress tests periodically, as opposed to annually, is the language. We haven’t made any decision about that at all. We would want to think very carefully about that, and, you know, we would—whatever we do decide to do, we’d put that out for comment. Is it, you know, logistically possible? I would think it would be, but it’s certainly not something that we’ve decided to do. And the second question you had was?","Q&A","Press Conf","","192","2018-03"
"2018-03-21","Sure. Well, it’s—I guess the next thing on the list would be activities. So, you know, we—regular way commercial banks that do deposit taking and lending and don’t speculate in markets, you know, that’s one business model. Another business model might be, you know, if you think of a hedge fund, right? That’s what they do. They’re speculating on markets, and—you know, so very different business models and different levels of risk and that sort of thing. So, that’s—that would be the next thing on the list. I mean, there","Q&A","Press Conf","","90","2018-03"
"2018-03-21","Remember that there are 15 FOMC participants, and we—each of us has his or her own forecast. So there’s a real diversity of views on this, particularly on these fiscal issues. If I could try to summarize, it would be that, I think, broadly speaking, participants believe there will be meaningful increases in demand from the new fiscal policies for at least the next, let’s say, three years. I think there’s a general view as well that supply-side issues—that there could be supply-side effects as well, and you would see that again through higher investment, driven by lower corporate tax rates and the expensing of some investment, which would drive—tend to drive productivity over time. If you make investment more attractive, companies should do more of it. It’s uncertain, though. I mean, I spent many years of my life working with companies and discussing—and, you know, the cost of capital is one of many factors that they’ll consider. It isn’t the only factor or the principle factor, but it should result in more investment, and investment should drive productivity. At the same time, the—you know, I mentioned labor supply. You should see some labor supply effects over time from lower individual effective tax rates. The whole thing is very know, we’ve all looked at the literature carefully. We’ve all thought about it. We’ve discussed it with our in-house experts and come up with our own views, and they’re disparate, but that’s— I’d say that’s about where the—where the views are.","Q&A","Press Conf","","250","2018-03"
"2018-03-21","You know, at this stage, what our FOMC participants discussed—it wasn’t—it was—it was just that this is a new risk that had been probably a low- profile risk, which has become, you know, a more prominent risk to the outlook. That’s really what people were saying. They didn’t get into talking about particular—you know, whether it’s inflation or growth or whatever it would be. So that’s not something that did come up. You know—your second question, sorry, was China?","Q&A","Press Conf","","79","2018-03"
"2018-03-21","As I mentioned, you know, we’ve had unemployment decline sharply since, I guess, 2010, when it peaked at 10 percent and down to 4.1 percent now, and we’ve seen only modest increases in wages. So, on the one hand, what wages should in theory represent is inflation plus productivity increases. You should get paid for your productivity plus inflation. And productivity’s been very low. Inflation’s been low. So these low wage increases—in a sense, they do make sense in that—from that perspective. On the other hand, as the market has tightened, as labor markets have tightened, and we hear reports of labor shortages and we see that, you know, groups of unemployed are diminishing, and the unemployment rate is going down, we haven’t seen, you know, higher wages—wages going up more. And I would—I think I’ve been surprised by that, and I think others have as well. In terms of what’s the right level, I don’t think I have a view on what the right level of wages is, but I think we will—we will know that the labor market is getting tight when we do see a more meaningful upward move in wages.","Q&A","Press Conf","","194","2018-03"
"2018-03-21","No. That doesn’t keep me awake at night. We don’t consider the election cycle. You know, we—we’re looking very carefully at our assigned responsibilities of maximum employment, stable prices, and that’s really our focus. You can count on us to stay focused on the jobs that Congress has assigned us and count on us to use the tools we have to achieve them. You’re right, that’s the highest rate. By the way, I’m hearing this, the 10-year thing a few times these days, and it’s true that rates are higher than they’ve been in 10 years. On the other hand, the economy’s healthier than it’s been since—since before the financial crisis. So, it’s a healthier economy than it’s been in 10 years. The financial crisis, of course, was just really getting going 10 years ago.","Q&A","Press Conf","","135","2018-03"
"2018-03-21","You know, it’s an interesting question, and there are a range of views there. I think it’s true that yield curves have tended to predict recessions if you look back over many cycles, but a lot of that was just situations in which inflation was allowed to get out of control, and the Fed had to tighten, and that put the economy into a recession. That’s really not the situation we’re in now, so I don’t know that that’s—I don’t know that—I don’t think that inverted yield curve does to intermediation. It’s hard to find in the research data, but nonetheless, I think those are issues that we’ll be watching carefully. Thank you very much.","Q&A","Press Conf","","115","2018-03"
"2018-03-21","So, you’re right that the outlook did improve, as I mentioned and as you—as was in your question. The Committee’s estimates of growth went up, the Committee’s estimates of unemployment went down, and there was a very slight increase in inflation. And I think that reflects, essentially—if you think back to the era after the crisis, unemployment was 10 percent. It’s now 4.1 percent. You’ve only seen very gradual upward pressures on inflation and wages despite that very large increase. And that suggests that the relationship between changes in slack and inflation is not so tight. But, it has diminished, but it’s still there. So I think when you see those small changes in unemployment, that simply reflects the, you know, the flatness of the Phillips curve, if you will.","Q&A","Press Conf","","130","2018-03"
"2018-03-21","You know, for trade, what I mentioned is that our FOMC participants reported in that they had heard, you know, concerns, which were relatively new, about—about future trade actions, really. And they’re seeing it as a risk-to-the-outlook kind of thing. So—and the kind of things people are talking about would be, you know, more widespread retaliation and more widespread actions back-and-forth kind of thing. I can’t be any more specific than that. In terms of productivity—productivity, as I’m sure you know, has been very weak since the financial crisis. It’s averaged only about 0.5 percent a year for the last six years, I guess. So that’s well below, you know, longer-run averages, and it would certainly be a good thing to see it move up. It has moved up just a little bit but not, kind of, decisively. And, you know, you asked me about fiscal policy and the connection to productivity. I think in the tax bill there’s—there are incentives for—there—a tax cut bill that allows expensing of investments should encourage additional investment that should encourage productivity. In theory, an individual tax bill that lowers tax rates should encourage more labor force participation. So I do think it’s very important that we have a focus on productivity in the country. It’s not something that we can really do at the Fed, but, you know, we’re certainly hopeful that there will be supply-side effects like that from the tax bill. I think estimates are really all over the place in terms of the amount and the timing of those.","Q&A","Press Conf","","259","2018-03"
"2018-03-21","Well, the—you’re right. So fiscal stimulus is a, you know, a meaningful input into, you know, into the SEP and particularly in the changes over the course of last year and this year. And individual policymakers went through, with their staffs, a range of estimates, a range of literature, and did their own thinking and came up with their own estimates and submitted those as their Summary of Economic Projections—as their projections. Those are not the staff’s projections. Those are our projections. appropriate, but clearly something was holding a number of the FOMC members back. Is it concerns about these potential trade tariffs that are going into effect? Is it just that people want to wait and see a little longer before they raise? Can you give us some more insight into why people didn’t go to four this time—the median—even though the economic projections look very healthy?","Q&A","Press Conf","","148","2018-03"

"2018-05-08","The trilemma does not say that a flexible exchange rate will always fully insulate domestic economic conditions from external shocks.1And, indeed, that is not the case.","General","Speech","N/A","26","2018-05"
"2018-05-08","We have seen that integration of global capital markets can make for difficult tradeoffs for some economies, whether they have fixed or floating exchange rate regimes.","General","Speech","N/A","26","2018-05"
"2018-05-08","Since the Fed is the central bank of the world's largest economy and issuer of the world's most widely used reserve currency, it is to be expected that the Fed's policy actions will spill over to other economies.","General","Speech","N/A","38","2018-05"
"2018-05-08","To illustrate this point, the scatterplot on the left side offigure 1focuses on movements in interest rates and exchange rates following Federal Reserve policy announcements.","General","Speech","N/A","25","2018-05"
"2018-05-08","As you can see, changes in U.S. interest rates after Fed policy actions (shown on the horizontal axis) lead to corresponding changes in the value of the dollar (shown on the vertical axis).","General","Speech","N/A","33","2018-05"
"2018-05-08","And because of the dollar's widespread use around the world, these changes in the dollar affect financial conditions abroad.","General","Speech","N/A","19","2018-05"
"2018-05-08","Fed policy-related movements in U.S. bond yields also tend to spill over to bond yields abroad, such as the German yields shown in the scatterplot on the right.","General","Speech","N/A","28","2018-05"
"2018-05-08","Such spillovers are to be expected in a world of highly integrated financial markets.2Asfigure 2shows, bond yields (left) and equity prices (right) around the world typically move together fairly closely.","General","Speech","N/A","30","2018-05"
"2018-05-08","In fact, the United States is the recipient as well as the originator of monetary policy spillovers.","General","Speech","N/A","17","2018-05"
"2018-05-08","The Federal Reserve is not the only central bank whose actions affect global financial markets.","General","Speech","N/A","15","2018-05"
"2018-05-08","And while financial globalization does pose some challenges for monetary policy, efforts to build stronger and more transparent policy frameworks and a more resilient financial system can reduce the adverse consequences of external shocks.","General","Speech","N/A","34","2018-05"
"2018-05-08","For example, as seen infigure 3, changes in German yields after European Central Bank policy decisions also pass through to U.S. yields.3More broadly, it is notable that although the Fed has raised its target interest rate six times since December 2015 and has begun to shrink its balance sheet, overall U.S. domestic financial conditions have gotten looser, in part due to improving global conditions and central bank policy abroad.","General","Speech","N/A","69","2018-05"
"2018-05-08","Much of the discussion of the spillovers of U.S. monetary policy focuses on their effects on financial conditions in emerging market economies (EMEs).","General","Speech","N/A","23","2018-05"
"2018-05-08","Some observers have attributed the movements in international capital flowing to EMEs since the Global Financial Crisis primarily to monetary stimulus by the Fed and other advanced-economy central banks.4The data do not seem to me to fit this narrative particularly well.","General","Speech","N/A","41","2018-05"
"2018-05-08","As illustrated by the blue dashed line in the left panel offigure 4, capital flows to EMEs were already very strong before the Global Financial Crisis, when the federal funds rate was comparatively high.","General","Speech","N/A","34","2018-05"
"2018-05-08","The subsequent surge in capital flows in 2009, as the crisis was abating, largely reflects a rebound from the capital flow interruption during the crisis itself, though highly accommodative monetary policies in advanced economies doubtless also played a role.","General","Speech","N/A","39","2018-05"
"2018-05-08","Moreover, capital flows to EMEs started to ease after 2011, a period when the Federal Reserve continued to add accommodation and reduce yields through increases in its balance sheet, as shown in the right panel.","General","Speech","N/A","35","2018-05"
"2018-05-08","But the influence of U.S. monetary policy on global financial conditions should not be overstated.","General","Speech","N/A","15","2018-05"
"2018-05-08","To preview my conclusions, I will argue that, while global factors play an important role in influencing domestic financial conditions, the role of U.S. monetary policy is often exaggerated.","General","Speech","N/A","29","2018-05"

"2018-06-13","Sure. So since—I wouldn’t say anything has happened since March to really change the way I’m thinking about inflation or the way the Committee’s thinking about inflation. We’ve seen inflation move very gradually up toward our 2 percent objective. And part of that has been just idiosyncratic things dropping out from last March, which were holding inflation—measured inflation—down. Part of it is just that continued tightening in the labor market and the economy more broadly is pushing inflation up. So we continue to think, and the Committee continues to think, that we are just about at our 2 percent goal but, as I mentioned, not ready to declare victory until we sustain that over time, which we haven’t done yet. You also asked about fiscal policy, and there’s a range of views on the Committee and, I think more broadly, a range of views among economists generally. But I can say that the Committee members—Committee participants—generally believe that the fiscal changes—and that includes both the tax cuts, individual and corporate, and the spending changes—will provide meaningful support to demand, significant support to demand over the course of the next three years. And the question—the other question is, what about the supply side? So it is—it makes sense that if you lower corporate tax rates and allow faster expensing of investment, you will encourage greater investment. That should drive productivity. That should increase potential output. So that really ought to happen as well. I think the amounts and the timing of that coming in are also quite uncertain. There’s also the possibility that there would be more labor supply from lower individual tax rates, again, in amounts and in timing that might be more uncertain. So that’s how the Committee generally is thinking about—about fiscal policy. considered a neutral fed funds rate. And I wanted to ask how you’re thinking about what to do once you get to neutral. Under what conditions would you decide, once you get there, that it’s okay to stop raising rates? And under what conditions would you want to keep going?","Q&A","Press Conf","","345","2018-06"
"2018-06-13","Good afternoon. Thanks very much for being here. I know that a number of you will want to talk about the details of our announcement today, and I am happy to do that in a few minutes. But because monetary policy affects everyone, I want to start with a plain-English summary of how the economy is doing, what my colleagues and I at the Federal Reserve are trying to do, and why. The main takeaway is that the economy is doing very well. Most people who want to find jobs are finding them, and unemployment and inflation are low. Interest rates have been low for some years while the economy has been recovering from the financial crisis. For the past few years, we have been gradually raising interest rates, and along the way we’ve tried to explain the reasoning behind our decisions. In particular, we think that gradually returning interest rates to a more normal level as the economy strengthens is the best way the Fed can help sustain an environment in which American households and businesses can thrive. Today, we’ve taken another step in that process by raising our target range for the federal funds rate by ¼ of a percentage point. My colleagues and I meet eight times a year and take a fresh look each time at what is happening in the economy and consider whether our policy needs adjusting. We don’t put our interest rate decisions on hold or on autopilot, because the economy can always evolve in unexpected ways. History has shown that moving interest rates either too quickly or too slowly can lead to bad economic outcomes. We think the outcomes are likely to be better overall if we are as clear as possible about what we are likely to do and why. To that end, we try to give a sense of our expectations for how the economy will evolve and how our policy stance may change. conference like this after every one of our scheduled FOMC meetings. And we’re going to do that beginning in January. That will give us more opportunities to explain our actions and to answer your questions. I want to point out that having twice as many press conferences does not signal anything about the timing or pace of future interest rate changes. This change is only about improving communications. My FOMC colleagues and I will also continue to issue our economic projections on the existing quarterly schedule. Now, let me go into more detail over developments in the economy, our economic projections, and our policy decision. Economic growth appears to have picked up in the current quarter, largely reflecting a bounceback in household spending. Business investment continues to grow strongly, and the overall outlook for growth remains favorable. Several factors support this assessment: Fiscal policy is boosting the economy, ongoing job gains are raising incomes and confidence, foreign economies continue to expand, and overall financial conditions remain accommodative. These observations are consistent with the projections that Committee participants submitted for this meeting. The median projection for the growth of real GDP is 2.8 percent this year, 2.4 percent next year, and 2 percent in 2020. Compared with the projections made in March, this median growth path is little changed. In the labor market, job gains averaged 180,000 per month over the past three months, well above the pace needed in the longer run to provide jobs for new entrants into the workforce. The unemployment rate declined over the past two months and stood at 3.8 percent in May, its lowest level in nearly two decades. Meanwhile, the labor force participation rate has been roughly unchanged since late 2013. That is a positive sign, given that the aging of our Committee participants’ projections for the unemployment rate stands at 3.6 percent in the fourth quarter of this year and runs at 3.5 percent over the next two years, a percentage point below the median estimate of its longer-run normal rate. This median path is just a bit lower than that from March. After many years of running below our 2 percent longer-run objective, inflation has recently moved close to that level. Indeed, overall consumer prices, as measured by the price index for personal consumption expenditures, increased 2 percent over the 12 months ending in April. The core PCE index, which excludes prices of energy and food and tends to be a better indicator of future inflation, rose 1.8 percent over the same period. As we had expected, inflation moved up as the unusually low readings from last March dropped out of the calculation. The recent inflation data have been encouraging, but after many years of inflation below our objective, we do not want to declare victory. We want to ensure that inflation remains near our symmetric 2 percent longer-run goal on a sustained basis. As we note in our Statement of Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, the Committee would be concerned if inflation were running persistently above or below our 2 percent objective. Of course, many factors affect inflation—some temporary and others more lasting—and at any given time inflation may be above or below 2 percent. For example, the recent rise in oil prices will likely push inflation somewhat above 2 percent in coming months. But that transitory development should have little, if any, consequence for inflation over the next few years. The median of participants’ projections for inflation runs at 2.1 percent through 2020. Relative to the March projections, the median inflation projection is a little higher this year and next. bringing it to 1¾ to 2 percent. We also made some changes to our policy statement, reflecting that policy normalization is proceeding broadly as we have expected. None of these changes signals a change in our policy views. For example, we removed the language stating that “the federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run.” Since we introduced that language a few years ago, the economy has strengthened, and the Committee has raised the federal funds rate from near 0 to 1¾ to 2 percent. As we continue to note in our statement, we expect to make further gradual increases in that rate. As a result, if the economy evolves broadly as we anticipate, the federal funds rate will, over the next year or so, move well within the range of estimates of the normal long-run level. Therefore, we thought that now is an appropriate time to remove this forward guidance from our policy statement. We continue to believe that a gradual approach for increasing the federal funds rate will best promote a sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near our symmetric 2 percent goal. We are aware that raising rates too slowly might raise the risk that monetary policy would need to tighten abruptly down the road in response to an unexpectedly sharp increase in inflation or financial excesses, jeopardizing the economic expansion. Conversely, if we raise interest rates too rapidly, the economy could weaken, and inflation could continue to run persistently below our objective. The Committee’s gradual approach is reflected in participants’ projections for the appropriate path for the federal funds rate. The median projection for the federal funds rate is 2.4 percent at the end of this year, 3.1 percent at the end of 2019, and 3.4 percent at the end of rate edged up this year and next, most participants did not revise their projections. I’ll conclude by mentioning two additional matters. First, our program for reducing our balance sheet, which began in October, is proceeding smoothly. Barring a material and unexpected weakening in the outlook, this program will proceed on schedule, and our balance sheet will continue to shrink. As we have said, changing the target range for the federal funds rate is our primary means of adjusting the stance of monetary policy. And, finally, as discussed in the minutes of our May meeting, we’re making a small technical adjustment in one of our tools for implementing monetary policy. To keep the federal funds rate in the target range, we rely on the rate of interest on excess reserves, or the IOER rate. Up until now, we have set the IOER rate at the top of the target range for the federal funds rate. In recent months, the federal funds rate has moved up toward the IOER rate as short-term interest rates have risen more generally. So to move the federal funds rate closer to the middle of the target range, we are now setting the IOER rate 5 basis points below the upper end of the target range. This minor technical adjustment has no bearing on the appropriate path for the federal funds rate or financial conditions more generally. Thanks for listening, and I’ll be","Opening Statement","Press Conf","","1474","2018-06"

And I—you have a range of views. It’s something we’re going to continue to be talking about. It’s—but it’s only one of many things, of course, that we talk about. I think that that discussion is really about what is appropriate policy, and how do we think about policy as we approach the neutral rate. How do we understand what the neutral rate is? How do we know where it is? And what are the consequences of being above or below it? That’s really what—when people are talking about the slope of the yield curve, that’s really what they’re talking about. We know why—we know why the yield curve is flattening. It’s because we’re raising the federal funds rate. It makes all the sense in the world that the short end would come up. I think you asked—the harder question is, what’s happening with long rates? And there are many things that move long rates around. Of course, there’s an embedded expectation of the path of short rates. There’s the term premium, which has been very low by historical standards. And so arguments are made that a flatter yield curve has less of a signal embedded in it. In 1 Chairman Powell intended to say that there are pockets of people in the United States who have not yet experienced the economic recovery. Treasury prices go up, rates go down quite a lot. So—but I think ultimately, you know, what we’re—what we really care about is what’s the appropriate stance of policy. And there’s a— there may be a signal in that long-term rate about what is the neutral rate, and I think that’s why people are paying attention to the yield curve.","Q&A","Press Conf","","310","2018-06"
"2018-06-13","So I would just point you to the range of estimates at the Committee, which I think is 2¼ to 3½, and the median is 2.9, right in there. So that’s the range of estimates of the nominal neutral rate of interest. And we do understand that there’s high uncertainty around the level, but that’s kind of—so you can think of 2.9 as being—which is sort of a full percentage point away from where fed funds is going to trade after today’s decision. You asked, is the—is the neutral rate moving up because of fiscal policy? Yes. I mean, there’s—there should be an effect if you have increased deficits that should put upward pressure on, you know, a few tenths, let’s say. Again, though, they were estimating these things. It’s one we know? Well, I think you have to look at inflation. You’ve got to look at—you’ve got to look at all of the indicators in the economy and look at inflation, look at unemployment, look at what’s happening in the job market. And inflation is really important. It’s worth noting that the last two business cycles didn’t end with high inflation—they ended with financial instability—so that’s something we need to also keep our eye on.","Q&A","Press Conf","","206","2018-06"
"2018-06-13","You know, I would say that the economy is in great shape. If you look at household surveys, confidence is high. Look at businesses, confidence is high. If you ask—if you survey workers about the job market, they’ll say that it’s a really good doing is, we are trying to conduct monetary policy in a way that will sustain that expansion, keep the labor markets strong, and keep inflation above—right at—sorry, not above, but right at 2 percent. That’s really what we’re trying to do and, you know, I would say I like the results so far. We’re—we’ve been very, very careful not to tighten too quickly. I think we’ve been patient. I think that patience has borne fruit and I think it continues to. We had a lot of encouragement to go much faster and I’m really glad we didn’t. But, at this time, the— continuing on that gradual pace seems—continues to seem like the right thing. If we get a sense that the economy is reacting badly, then we’ll certainly react to that.","Q&A","Press Conf","","175","2018-06"
"2018-06-13","So the countercyclical capital buffer gives us the ability to raise capital requirements on the largest institutions when financial stability vulnerabilities are meaningfully above normal. That’s the language that we’ve used. And that’s certainly a possibility. I wouldn’t say that—I wouldn't look at today’s financial stability landscape and say down their debt, incomes are rising, people have jobs. So households are not really a concern. And banks are highly capitalized, so that’s not really a concern. We see—there’s some concern with asset prices in a couple of pockets. But overall, if you—if you bake it all in, I think we see, generally, financial vulnerabilities as moderate. Could that change, you asked, over a couple of years? Yeah, it could. You also asked about marijuana businesses. So this is a very difficult area because we have state law—many state laws permit the use of marijuana and federal law still doesn’t. So it puts, you know, federally chartered banks in a very difficult situation. I think it would be great if that could be clarified. We don’t have—you know, it puts the supervisor in a very, very difficult position. And, of course, this isn’t our—our mandate has nothing to do with marijuana, so we don’t really—we just would love to see it clarified, I think.","Q&A","Press Conf","","213","2018-06"
"2018-06-13","So for many, many years, we’ve been far from maximum employment and stable prices, and so the need for accommodative policy has been—has been clear. As the economy has strengthened and as we’ve gradually raised interest rates, the question comes into view of, how much longer will you need to be accommodative? And how will you know? How will you know where—at what point policy will be neutral? Neutral meaning that interest rates are neither pushing the economy up nor trying to restrain it. So we know that we’re getting closer to that neutral level. We don’t have an exact sense of how that will be. So the Committee is discussing, very actively, the questions that you raise. And, really, it boils down to a question of, what is appropriate policy? And, you know, I—you asked, how will we know? So I think we’ll be very carefully looking at incoming data on inflation, on financial readings, and on the labor market. We have to acknowledge that there are always wide uncertainty bands around the level of, for example, the natural rate of unemployment. But also, what is the neutral rate of interest? What is that rate of interest that pushes neither up nor down? So I think we— we’ll be guided by incoming data on the economy and try to keep our minds open as we move forward.","Q&A","Press Conf","","228","2018-06"
"2018-06-13","So it doesn’t play any part in my thinking and I’ll tell you why. If you raise rates too quickly, you’re just increasing the likelihood of a recession, and that’s exactly what you don’t want to do. So the best thing you can do, I think—I think the incentives actually run in the other direction. If you’re—if you’re worried about going back to the lower bound, then risk management would suggest that you go a little slower in raising rates and tolerate—that’s likely to be a more sustainable strategy to get further away from the zero lower bound. I think we’re far enough away now, though, that the risks are kind of balanced. And so I think it’s more just—we’re just looking at the economy, and what does it need, and how do we— how do we sustain the expansion, keep the labor market strong, and try to keep inflation near 2 percent?","Q&A","Press Conf","","153","2018-06"
"2018-06-13","You know, the—our target for—our medium-term objective for inflation is 2 percent PCE inflation. We feel that that target has served the economy well, and I’m strongly committed to it. The Committee is strongly committed to it. The sort of barriers to making a material change to that would be—would be very high because, again, we think it’s fundamental, and we think it’s worked. You asked about price-level targeting and that sort of thing. You know, there are some ideas that sort of take cognizance of the fact that rates are lower, we’re near the zero lower bound, and that could put downward pressure on inflation expectations if we’re going to be down at the zero lower bound and, therefore, sort of undermine the credibility of the 2 percent inflation objective. So the idea is to have kind of a makeup. If you—if you’re below target for a while, you have a—you have a time of being above target. And the idea is to enhance the credibility of that 2 percent—that 2 percent target. This is an idea that’s been written about for many years. It’s not something that the Committee has looked at seriously. I imagine we will be having discussions about it, but—not something that we have on the calendar right now.","Q&A","Press Conf","","214","2018-06"
"2018-06-13","You know, first of all, that’s a—that’s a reasonable range, I think, of—it’s not that we’re all on the same number, but there are a range of views about potential growth. And there’s so much uncertainty around this. You know, we don’t—the thing about fiscal policy is, you don’t have thousands of incidents to, you know, to—you don’t have But I think our approach is going to be to watch and see and hope that, in fact, we do get significant effects to, you know, to potential growth out of the tax bill, and we’re just going to have to see.","Q&A","Press Conf","","101","2018-06"

"2018-06-13","You know, what we’ve said in our Statement of Longer-Run Principles and Monetary Policy Strategy is that the Committee would be concerned if inflation were to run persistently above or below 2 percent, persistently above or below 2 percent. And that’s what we mean by symmetric. We’re looking at it equally on either side and it’s a matter of persistent overruns. We know that inflation is going to bounce around. For example, as I mentioned, later this summer there’s a good chance that headline inflation will move up above we would be using our tools to try to move inflation back in the direction of the target. We do understand, though, that we don’t have the ability to precisely hit that target, so we expect that inflation will be above or below. And we just hope that that is—happens on a symmetric basis.","Q&A","Press Conf","","143","2018-06"
"2018-06-13","So if you look at households, you do not see excess credit growth, you don’t see high levels of credit going out. So not so much households. And that really was where the problems were before the financial crisis, was particularly in—among household borrowing, particularly around mortgages. With—if you take banks, then, of course, their leverage is significantly lower. Or, to say it differently, their capital is significantly higher. If you ask about nonfinancial corporates, that’s really where leverage is at levels that are high relative to history. But defaults are low, interest rates are low, you know, so it’s something— that’s something we’re watching very carefully. But, again, I don’t think we see it as—I think there are a range of views on that, but we are watching nonfinancial corporates. Households are in good shape, though, and that is—that is so important because that’s where—you know, that’s where we got into trouble before. And that’s—it’s often around property, and particularly housing, where you see real problems emerge. We don’t really see that now, so we take some solace from that. low and inflation is low. And I’m wondering if you or the Committee has thought about your move to raise interest rates as partly responding to the economy, but partly giving yourselves room to navigate in the inevitable future recession, whenever that was to come. And do you think that that has played any part in, you know, your outlook for policy or recent policy decisions? Or is it, you know, just a purely based on what the economy is doing?","Q&A","Press Conf","","262","2018-06"
"2018-06-13","You know, wages have been gradually moving up. Earlier in the recovery, they were—there are many different wage measures, of course, but—so just—but just to generalize, wages were running roughly around 2 percent and they’ve moved gradually up into between 2 to 3 percent as the labor market has become stronger and stronger. I think it’s fair to say that some of us—and I certainly would have expected wages to react more to the very significant reduction in unemployment that we’ve had, as I mentioned, from 10 percent to 3.8 percent. Part of that can be explained by low productivity, which is something we’ve talked about at the Committee and elsewhere. But, nonetheless, I think we had anticipated, and many people have anticipated, that wages—that in a world where we’re hearing lots and lots about labor shortages—everywhere we go now, we hear about labor shortages—but where is the wage reaction? So it’s a bit of a puzzle. I wouldn’t say it’s a mystery, but it’s a bit of a puzzle. And, frankly, I do think there’s a lot to like about low unemployment. And one of the things is—you will see—pretty much people who want to get jobs—not everybody—but people who want to get jobs, many of them will be able to get jobs. You will see wages go up. You’ll see people at the, sort of, the margins of the labor force having an opportunity to get back in work. They benefit from that. Society benefits from that. So there are a lot of things to really like, including higher wages, as you asked. Our role, though, is also to, you know, to make sure that—that maximum employment happens in a context of price stability and financial stability, which is why we’re gradually raising rates.","Q&A","Press Conf","","296","2018-06"
"2018-06-13","You mentioned that unemployment moved down and inflation moved up by truly small amounts. If you look at the Summary of Economic Projections, things are moving by just a tick or even a semitick between now and March.

We’re not going to—we didn’t overreact, I think, to inflation being under 2 percent. We won’t overreact to it being over 2 percent. And I think we’ll always be using our tools to move inflation in the direction of the target, if it—if it leaves—if it moves away from the target persistently, as I mentioned.

And we know that probably that rate has declined as the","Q&A","Press Conf","","176","2018-06"
"2018-06-13","Thanks. So I would say that—remember the important thing is that we want the federal funds rate to trade in the target range. That’s the whole, the whole idea. IOER is the principal tool by which we assure that that will happen. And we’ve said in our, you know, basic documents that we will adjust the use of our tools, as appropriate. We don’t expect to have to do this often or again, but we’re not sure about that. If we have to do it again, we’ll do it again. Again, don’t expect it to happen. You asked why. And yes, you know, we—of course, we’re looking carefully at that and, you know, the truth is we don’t—we don’t know with any precision. Really, no one does. It’s—you can’t run experiments, you know, with one effect and not the other. You know, I think there’s a lot of probability on the idea of just high bill supply leads to higher repo costs, higher money market rates generally, and the arbitrage pulls up today. What we really need is to have the federal funds rate trade in the range, and that’s what this minor technical adjustment accomplishes.","Q&A","Press Conf","","196","2018-06"
"2018-06-13","Your question—your first question, really, is, do we think the natural rate of unemployment is lower? So I think we do believe it has moved down significantly over a long period of time. We don’t think that the natural rate of unemployment— you know, it’s not one of those variables that moves around a lot. It tends to be driven by slow- moving variables, like the education level, the population, like the functioning of the labor market, and things like that. So, you know, it may—it may have moved down too, on a cyclical basis, lower. As the economy gets hotter and hotter, there’s some possibility of that. But, you know, the thing is, if you look back, there have been a lot of studies done and, you know, real- time estimates of the natural rate of unemployment have uncertainty bands, which are—which are quite wide, so we have to remember that and very much be guided by the—by the incoming data. You asked about inflation. You know, inflation we look about—we look at the 2 percent inflation objective as something that central banks, the Fed, really control. And we have to be strongly committed to achieving that using our tools to do that. I think in—in recent years the dominant force has been, you know, disinflationary—have been pushing down on inflation. And important that inflation not fall below 2 percent, that inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2 percent—very important—because the implications of inflation below 2 percent are that you’re closer to the zero lower bound, meaning the Fed has less room to cut, meaning that we’ll spend more time there and we won’t be able to do the job that we’re assigned to do for our citizens.","Q&A","Press Conf","","289","2018-06"
"2018-06-13","Yeah, it may be. It may be. We may find that out. You know, the best estimate that we have, over the longer run, is that. Although, you know, there’s a range of views, you know. Some people are in the low 4s, and, again, I said the uncertainty bands are, you know, not quite a full percentage point on either side, but ¾ of a percent, that kind of thing, so it’s very possible. We have to be, you know—we can’t do—we can’t be too attached to these unobservable variables. You know, we—I think we have to be practical about the way we think about these things and we do that by being grounded in the data and what we see happening in the real economy.","Q&A","Press Conf","","127","2018-06"
"2018-06-13","I would just—would—I would just emphasize, emphasize that—a couple things. First, we’re learning about the real location of the natural rate of unemployment as we go. So it’s moved down by more than a full percentage point since 2012. So it’s not so simple as thinking, oh boy, we’ve just got to go ahead and get that rate up. If you—if you look at the forecast, two years from now, end of 2020, you’re still seeing inflation very close to target. So there’s no sense that inflation will—no sense in our models, or in our projections, or forecasts—that inflation will take off or move unexpectedly quickly from these levels, even if unemployment does remain low. So that’s—that’s what—so it’s important to know that the—the unemployment rate forecasts go with the inflation forecasts and go with the rate forecasts.

"2018-08-24","In keeping with the spirit of this year's symposium topic--the changing structures of the economy--I would also note briefly that the U.S. economy faces a number of longer-term structural challenges that are mostly beyond the reach of monetary policy.","General","Speech","N/A","39","2018-08"

"2018-08-24","The topic of managing uncertainty in policymaking remains particularly salient.","General","Speech","N/A","10","2018-08"
"2018-08-24","I will focus today on one of the many facets of uncertainty discussed at the 2003 symposium--uncertainty around the location of important macroeconomic variables such as the natural rate of unemployment.","General","Speech","N/A","31","2018-08"
"2018-08-24","A good place to start is with two opposing questions that regularly arise in discussions of monetary policy both inside and outside the Fed:","General","Speech","N/A","24","2018-08"
"2018-08-24","With the unemployment rate well below estimates of its longer-term normal level, why isn't the FOMC tightening monetary policy more sharply to head off overheating and inflation?","General","Speech","N/A","27","2018-08"
"2018-08-24","With no clear sign of an inflation problem, why is the FOMC tightening policy at all, at the risk of choking off job growth and continued expansion?","General","Speech","N/A","27","2018-08"
"2018-08-24","These questions strike me as representing the two errors that the Committee is always seeking to avoid as expansions continue--moving too fast and needlessly shortening the expansion, versus moving too slowly and risking a destabilizing overheating.","General","Speech","N/A","36","2018-08"
"2018-08-24","As always, there are risk factors abroad and at home that, in time, could demand a different policy response, but today I will step back from these.","General","Speech","N/A","27","2018-08"
"2018-08-24","Further, over this period, GDP growth was slower than one might have expected based on the rapid decline in unemployment and the well-known relationship between output and unemployment known as Okun's law.","General","Speech","N/A","32","2018-08"
"2018-08-24","I will then use that framework to explain the role that structural change plays in our current policy deliberations, focusing on how that role has been shaped by two historical episodes.","General","Speech","N/A","31","2018-08"
"2018-08-24","These assessments of the values of the stars are imprecise and subject to further revision.","General","Speech","N/A","15","2018-08"
"2018-08-24","With hindsight, we recognize today that higher potential growth could accommodate the very strong growth that actually materialized, let alone the moderate growth policymakers were forecasting.12","General","Speech","N/A","26","2018-08"
"2018-08-24","The FOMC thus avoided the Great-Inflation-era mistake of overemphasizing imprecise estimates of the stars.","General","Speech","N/A","14","2018-08"
"2018-08-24","Under Chairman Greenspan's leadership, the Committee converged on a risk-management strategy that can be distilled into a simple request: Let's wait one more meeting; if there are clearer signs of inflation, we will commence tightening.13Meeting after meeting, the Committee held off on rate increases while believing that signs of rising inflation would soon appear.","General","Speech","N/A","54","2018-08"
"2018-08-24","And meeting after meeting, inflation gradually declined.","General","Speech","N/A","7","2018-08"
"2018-08-24","In retrospect, it may seem odd that it took great fortitude to defend ""let's wait one more meeting,"" given that inflation was low and falling.","General","Speech","N/A","25","2018-08"
"2018-08-24","Conventional wisdom at the time, however, still urged policymakers to respond preemptively to inflation risk--even when that risk was gleaned mainly from hazy, real-time assessments of the stars.","General","Speech","N/A","28","2018-08"
"2018-08-24","With the experience in the new-economy period, policymakers were beginning to appreciate that, with inflation expectations much better anchored than before, there was a smaller risk that an inflation uptick under Greenspan's ""wait and see"" approach would become a significant problem.","General","Speech","N/A","41","2018-08"
"2018-08-24","Risk Management in the Face of Shifting StarsGiven what the economy has shown us over the past 15 years, the need for the sort of risk‑management approach that originated in the new-economy era is clearer than ever before.","General","Speech","N/A","38","2018-08"
"2018-08-24","That approach continues to evolve based on experience and the growing literature on monetary policy and structural uncertainty.","General","Speech","N/A","18","2018-08"
"2018-08-24","Experience has revealed two realities about the relation between inflation and unemployment, and these bear directly on the two questions I started with.","General","Speech","N/A","23","2018-08"
"2018-08-24","First, the stars are sometimes far from where we perceive them to be.","General","Speech","N/A","13","2018-08"
"2018-08-24","In particular, we now know that the level of the unemployment rate relative to our real-time estimate of u* will sometimes be a misleading indicator of the state of the economy or of future inflation.","General","Speech","N/A","35","2018-08"
"2018-08-24","Second, the reverse also seems to be true: Inflation may no longer be the first or best indicator of a tight labor market and rising pressures on resource utilization.","General","Speech","N/A","29","2018-08"
"2018-08-24","Part of the reason inflation sends a weaker signal is undoubtedly the achievement of anchored inflation expectations and the related flattening of the Phillips curve.14Whatever the cause, in the run-up to the past two recessions, destabilizing excesses appeared mainly in financial markets rather than in inflation.","General","Speech","N/A","46","2018-08"
"2018-08-24","Thus, risk management suggests looking beyond inflation for signs of excesses.","General","Speech","N/A","11","2018-08"
"2018-08-24","These two realities present challenges.","General","Speech","N/A","5","2018-08"
"2018-08-24","The literature on uncertainty reviewed at the 2003 symposium--and much refined since then--provides important advice for how policy should respond, although not yet, in my view, an explicit recipe or rule that a prudent central bank should follow.15The literature on robust rules, such as so-called difference rules, for example, supports the idea of putting less emphasis on the level of unemployment relative to u*.16The FOMC's practice of looking at a broad range of indicators when assessing the state of the labor market has explicitly been part of the FOMC's Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy since its inception in 2012.17We have greatly expanded the scope of our surveillance for signs of labor market tightness and of destabilizing excesses more generally.","General","Speech","N/A","122","2018-08"
"2018-08-24","The risks from misperceiving the stars also now play a prominent role in the FOMC's deliberations.","General","Speech","N/A","16","2018-08"
"2018-08-24","A paper by Federal Reserve Board staff is a recent example of a range of research that helps FOMC participants visualize and manage these risks.18The research reports simulations of the economic outcomes that might result under various policy rules and policymaker misperceptions about the economy.","General","Speech","N/A","45","2018-08"
"2018-08-24","One general finding is that no single, simple approach to monetary policy is likely to be appropriate across a broad range of plausible scenarios.19More concretely, simulations like these inform our risk management by assessing the likelihood that misperception would lead to adverse outcomes, such as inflation falling below zero or rising above 5 percent.","General","Speech","N/A","54","2018-08"
"2018-08-24","Finally, the literature on structural uncertainty suggests some broader insights.","General","Speech","N/A","10","2018-08"
"2018-08-24","This literature started with the work of William Brainard and the well-known Brainard principle, which recommends that when you are uncertain about the effects of your actions, you should move conservatively.20In other words, when unsure of the potency of a medicine, start with a somewhat smaller dose.","General","Speech","N/A","47","2018-08"
"2018-08-24","As Brainard made clear, this is not a universal truth, and recent research highlights two particularly important cases in which doing too little comes with higher costs than doing too much.","General","Speech","N/A","31","2018-08"
"2018-08-24","The first case is when attempting to avoid severely adverse events such as a financial crisis or an extended period with interest rates at the effective lower bound.21In such situations, the famous words ""We will do whatever it takes"" will likely be more effective than ""We will take cautious steps toward doing whatever it takes.""","General","Speech","N/A","55","2018-08"
"2018-08-24","Put another way, labor productivity growth consistently disappointed, which raised the question of whether that shortfall was temporary‑‑perhaps due to headwinds from the crisis--or was part of a new normal.","General","Speech","N/A","30","2018-08"
"2018-08-24","Greenspan was also right that the potential growth rate had shifted up.","General","Speech","N/A","12","2018-08"
"2018-08-24","The labor market looked to be tight and getting tighter in real time, but in retrospect, we estimate that there was slack in the labor market in 1996 and early 1997, and the labor market only tightened appreciably through 1998 (figure 4).","General","Speech","N/A","42","2018-08"
"2018-08-24","If expectations were to begin to drift, the reality or expectation of a weak initial response could exacerbate the problem.22I am confident that the FOMC would resolutely ""do whatever it takes"" should inflation expectations drift materially up or down or should crisis again threaten.","General","Speech","N/A","44","2018-08"
"2018-08-24","Whereas during the Great Inflation period the real-time natural rate of unemployment had been well below our current-day assessment, in the new-economy period, this relation was reversed (figure 3).","General","Speech","N/A","29","2018-08"
"2018-08-24","Our approach to this challenge has been shaped by two much discussed historical episodes--the Great Inflation of the 1960s and 1970s and the ""new economy"" period of the late 1990s.","General","Speech","N/A","30","2018-08"
"2018-08-24","Shifting Stars and the Great InflationWhile the crisis and its aftermath have been extraordinary in many ways, the shifting of the stars is not one of them.Figure 2illustrates the Congressional Budget Office's (CBO) current estimate of movements in the natural rate of unemployment and potential GDP growth from 1960 to 2000.5Viewed against the ups and downs observed over these four decades, the recent shifts in longer-run values are not all that dramatic.","General","Speech","N/A","72","2018-08"

"2018-08-24","Multiple factors, including monetary policy errors, contributed to the Great Inflation.","General","Speech","N/A","11","2018-08"
"2018-08-24","Many researchers have concluded that a key mistake was that monetary policymakers placed too much emphasis on imprecise--and, as it turns out, overly optimistic--real-time estimates of the natural rate of unemployment.6","General","Speech","N/A","31","2018-08"
"2018-08-24","Figure 3compares the CBO's current view of the natural rate of unemployment in that era with an estimate by Athanasios Orphanides and John Williams of the rate as policymakers perceived it in real time.","General","Speech","N/A","34","2018-08"
"2018-08-24","From 1965 to the early 1980s, this real-time estimate of u* was well below where hindsight now places it.","General","Speech","N/A","19","2018-08"
"2018-08-24","The unemployment rate over this period was generally well above the real-time natural rate, and contemporary documents reveal that policymakers were wary of pushing the unemployment rate even further above u* (figure 4, top panel).7With the benefit of hindsight, we now think that, except for a few years in the mid-1970s, the labor market was tight and contributing to inflation's rise (figure 4, lower panel).","General","Speech","N/A","65","2018-08"
"2018-08-24","It is now clear that the FOMC had placed too much emphasis on its imprecise estimates of u* and too little emphasis on evidence of rising inflation expectations.","General","Speech","N/A","28","2018-08"
"2018-08-24","The Great Inflation did, however, prompt an ""expectations revolution"" in macroeconomic thinking, with one overwhelmingly important lesson for monetary policymakers: Anchoring longer-term inflation expectations is a vital precondition for reaching all other monetary policy goals.8","General","Speech","N/A","35","2018-08"
"2018-08-24","To return to the nautical metaphor, the FOMC has been navigating between the shoals of overheating and premature tightening with only a hazy view of what seem to be shifting navigational guides.","General","Speech","N/A","32","2018-08"
"2018-08-24","This is the key insight at the heart of the widespread adoption of inflation targeting by central banks in the wake of the Great Inflation.","General","Speech","N/A","25","2018-08"
"2018-08-24","Anchored expectations give a central bank greater flexibility to stabilize both unemployment and inflation.","General","Speech","N/A","14","2018-08"
"2018-08-24","When a central bank acts to stimulate the economy to bring down unemployment, inflation might push above the bank's inflation target.","General","Speech","N/A","21","2018-08"
"2018-08-24","With expectations anchored, people expect the central bank to pursue policies that bring inflation back down, and longer-term inflation expectations do not rise.","General","Speech","N/A","23","2018-08"

"2018-08-24","Shifting Stars and the ""New Economy"" of the Late 1990sThe second half of the 1990s confronted policymakers with a situation that was in some ways the flipside of that in the Great Inflation.","General","Speech","N/A","33","2018-08"
"2018-08-24","In mid-1996, the unemployment rate was below the natural rate as perceived in real time, and many FOMC participants and others were forecasting growth above the economy's potential.","General","Speech","N/A","28","2018-08"
"2018-08-24","Sentiment was building on the FOMC to raise the federal funds rate to head off the risk of rising inflation.9But Chairman Greenspan had a hunch that the United States was experiencing the wonders of a ""new economy"" in which improved productivity growth would allow faster output growth and lower unemployment, without serious inflation risks.","General","Speech","N/A","54","2018-08"

"2018-09-26","Okay, so are we accommodative now? So I think if you look at the—look at the dot plot in the SEP, you’ll see that the federal funds rate, even after today’s move, is below the longer-run neutral estimate of every single participant that—who submits a— an estimate of that. So that’s why this is the perfect time to take the language out, because, you know, it’s perfectly clear that there can’t be a signal because, you know, by definition, that means an accommodative policy. So it wasn’t because policy is not accommodative. It is still accommodative. The thinking was more, as I mentioned, it’s more that the language has run its useful life. There’s another point, though, too, which is, you know, we don’t want to suggest either that we have this precise understanding of where “accommodative” stops or suggest that that’s a really important point in our thinking. You know, what we’re going to be doing, assuming we we want to achieve—you know, sustain the economy, maximum employment, stable prices. That’s the way we’re thinking about it, and that does kind of amount to thinking less about one’s precise point estimate of the neutral rate.

"2018-09-26","Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for being here. I am going to start with an overview of how my colleagues and I see the economy, what we decided today, and then a bit about our expectations for the months ahead. Our economy is strong. Growth is running at a healthy clip. Unemployment is low, the number of people working is rising steadily, and wages are up. Inflation is low and stable. All of these are very good signs. Of course, that’s not to say that everything is perfect. The benefits of this strong economy have not reached all Americans. Many of our country’s economic challenges are beyond the scope of the Fed, but my colleagues and I are doing all we can to keep the economy strong, healthy, and moving forward. That is the best way we can promote an environment in which every American has the opportunity to succeed. Each time my colleagues and I meet, we face the same question: How can we set policy to best support job growth and low, steady inflation? For many years, this question called for very low interest rates to help an economy that had been damaged by the deep financial crisis that gripped the world 10 years ago. As the economy has steadily gained strength, the Fed has been gradually returning interest rates closer to levels that are normal in a healthy economy. We took another step on that path today with a quarter-point increase in short-term interest rates. These rates remain low, and my colleagues and I believe that this gradual return to normal is helping to sustain this strong economy for the longer-run benefit of all Americans. As I mentioned, 10 years have now passed since the depths of the financial crisis—a painful part of our history that cost many Americans their jobs, their homes, and, for some, their hopes and dreams. In addition to holding interest rates low to support the recovery, we have also taken many steps to make the financial system safer. In particular, we’re holding the largest in a far better position to support the financial needs of households and businesses through good times and bad. We continue to work to sustain these fundamental improvements while also ensuring that regulation is both effective and efficient. Now, let me go into more detail about the developments that motivated today’s policy decision. Both household spending and business investment are expanding briskly, and the overall growth outlook remains favorable. And several factors support this assessment: Fiscal policy is boosting the economy, ongoing job gains are raising incomes and confidence, and overall financial conditions remain accommodative. These conditions are consistent with our Summary of Economic Projections for this meeting. The median of Committee participants’ projections for the growth of real GDP is 3.1 percent this year and 2.5 percent next year. Job gains averaged 185,000 per month over the last three months, well above the pace needed in the longer run to provide jobs for new entrants to the labor force. The unemployment rate stood at 3.9 percent in August and has been near that level since April. Smoothing through month-to-month variations, the labor force participation rate remains about where it was in late 2013—a positive sign, given that the aging of our population is putting downward pressure on participation. We expect the job market to remain strong. And the median of Committee participants’ projections for the unemployment rate later this year is 3.7 percent and a bit lower than that in 2019. Overall consumer prices, as measured by the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE inflation), increased 2.3 percent over the 12 months ending in July. The core price index, which excludes the prices of energy and food and tends to be a better indicator of time, inflation may be somewhat above or below 2 percent. For example, the recent rise in oil prices has pushed inflation a little above 2 percent, but we expect this to be transitory, as is reflected in our projections. The median projections for both the overall and core inflation measures remain very close to 2 percent across the whole projection horizon. Today the Committee raised the target range for the federal funds rate by ¼ percentage point, bringing it to 2 to 2¼ percent. This action reflects the strength we see in the economy and is one more step in the process that we began almost three years ago of gradually returning interest rates to more normal levels. Looking ahead, today’s projections show gradual interest rate increases continuing roughly as foreseen in June. The median of participants’ views on appropriate policy through 2020 are unchanged since the June meeting. These projections play an important role in our work. My colleagues and I believe that it’s useful to communicate our views on likely prospects for the economy and for policy. We are well aware, however, that the economy regularly surprises, and that even the most carefully constructed projections are highly uncertain. The projections about the appropriate path of policy assume that the economy evolves broadly in line with the projections for growth, employment, unemployment, and inflation. If the economy were instead to falter, lower interest rates would be appropriate. Conversely, if inflationary pressures were to rise more than expected, higher interest rates would be appropriate. Right now, as our statement indicates, risks to the economic outlook appear roughly balanced. Readers of the FOMC statement likely noted that the Committee dropped a sentence that indicated that “the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative.” This change does not target range for the federal funds rate,” and this expectation is reflected in the projections that I just discussed. Thanks very much. I’m","Opening Statement","Press Conf","","946","2018-09"
"2018-09-26","So we’ve been given a really important job to do on behalf of the American people by Congress, and we’ve been given the tools to do it, and my colleagues extensively and come to a perspective and try to set monetary policy to achieve maximum employment in a context of price stability. That’s what we do. We don’t consider political factors or things like that. And so that’s who we are, that’s what we do, and that’s just the way it’s always going to be for us.","Q&A","Press Conf","","87","2018-09"
"2018-09-26","Sure. So in terms of financial markets and monetary policy, we—as we say in our statement every cycle, we do take financial conditions into consideration because financial—broader financial conditions do affect the broader economy, and they’re one of the many things that we take into account. The part of it that we control, though, is what we do with the federal funds rate and that has—that has effects out through, you know, out through the full interest rate curve and into financial asset prices generally. So the answer is, we take everything into account, but, you know, broader financial conditions are just one of the things that we take into account. In terms of ’20 and ’21, why—your question was why the funds rate needs to be above neutral? So you’re right. Some of—some of the participants have mostly very modest going to be. What we’re going to be doing as we—as we go through time is asking at every meeting whether monetary policy is set to achieve our goals. And I think that that’s an assessment of where policy will need to be some years down the road, and I’ll leave it at that.","Q&A","Press Conf","","195","2018-09"
"2018-09-26","No, you’re right. The Committee forecasts what they—what they show, in general, is an economy where unemployment remains in the high and middle 3s throughout the entire forecast period and inflation remains very close to 2 percent. That is what the forecast shows. And that is based on our understanding of the way the inflation process works now and on the fact that the inflation seems to be fairly nonreactive to changes in slack— that is to say, a flat Phillips curve. And it’s just—it’s a—it’s a world of strongly anchored inflation expectations. And that’s not just our forecast, that’s many forecasts. So that is—that is —that is the forecast. So you may ask—I mean, the sense is, what does the longer-run natural rate of unemployment mean? And so that really is a longer-run concept that we think the economy will return to over the longer run. But, obviously, that longer run, you know, isn’t— it’s not creating problems in the short run for that forecast. will remain the way it is, and, you know, we will be, of course, watching carefully. If inflation reacts more strongly or more weakly to the strong economy, then we’ll adjust policy appropriately.","Q&A","Press Conf","","199","2018-09"
"2018-09-26","Well, interest rates, of course, have effects on growth, have effects—I mean if—I guess the—your question was, what are you buying with by raising interest rates? The question is, what would the economy look like if you didn’t raise rates? It would look very different, I think, if we didn’t raise rates. We’re always trying to, you know, work our way between the—sort of the two—the two problems we face. One is that if we move too quickly, we can, you know, snuff out a recovery unnecessarily, and inflation falls short of its 2 percent target. Or if we move too slowly, we have an economy that can overheat. So we’re—that—that’s happened through history. We don’t see any signs of that now, but we’re always trying to navigate between those two shoals. And we think that gradually, you know, raising interest rates is the way that we kind of take both of those risks seriously.","Q&A","Press Conf","","155","2018-09"
"2018-09-26","As I said, I think I’m in the camp of seeing vulnerabilities as relatively moderate. I think the financial system—I think another thing that we learned in the crisis is that we need to be alert to the buildup of vulnerabilities as a long expansion continues. I don’t see that in troubling—troubling amounts at this point, but, you know, I think it’s appropriate for us to monitor that very carefully.","Q&A","Press Conf","","70","2018-09"
"2018-09-26","Sure. So I guess I need to start by saying that we’re not responsible for trade policy, and we don’t comment on particular, you know, trade actions and that sort of thing. But you will have seen that we have this very extensive network of business contacts around the country through the Reserve Banks largely, and we’ve been hearing a rising chorus of concerns from businesses all over the country about disruption of supply chains, materials costs and increases, and loss of markets, and things like that. So we’ve been hearing quite a lot of that, and we—the Reserve Bank presidents talk about it in the meeting, and it goes in the minutes. So we, you know, that’s—we’re very transparent about hearing all that. I think if you look at the aggregate perform—the performance of the","Q&A","Press Conf","","136","2018-09"
"2018-09-26","Oh, supply-side effects, yeah. So, you know, we hope they’re huge, frankly. You know, the idea is, you cut—you reduce taxation on corporations and particularly—and allow faster expensing for investment. The idea is to encourage more investment, and that is one of the things that drives productivity, which is one of the main things that drives rising incomes. So the effects are very uncertain, they’re—you know, they’re—the literature is—it’s—there’s no clear answer to exactly how these mechanisms work or how effective they are. And it would be soon to be seeing supply-side effects. The other—supply- side effects are probably both more uncertain and they’re probably slower to come in. But, you know, as I said, we—I certainly hope—I hope that we’ll be marking up our estimates of potential growth as well.","Q&A","Press Conf","","131","2018-09"
"2018-09-26","You mean—you mean, where’s the point at which inflation— unemployment is too low? Yeah. Yeah. You know, so we’ve been—I think the perform—labor fourth quarter of ’13 till now, you really have a—kind of an oscillation that basically is a sideways movement in the face of a significant downward trend, thanks to aging and other factors. That’s a gain of well more than a percentage point in participation, so that’s really— that’s really a good thing. Those are people who are remaining in contact with the labor force and looking for jobs, finding jobs. So that’s a great thing. And, by the way, it’s a signal. It’s one of the things that has allowed the unemployment rate not to fall further. And it’s a—it’s a signal, too, that there may be more there on the supply side, that there may be more labor supply than the prior trend would indicate. So it’s a very positive thing to see people staying in the labor force. And, you know, we don’t know how long it can continue. We have models, and we look at this—we look at this question all the time. And, you know, admittedly, we’ve been surprised on the positive side here, so we’re open to the idea that that may continue or not.","Q&A","Press Conf","","214","2018-09"
"2018-09-26","It’s a concern. It’s a risk. You know, so you could see prices moving up. You don’t see it yet, but we—you could see retail prices moving up. The tariffs shop on the internet. This could provide, you know, a way for—again, we don’t see it in the numbers. And, you know, until we see it in the numbers, it’s hard to say how one would react. And the other question would be, if you’re just talking about the effect on inflation is, is it just a one-time increase in the price level, or is it actually fueling higher inflation going forward? And that’s a real—that’s an important question in, in how we would think about the appropriate response.","Q&A","Press Conf","","119","2018-09"
"2018-09-26","Don’t see it yet. You know, don’t see it yet, but we—you’re hearing—I mean, broadly across the economy, it’s not just tariffs. You’re hearing—we’re hearing a lot of talk of labor shortages, of material costs in particular industries. We’re hearing a lot, you know, what amount to supply-side constraints and things like that, but we’re not seeing it. We’re seeing a sort of modest increase in wages, inflation right around 2 percent, no sense of it moving up really, so we’re not seeing it yet. And, you know, we just aren’t, and we’re watching very carefully.","Q&A","Press Conf","","96","2018-09"
"2018-09-26","A couple questions in there. So the dot plot—I mean, I—it’s not new. I don’t think it’s a new point that forecasts two and three out—two or three years out are fairly uncertain. The dot plot is individual FOMC participants who are writing down their individual views on the evolution of the economy and of appropriate monetary policy. We don’t vote on that. These are individual forecasts. I think market participants generally find that interesting information, and so it seems to me to be serving a purpose. I think the point with “accommodative” was that its useful life was over. You know, we put that in the statement in 2015, just when we lifted off, and the idea was to provide assurance that we weren’t trying to slow down the economy, but, in fact, we were still—interest rates were still going to be pushing to support economic activity. Well, that—you know, that purpose has been well served, and the language now doesn’t really say anything that’s important to the way the Committee is thinking about policy going forward. That’s why that came out. Did I get— did I get all of your ques—?","Q&A","Press Conf","","193","2018-09"
"2018-09-26","Yeah, you know, it’s—if you look at a broad financial conditions index, that’s pretty much the answer you’ll get. We don’t control that, and, as I mentioned earlier, we do take financial conditions into account in what we do. And financial conditions are affecting the broader economy, so, by definition, we’re taking them into account. But if you look at—look at interest rates, you know, interest rates—look at long-term interest rates this year and short-term interest rates this year, there’s very significant increases. And, you","Q&A","Press Conf","","85","2018-09"
"2018-09-26","Okay, so in terms of nominations to the Fed, those are entirely, completely under the control of the White House and, ultimately, the President. And traditionally, the Fed Chair has been consulted on those, and I’m happy to say that that has continued. But these are—these are really decisions for the White House, and, you know, we are—think of us as just being consulted. I will say that I’m very happy and excited about the team that we’re putting together, and I’m very much looking forward to having those offices up and down our hall filled. It’s been pretty quiet, more quieter than usual, which is saying something on the Board hall. So we’re looking forward to getting some people confirmed. In terms of corporate debt, so this is a—this is a—you know, I was an investor for a long time in areas that were very close to the leveraged lending markets. So, you know, I have had a lot of experience in that. That market has evolved really significantly since before the crisis. And, you know, the banks take much less risk than they used to. They’re—the—they’re this—that excessive risk-taking in the leveraged lending markets does have channels for affecting the real economy, if there’s overheating and that kind of thing in those markets, so we monitor that carefully. You know, the guidance is—isn’t binding, as you pointed out, that the leveraged lending isn’t binding, and that’s just—that’s just the way that the law is interpreted. So it’s something we’re monitoring, and, as I mentioned, we think overall vulnerabilities are moderate.","Q&A","Press Conf","","262","2018-09"

"2018-09-26","It’s possible. It’s very possible. It happens often. And, as I mentioned, many of the participants have written that down, and they’ve written down really modest overshoots, you know, amounting to one rate hike kind of thing, which wouldn’t have a big effect on the economy. You know, it—I would just say, you know, it really depends on what happens. It depends on if we keep going—you can think of it different ways. Maybe we’ve underestimated the neutral rate. Maybe we’ll be raising our estimate of the neutral rate and we’ll just go to that, or maybe we’ll keep our neutral rate here and then go one or two rate increases beyond it. I think it’s very possible, but I mean, ultimately, isn’t really the question we’re answering. The question we’re answering is, how do we provide the economy just the right amount of support— not too much, not too little—to sustain the recovery and achieve our statutory goals?","Q&A","Press Conf","","159","2018-09"
"2018-09-26","So, three things there. The first thing is the single biggest thing I think that we learned was the—as I mentioned, I think, earlier, the importance of maintaining the stability of the financial system. So I think if you look—if you look back at the way the models worked and the way people thought about risk in the economy, that’s what was missing, and I think it’s not missing anymore. So we—you know, we put a tremendous focus on that. We raised capital, liquidity. We have stress tests, which force banks to understand—the largest banks particularly—to understand and better manage their risk and have enough capital to survive a really substantial shock that’s at least as bad as the financial crisis. And if all that doesn’t work, we’ve got resolution plans, which we’ve, you know, through many cycles, have made really substantial progress, more than I had thought was likely. So we’ve done a lot. Nobody’s—you know, nobody is, I think, overconfident that we’ve solved every problem. And, you know, now we’re going back and kind of taking a hard look at everything and, you know, trying to make—trying to—trying to keep at it. So I think those are the really important lessons, and, you know, we—we’re determined not to, you know, not to forget them. And that’s, I think, a risk now—is to—is to forget things that we—that we learned. That’s just human nature over time. I saw the article you’re talking about; the question is, did Congress take things away, emergency powers from the Fed? So there was sort of a trade for taking away our power under authority. Was it a mistake? I don’t think there’s any sense that Congress would seriously look at changing that. I have real doubts about whether it was wise to take away our crisis-fighting tools. I think you put them away, and you hope you never need them, but—and I certainly strongly oppose efforts to take away more of our tools. You know, the third thing you mentioned is the designation power. So it’s a really important power. In my mind, it should be used—my thinking, it should be used sparingly, and that means, you know, in situations where you have—I mean, in principle, you could have another Lehman Brothers come up out of the ground that’s not a bank, and it could be very threatening—or it could be capable of creating systemic risk. And so I think it’s a critical power to have. But, again, I would use it—I would tend to use it fairly sparingly.","Q&A","Press Conf","","426","2018-09"
"2018-09-26","Yeah, we look—of course, we look at that very carefully, and interest rates are going up across a broad range of consumer borrowing, as they would when we raise short-term interest rates. They’re still quite low by historical levels. And the other thing I’ll say is, take—if you take housing, if you look at the NAR Affordability Index, housing is still more affordable now than it was before the financial crisis.

"2018-09-26","Sure. So, you know, some of the things that we’d be looking at to tell us whether we’re getting close to supply-side limits would be, first, does job growth slow down? A slowing down in job growth would be an indicator, you know. An unexpectedly sharp increase in wages or inflation could tell you that you’re reaching those points. You know, if headline growth slowed down, that’s another one. So all of those things would be worth taking into consideration. I think also, though, we’ve seen sometimes sharp tightening in financial conditions, as we saw at the beginning of 2016, can have a substantial effect pretty quickly on our economy if it’s a broad and significant tightening. So we would be looking for those kinds of things and many other things. So, in terms of divergence, yes. So the","Q&A","Press Conf","","139","2018-09"
"2018-09-26","So we’ve said that we would use our tools to assure that the federal funds rate trains—trades within the target range. And the principal tools we use have been interest on excess reserves and then, at the bottom end, a reverse repo facility. So we—in June, when we raised rates, we only raised the interest on excess reserves by 20 basis points and raised the range by 25, and that moved federal funds sort of back into the range. It worked, and it was successful. The federal funds rate traded in the low 190s, well within the range. We may—we may do that again. You know, we—again, we have our tools, and we will use them. We think it’s principally a function just of a number of things, but particularly high Treasury supply, and—which is showing up in repo rates and then showing up in fed funds as well. So we don’t see it as a—as a big problem. We see it as a problem we can address with our tools, and we’ll use them if we have to.","Q&A","Press Conf","","179","2018-09"
"2018-09-26","So it doesn’t really come up. It’s not really our job. And we do—we do monetary policy. We regulate financial institutions, financial stability, that sort of thing. We don’t have responsibility for fiscal policy. But in the longer-run, fiscal policy will have a significant effect on the economy, so for that reason, I think my predecessors have commented on fiscal policy. But they’ve commented on—at a high level rather than trying to get involved in particular, you know, particular measures. And so—and I—my plan is to kind of stick to the same approach and stay in our lane. And, you know—so I would just say, it’s—it’s no secret, it’s been true for a long time that with our uniquely expensive health-care delivery system and the aging of our population, we’ve been on an unsustainable fiscal path for a long time, and there’s no hiding from it. In the end, we will have to face that, and I think, you know, the sooner, the better. And also, these are good times. These are, you know, this is—this is the economy at nearly full employment or in the range—in the neighborhood of full employment. Interest rates are low.

You know, we would—we would look very carefully at the nature of it, and I mean, it—really—really what hurts is if consumers are borrowing heavily and doing so against, for example, an asset that can fall in value. So that’s a really serious matter when you have a housing bubble and highly levered consumers and housing values fall. And we know that that’s a really bad situation.

"2018-10-02","As I discussed in a recent speech, many analysts have accounted for the lack of rising inflation pressure by lowering their estimate of the natural rate.19For example, since the start of 2016, the unemployment rate has fallen about 1 percentage point, and estimates of the natural rate from four well-known sources have fallen over that period between 0.3 percent and 0.7 percent (figure 9).","General","Speech","N/A","64","2018-10"

"2018-10-02","Our best estimates, however, suggest that so long as inflation expectations remain anchored, a modest steepening of the Phillips curve would be unlikely to cause a significant rise in inflation or demand a disruptive policy tightening.18Once again, the key is the anchored expectations.","General","Speech","N/A","43","2018-10"

"2018-11-28","Compared with other economies, lending and borrowing in the United States depend less on bank loans and more on funds flowing through a wide array of capital market channels.","General","Speech","N/A","29","2018-11"
"2018-11-28","The share of these assets is about four times its pre-crisis level.","General","Speech","N/A","12","2018-11"
"2018-11-28","The most recent stress tests indicate that, even after a severe global recession, capital levels at the largest banks would remain above regulatory minimums, and above the levels those banks held in good times before the crisis.4The most systemically important financial institutions also now hold roughly 20 percent of their assets in the form of high quality liquid assets--that is, safe assets that could be readily sold at short notice (figure 2).","General","Speech","N/A","72","2018-11"
"2018-11-28","As a result, banks now have much more high quality capital than before (figure 1).","General","Speech","N/A","15","2018-11"

"2018-11-28","Banks hold low levels of liabilities that are able and likely to run, and they hold high levels of liquid assets to fund any outflows that do occur.","General","Speech","N/A","28","2018-11"
"2018-11-28","My own assessment is that, while risks are above normal in some areas and below normal in others, overall financial stability vulnerabilities are at a moderate level.13","General","Speech","N/A","27","2018-11"

"2018-11-28","In addition to monitoring vulnerabilities under our four-part framework, we also consult a broad range of contacts regarding sources of risk that might trigger distress at any given time.","General","Speech","N/A","29","2018-11"
"2018-11-28","For example, discussions with contacts currently point to risks emanating from the normalization of monetary policy in the United States and elsewhere, the unsettled state of trade negotiations, Brexit negotiations, budget discussions between Italy and the European Union, and cyber-related disruptions.12","General","Speech","N/A","41","2018-11"
"2018-11-28","Having identified possible triggers, we can assess how a particular trigger is likely to interact with known vulnerabilities.","General","Speech","N/A","18","2018-11"

"2018-11-28","Bottom Line: Financial Stability Risks Are ModerateI have reviewed a few of the key facts that inform our thinking about financial stability, and you will find a great deal more detail in our new report.","General","Speech","N/A","35","2018-11"

"2018-11-28","In my view, the most important feature of the stability landscape is the strength of the financial system.","General","Speech","N/A","18","2018-11"
"2018-11-28","The risks of destabilizing runs are far lower than in the past.","General","Speech","N/A","12","2018-11"
"2018-11-28","The institutions at the heart of the financial system are more resilient.","General","Speech","N/A","12","2018-11"
"2018-11-28","The stress tests routinely feature extremely severe downturns in business credit, and the largest banks have the capital and liquidity to continue to function under such circumstances.","General","Speech","N/A","27","2018-11"
"2018-11-28","Because this core resilience is so important, we are committed to preserving and strengthening the key improvements since the crisis, particularly those in capital, liquidity, stress testing, and resolution.","General","Speech","N/A","29","2018-11"
"2018-11-28","ConclusionI'd like to conclude by putting financial stability and our two new reports in a longer-term context.","General","Speech","N/A","17","2018-11"
"2018-11-28","To paraphrase a famous line, ""eternal vigilance is the price of financial stability.""","General","Speech","N/A","13","2018-11"
"2018-11-28","We will publish these reports regularly as part of our vigilance.","General","Speech","N/A","11","2018-11"
"2018-11-28","Over time, some may be tempted to dismiss the reports entirely or to overdramatize any concerns they raise.","General","Speech","N/A","18","2018-11"
"2018-11-28","Instead, these reports should be viewed as you might view the results of a regular health checkup.","General","Speech","N/A","17","2018-11"
"2018-11-28","We all hope for a report that is not very exciting.","General","Speech","N/A","11","2018-11"
"2018-11-28","Many baby boomers like me are, however, reaching an age where a good report is, ""Well, there are a number of things we should keep an eye on, but all things considered you are in good health.""","General","Speech","N/A","37","2018-11"
"2018-11-28","Thus, the purpose of the report is to provide a common platform and set of readings from which policymakers and other interested parties can form their own views.","General","Speech","N/A","28","2018-11"
"2018-11-28","Money market mutual fund reforms have greatly reduced the run risk in that sector.","General","Speech","N/A","14","2018-11"
"2018-11-28","The asset class that gets the most attention day-to-day is, of course, the stock market.","General","Speech","N/A","15","2018-11"
"2018-11-28","For example, even after standard adjustments for economic conditions, valuations on riskier forms of corporate debt and commercial properties are in the upper ends of their post-crisis distributions, although they are short of the levels they hit in the pre-crisis credit boom.","General","Speech","N/A","42","2018-11"
"2018-11-28","Taken together, the evidence on these first two vulnerabilities strongly supports the view that financial institutions and markets are substantially more resilient than they were before the crisis.","General","Speech","N/A","28","2018-11"
"2018-11-28","In the rest of my comments, I will focus on financial stability--a topic that has always been on the menu, but that, since the crisis, has become a more integral part of the meal.","General","Speech","N/A","34","2018-11"
"2018-11-28","Indeed, the American financial system has successfully weathered some periods of significant stress over the past several years.9","General","Speech","N/A","18","2018-11"
"2018-11-28","The third vulnerability is excessive debt loads at households and businesses.","General","Speech","N/A","11","2018-11"
"2018-11-28","Credit booms have often led to credit busts and sometimes to painful economic downturns.","General","Speech","N/A","14","2018-11"
"2018-11-28","When the bust comes, those who have overborrowed tend to sharply reduce their spending.","General","Speech","N/A","14","2018-11"
"2018-11-28","Defaults typically rise faster than had been expected, which may put financial institutions into distress.","General","Speech","N/A","15","2018-11"
"2018-11-28","These effects may combine to bring a serious economic downturn.","General","Speech","N/A","10","2018-11"
"2018-11-28","This boom-bust pattern was clear in measures of household debt around the crisis period, with mortgage debt rising far above its historical trend and then contracting sharply (seefigure 5).","General","Speech","N/A","29","2018-11"
"2018-11-28","After the contraction, household debt has grown only moderately.","General","Speech","N/A","9","2018-11"
"2018-11-28","The net increase in mortgage debt has been among borrowers with higher credit scores.","General","Speech","N/A","14","2018-11"
"2018-11-28","While heavily indebted households always suffer in a downturn, all of this suggests that household debt would not present a systemic stability threat if the economy sours.","General","Speech","N/A","27","2018-11"
"2018-11-28","Nonfinancial business borrowing presents a subtler story.","General","Speech","N/A","7","2018-11"
"2018-11-28","We see no major asset class, however, where valuations appear far in excess of standard benchmarks as some did, for example, in the late 1990s dot-com boom or the pre-crisis credit boom.","General","Speech","N/A","32","2018-11"
"2018-11-28","With corporate debt, the United States has not faced a massive credit boom like that experienced with residential mortgages before the recent crisis.","General","Speech","N/A","23","2018-11"
"2018-11-28","By this measure, the ratio of corporate debt to GDP is about where one might expect after nearly a decade of economic expansion: it is well above its trend, but not yet at the peaks hit in the late 1980s or late 1990s.","General","Speech","N/A","43","2018-11"
"2018-11-28","Further, the upward trend in recent years appears broadly consistent with the growth in business assets relative to GDP.","General","Speech","N/A","19","2018-11"
"2018-11-28","There are reasons for concern, however.","General","Speech","N/A","6","2018-11"
"2018-11-28","Information on individual firms reveals that, over the past year, firms with high leverage and interest burdens have been increasing their debt loads the most (seefigure 7).","General","Speech","N/A","27","2018-11"
"2018-11-28","In addition, other measures of underwriting quality have deteriorated, and leverage multiples have moved up.","General","Speech","N/A","15","2018-11"
"2018-11-28","Some of these highly leveraged borrowers would surely face distress if the economy turned down, leading investors to take higher-than-expected losses--developments that could exacerbate the downturn.","General","Speech","N/A","26","2018-11"
"2018-11-28","The question for financial stability is whether elevated business bankruptcies and outsized losses would risk undermining the ability of the financial system to perform its critical functions on behalf of households and businesses.","General","Speech","N/A","33","2018-11"
"2018-11-28","For now, my view is that such losses are unlikely to pose a threat to the safety and soundness of the institutions at the core of the system and, instead, are likely to fall on investors in vehicles like collateralized loan obligations with stable funding that present little threat of damaging fire sales.10Of course, we will continue to monitor developments in this sector carefully.","General","Speech","N/A","64","2018-11"
"2018-11-28","The fourth and final vulnerability arises when asset values rise far above conventional, historically observed valuation benchmarks--a phenomenon popularly referred to as a ""bubble.""","General","Speech","N/A","24","2018-11"
"2018-11-28","The contentious term ""bubble"" does not appear in our work, however.11Instead, we focus is on the extent to which an asset's price is high or low relative to conventional benchmarks based on expected payoffs and current economic conditions.","General","Speech","N/A","38","2018-11"
"2018-11-28","Historically, when asset prices soar far above standard benchmarks, sharp declines follow with some regularity, and those declines may bring economic misery reaching far beyond investors directly involved in the speculative boom.","General","Speech","N/A","32","2018-11"
"2018-11-28","We therefore pay close attention when valuations get to the extreme ends of what we have seen in history.","General","Speech","N/A","19","2018-11"
"2018-11-28","Looking across the landscape of major asset classes, we see some classes for which valuations seem high relative to history.","General","Speech","N/A","20","2018-11"
"2018-11-28","Instead, after controlling for its trend, business borrowing relative GDP has risen during expansions, no doubt reflecting business optimism, and then fallen when the cycle turned, as some of that optimism proved unfounded (seefigure 6).","General","Speech","N/A","35","2018-11"
"2018-11-28","Under the dual mandate, jobs and inflation are the Fed's meat and potatoes.","General","Speech","N/A","13","2018-11"
"2018-11-28","Interest rates are still low by historical standards, and they remain just below the broad range of estimates of the level that would be neutral for the economy‑‑that is, neither speeding up nor slowing down growth.","General","Speech","N/A","36","2018-11"

"2018-11-28","The health of the economy gradually but steadily improved, and about three years ago the FOMC judged that the interests of households and businesses, of savers and borrowers, were no longer best served by such extraordinarily low rates.","General","Speech","N/A","38","2018-11"
"2018-11-28","While FOMC participants' projections are based on our best assessments of the outlook, there is no preset policy path.","General","Speech","N/A","19","2018-11"
"2018-11-28","For seven years during the crisis and its painful aftermath, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) kept our policy interest rate unprecedentedly low--in fact, near zero--to support the economy as it struggled to recover.","General","Speech","N/A","34","2018-11"
"2018-11-28","We also know that the economic effects of our gradual rate increases are uncertain, and may take a year or more to be fully realized.","General","Speech","N/A","25","2018-11"

"2018-12-19","Sure. If you go back some years, I think we—people who were working at the Fed in 2013 and ’14 took away the lesson that the markets could be very sensitive to news about the size of the balance sheet, the pace of asset purchases, the pace of runoff, and things like that. So we thought carefully about this, on how to normalize policy, and came to the view that we would effectively have the balance sheet runoff on automatic pilot and use monetary policy, rate policy, to adjust to incoming data. And I think that has been a good decision. I think that the runoff of the balance sheet has been smooth and has served its purpose. And I don’t see us changing that. And I do think that we will continue to use monetary policy, which is to say rate policy, as the active tool of monetary policy.","Q&A","Press Conf","","150","2018-12"
"2018-12-19","Yeah, I—I’ve discussed this a couple of times. It’s a very good question. And I guess I would just go back to this: The individual forecasts are not something that the Committee votes on. They’re out in the future. We vote on the rate increase, and we write down our—you know, our own personal paths. So people have disparate views on what the endpoint could be. Ultimately, it’s going to depend on what the circumstances are. There would be circumstances in which it would be appropriate to go past neutral, and there would be circumstances in which it would be wholly inappropriate to do so. So I don’t—I wouldn’t put too much on—it does inform you, the way people are thinking about things. But don’t—I wouldn’t take it as a signal about current policy or about near-term policy.","Q&A","Press Conf","","138","2018-12"
"2018-12-19","So, as I mentioned, we monitor a broad range of economic conditions, including financial conditions—a broad range of financial conditions. And we took on board the tightening in financial conditions, which—not any one condition, but, broadly speaking, financial conditions have tightened since the September meeting, really. So we took that on board in our forecast. That’s why the forecast for growth and inflation went down a little statement language, we acknowledged those risks in the clause about monitoring developments. And we’re going to be watching carefully to see as those things develop. I think, more broadly, there’s been a sense of concern among business people and market people about global growth, and, you know, that may be partly about trade tensions, it may be partly about a variety of things. If you just mechanically drop into a model of the","Q&A","Press Conf","","140","2018-12"
"2018-12-19","So, again, I go back to the health of the economy. If you look at 2018, as I mentioned, this the best year since the financial crisis. You’ve had growth well above trend. You’ve got unemployment dropping. You’ve got inflation moving up to 2 percent. And we also have a positive forecast, as I mentioned, and, in that context, we think this move was appropriate for what is a very healthy economy. Policy at this point does not need to be accommodative. It can move to neutral. It seems appropriate that it be neutral. We’re now at the bottom end of the range of estimates of neutral. So that’s the basis upon which we made the decision. I also think we took on board, you know, the risks to that, and, you know, we’re certainly cognizant of them. Could you talk a little bit about what you expect to get from that panel, and will the dot plot be involved in that at all? How do you think the dot plot is working? Are we dealing with it the way that you want us to be handling the dot plot, or is it something that you might tweak a bit?","Q&A","Press Conf","","200","2018-12"
"2018-12-19","So this review, what it really is—it’s coming at a time when the economy is strong, and it’s a good time to take a step back, we think, and ask whether our strategy and our tools and our communications around monetary policy are doing the job that Congress has assigned us to do on behalf of the American people. And what we’re going to do is, we’re going to open ourselves up and have a discussion with many outside groups of all different parts of the economy, including, you know, an academic conference in June in Chicago. And, again, the idea is to, you know, listen to new ideas, better ideas, old ideas—many of them have been around—and try to assess whether there are better ways we can do things. One of the overarching facts is that rates have been really coming down overall for more than three decades now. We may be in a world where interest rates are just lower for the time being, and, therefore, we’ll have less policy space to react to economic downturns. And we’d want to be evaluating ideas for—again, for better achieving the goals that Congress has given us. We’re not looking at law changes at all, and we’re not looking at changing the inflation target, for example. We are looking for better ways to achieve the inflation goal—for example, on a symmetric basis. So that’s the sense of that. As I mentioned, on the dot plot—you asked about the dot plot. I think the dot plot generally does provide useful information about the reaction function of Committee participants—sometimes more useful than others, I’ll admit. But, in general, I think people sort on. It’s something that each of us writes down, and we always update it as—you know, as data come in and as we update our outlooks.","Q&A","Press Conf","","305","2018-12"
"2018-12-19","So we do watch all of that, but the amount of—the amount of runoff that we’ve had so far is pretty small. And if you just run the quantitative easing models in reverse, you would get a pretty small adjustment in economic growth and real outcomes. So we don’t think, you know, things that are happening at the short run—at the short end—are driven by many other factors other than the balance sheet runoff. For example, just—very large bill supply has pushed up short-term rates, has pushed up repo rates. Tightening of the federal funds rate has raised short-term borrowing costs. So, you know, we’re alert to these issues. We’re watching them carefully. But we don’t see, you know, the balance sheet runoff as creating significant problems.","Q&A","Press Conf","","127","2018-12"
"2018-12-19","You know, we’re watching—we have a strong forecast, generally, for next year. That forecast involves growth, you know, between 2 and 2½ percent. It involves growth at a strong enough level to continue driving unemployment down and inflation near 2 percent. So that’s a pretty positive forecast. So, to make further moves, I’ll be looking for data that suggests that that’s, in fact, the path that we’re on. As I mentioned, once you—once you’re, broadly speaking, in the range of neutral, I think it’s appropriate to be putting aside individual estimates of that and be looking at what the incoming data are telling you about the outlook, updating your estimates of what neutral might be, of what the natural rate of unemployment might be, of the state of the economy, so—and letting that lead you to adjust your outlook and, therefore, your appropriate path for policy. So that’s what we mean when we say we’re “data dependent.” Of course, we’re always data dependent, but I think it has a particular meaning in this context, which is that.","Q&A","Press Conf","","177","2018-12"
"2018-12-19","Does it currently need to be restrictive? No. And I don’t believe that it is. I don’t believe that policy is restrictive.","Q&A","Press Conf","","22","2018-12"
"2018-12-19","So, if you look at the Tealbook, or—you know, we get the Tealbook in person from the Reserve Bank presidents who come in, and they share their discussions not just with their directors, but with literally hundreds of business and nonprofit, you know, and labor union people around the country.1 And I personally find it really 1 Chairman Powell was referring to the Beige Book, not the Tealbook. capture the picture better. So—and, you know, what—what you’re picking up now, I think, is, there’s, you know, a mood of concern, or it’s a mood of angst about growth going forward, if I could just capture it in one thought. There are many reasons that are given for that, but, generally speaking, it’s—it’s a concern about, is growth going to be as strong as it was? Why not? What might it be—to different people? But that mood is out there. That doesn’t mean that it’ll come into the real data in a big way—it may, but—or that financial conditions will tighten further. We’ll just have to see. For now, financial conditions have tightened a little bit. We’ve taken that on board both in the outcomes, in our forecast, but also in a lower rate path to—you know, to provide some accommodation to push back against that tightening. That’s how I think about it.","Q&A","Press Conf","","222","2018-12"
"2018-12-19","Yes. I mean, I think that’s probably pretty straightforward. If we, you know—if we’re—if we want to communicate something about something that’s going to happen in a future meeting, I think we know how to do that in speeches, in press conferences, and such. there is in the labor market.","Q&A","Press Conf","","50","2018-12"
"2018-12-19","Well, I think we look at both, but core PCE is a good indicator. It has—what’s happened over, really, 50 years is that inflation has become much less reactive to changes in growth. There was a time when inflation reacted really quickly to changes in growth and changes in unemployment, and that time is behind us. And that is often attributed to the success of central banks in anchoring inflation expectations so that people believe that inflation will come back to the target or around the target so it doesn’t go down as much—inflation doesn’t go down as much in a downturn and doesn’t go up as much when the—you know, when the economy is strong. It’s really true, though, that inflation has not reacted a lot on a road from 10 percent unemployment to now 3.7 percent unemployment. Now, it did move up last year. But in terms of just targeting growth, you know, I think—I actually think our dual mandate works very well, which is maximum employment and stable prices. Most of the time, those two things work together. When they work temporarily in different ways, we take a balanced approach. But I think that approach has served us well, and I think we can work well with it.","Q&A","Press Conf","","211","2018-12"
"2018-12-19","I think having regular press conferences will be a big gain for communication. I certainly hope it will. That’s the plan. And so, being able to come out after each meeting and explain the Committee’s thinking and relate that to the state of the economy and expectations for policy and global developments, I think it’ll be—the idea is that it’ll be helpful in explaining how we’re thinking and, you know, explaining what we’re thinking about policy going forward. So that’s the plan. I do believe it will be a positive development. I think it’ll also become the case, over time, that there will be no “prior” as to whether we would move at a quarterly meeting or one of the meetings at which we do not file an","Q&A","Press Conf","","128","2018-12"
"2018-12-19","Well, you’re right, Sam. Inflation has come in just a touch below where we expected it to be—not by a big amount, but by a small amount. More broadly, 2018 has been the strongest year since the recov—since the financial crisis. And during that period we’ve had low unemployment and strong growth, and inflation has still remained just a ultimate destination of any further rate increases.","Q&A","Press Conf","","66","2018-12"
"2018-12-19","So what we’ve seen is, is a very gradual—and, I think, ongoing—increase in wages. If you go back a few years, you’ll see that we look at many, many indicators of wages and compensation. But there are four principal ones. And they were all kind of clustered around 2—if you go back five years ago—2 percent increase per year. Now they are all at 3, and they’ve just continued to gradually move up—not perfectly in sync, but—and that’s a number that is, you know, right in keeping with 2 percent inflation and 1 percent productivity growth. So in an economic sense, it makes sense. I do expect, and I think many forecasters expect, that wage increases will continue, and that would be a welcome development. Wage—wage increases do not need to be inflationary. There’s plenty of evidence of situations—for example, in the very tight labor market of the late 1990s of a—I think I mentioned in a speech a month or so ago, we had wage increases above productivity plus inflation, and we didn’t have high inflation. So it would be welcome. We hear a great deal of anecdotal information about labor shortages, along with other, you know, bottlenecks and things. So I would expect that wages will keep moving up, and it doesn’t necessarily mean inflation. We don’t think of it that way. So did that answer your question?","Q&A","Press Conf","","230","2018-12"
"2018-12-19","Labor slack. Yes. So, you know, by most indicators—we look at a very wide range of indicators on the labor market. And, by most indicators, we are at or even above longer-run normal levels. But I would point to one particular pocket, and that is, labor force participation by younger prime-age workers, particularly prime-age males, is still, question, can we go above that cyclical peak? And—or, or are the problems more structural than cyclical, and that there isn’t—so we’ll have to find that out. I think, given the strong economy, we’ve had the luxury of finding out that labor force participation can be higher than we had thought. And that’s nothing but a good thing.","Q&A","Press Conf","","115","2018-12"
"2018-12-19","So you’re right that a big focus of what we have been doing has been tailoring regulations. And the sense of “tailoring” is that we want to look below the level of the G-SIBs at the large regionals and then on down to the community banks at various steps and ask whether we have appropriately tailored regulation and supervision to account for the fact that smaller and less complex organizations present a much less significant threat to the economy and to the community should they fail—should they experience material difficulty. So, in the nature of that, you’re focused more on the smaller institutions. rule. That’s something we’re working on. You know, we—we think that things need to be looked at carefully. And, again, I wouldn’t want to materially change capital levels, because, I think, you know, it’s important that the largest financial institutions, the largest and most complex—the systemically important ones be held to the highest standards and higher expectations. And while we may tailor some regulations, those fundamentally high expectations are not going to change.","Q&A","Press Conf","","176","2018-12"
"2018-12-19","Again, we do focus on a broad range of financial indicators, and I—really, we don’t obsess about any particular one. You know, we look at a whole range of them, and we ask ourselves, what’s really going on in the broad picture out there? You know, if you ask what’s going on with the long—certainly the long, longer-maturity Treasury market has come in some. That’s consistent with, you know, a risk-off feeling in the stock market as well. And, you know, we don’t know whether that’ll persist. Really, the longer Treasury has moved in a range above 3 percent and down 3 percent as the risk sentiment has changed. You know, I think if rates were to stay low for a longer period of time, that could be thought of as a signal of expectations of lower growth. But, you know, we don’t know that that’ll happen.

"2018-12-19","More broadly, I’m referring to global growth. So, if you go back a year, 2017 was a year of kind of ongoing upside surprises in global growth. It was the year of synchronized global growth. And people raised their forecasts for growth around the world kind of throughout 2017 and, in some sense, expected that to continue into 2018. What has happened instead has been a modest retracing of that.

A little bit of volatility—speaking in the abstract—some volatility doesn’t probably leave a mark on the economy. So we look for that. And, you know, what we’ve seen here is a tightening. There’s been a tightening since right around after—a week or so after the September meeting.

"2018-12-19","Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks very much for being here today. [Cough] Pardon me. Over the past year the economy has been growing at a strong pace, the unemployment rate has been near record lows, and inflation has been low and stable. All of those things remain true today.

"2019-01-30","Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome. I will start with a recap of our discussions, including our assessment of the outlook for the economy and the judgments we made about our interest rate policy and our balance sheet. I will cover the decisions we made today as well as our ongoing discussions of matters on which we expect to make decisions in coming meetings. My colleagues and I have one overarching goal: to sustain the economic expansion, with a strong job market and stable prices, for the benefit of the American people. The We think that our policy is at the appropriate point right now. We think our policy stance is appropriate right now. We do. We also know that our policy rate We had an extensive discussion of the baseline and also of the risks to the baseline, and the risks are, of course, the fact that financial conditions have tightened, that global growth has slowed, as well as some, let’s say, government-related risks like Brexit and trade discussions, and also the effects and ultimate disposition of the shutdown. So we looked at—we look at those, and the way we think of it is that policy—we will use our policy, and we have, to offset risks to the baseline. So we view the baseline as still solid, and part of that is the way we adjusted our baseline to address those risks. So that’s the way we’re thinking about that now. You know, generally speaking, we think the outlook is favorable, and we think that these crosscurrents that I referred to—these risks—are going to be with us for a while. We think our stance is appropriate. We think there’s no pressing need to change our policy stance and no need to rush to judgment there. employment. Remember that our inflation objective is a symmetric one, meaning that we are— we’re always trying to get to 2 percent, and we don’t look at—we look at inflation equally on both sides. So I can’t get into specific hypotheticals, but I do believe that we have a symmetric objective, and I believe we’ll act that way. Sorry—say again what the first question was? Yes. I’m just going to say that the—it’s going to depend entirely on the data. We’re not making a judgment. We don’t have a strong prior. We will be— we will patiently wait and let the data clarify. Some of the crosscurrents that I refer to may be with us for a while, and I think we’ll be looking at seeing those clear up as it relates to—as they relate to the outlook for the You know, it’s really hard to speak about generalities. We’ll be looking at everything, but I do think that, you know, muted inflation pressures—you know, you would want—I would want to see a need for further rate increases, and, for me, a big part of that would be inflation. It wouldn’t be the only thing, but it would certainly be important. Okay. So today I’m here to talk about decisions and also discussions about decisions that haven’t been made. So we’re talking about the latter thing, which is discussions, and so I can’t get ahead of where decisions are. But so the Committee is— what we’re looking to do is create a whole plan that will bring us to our goal, our longer-run goal, which is a balance sheet no larger than it needs to be for us to efficiently conduct— efficiently and effectively conduct monetary policy, but to do so in a way that doesn’t put our goals at risk or result in unnecessary market turmoil. So there are a lot of pieces to that, and we’ve learned over time that it’s—when making these—when designing these plans, like, for example, the original normalization plan, it’s good to take your time. Let the best ideas rise to the top. Let them stand the test of time and argument and then move when you’re really But—so we’ve discussed—there are a number of pieces to that puzzle. There are several different pieces to them, and I think they’re coming—and I’m very pleased with the progress that we’ve made, and, you know, the piece that you mentioned is something that is in those discussions. That’s the first question. I’m not going to give our estimate or ratify anybody else’s estimate of what the equilibrium balance sheet is here today. There are estimates out there, but I’m not at a point today where I’m going to be giving out numbers on that. But there are estimates, and I think they’re consistent with what I said, broadly speaking. Yes, it’s—so, again, we haven’t made any decisions. There no decisions have been made. There are different pieces of the thing, and that is in the discussion as one of many pieces that is in the discussion. And that was reflected in the last minutes, actually. These are great questions. Let me say that the question of the ultimate composition of our balance sheet in the longer run is a very important one, and it’s one that we see ourselves as coming to, you know, fairly soon, as in, in coming meetings. It won’t be the first thing we work on, but it will be one of the first things that we try to resolve. We had discussions at one of the last two meetings on this, and we haven’t come to a judgment on that. And, you know, I wouldn’t comment beyond saying that we understand that’s a key question, and there are, you know, there are issues to be decided. There are benefits and costs to doing— to taking different approaches, and I wouldn’t want to prejudge them today. I’d point to a couple of things. First, the narrative of slowing global growth continues, if you will. The incoming data have shown more of that. We’ve seen that both in China and in Western Europe, and so that’s an important—that has important implications for us, and that story has—let’s just say it continues. And, in addition—I mean, I think important—possibly less important now—probably less important now, but—has been the shutdown, which will leave some sort of imprint on first- second period—second quarter. So those things—in addition, you know, you have to look back. Financial conditions began to tighten in the fourth quarter. And they now have persisted and remain tighter— significantly tighter, let’s say—than they were, and that’s something that we have to take into account as well. So that’s where we are. So, patience—I think we’re going to know in hindsight, because the length of this patient period is going to depend entirely on incoming data and its implications for the outlook. So that’s going to be—so it’s hard to say, you know, it’s hard to think of what to call it at this point or how to label it. So really, your second question is about how do we think about financial conditions. And I would say this: We think about a broad range of financial conditions, not just one or two things. You know, it’s interest rates, it’s risk spreads, it’s currency, it’s the stock market, it’s credit availability, it’s many, many factors. And what matters for financial conditions is, when there are changes and those changes are sustained for a period of time, then they become So we don’t react to, you know, to most things that happen in the financial markets. But when we see a sustained change in financial conditions, then that’s something that has to play into our thinking. In fact, our policy works through changing financial conditions, so it’s sort of the essence of what we do. Right. So, on the first question, I can—we don’t comment on individual investigations or whether they’re happening. I will say that we take our enforcement powers very seriously, and we put them to work when we feel it’s justified. In terms of real-time payments, it’s something we’re very actively working on. As you obviously know, we have some proposals out, and we’re considering them. You know, the thing is, it’s very important in that space to consult with the full range of market participants and interest groups, consumer groups, and we’ve done that, as I’m sure you know, over a period of years. We don’t have plenary authority to just do things, for the most part, in the payment space. We’ve been more of a convener, bringing industry and the public—public interest groups—and all those groups around the table. And we’ve—I think we’ve played a constructive role in that respect, and I believe that will continue. not to raise rates—to stop raising rates. How would you respond to those who would suggest that the Fed just caved to the president’s demands? So what we care about—and, really, the only thing we care about at the Fed—is doing our job for the American people and using our tools appropriately. So that’s very strongly our culture. I think anyone who knows the Fed or who has worked at the Fed would recognize that description. So we’re always going to do what we think is the right thing. We’re never going to take political considerations into account or discuss them as part of our work. You know, we’re human. We make mistakes. But we’re not going to make mistakes of character or integrity. And I would want the public to know that, and I would want them to see that in our actions. I guess the sense of your question is that we could be in a situation in the future—we hope not, but—we could be in a situation where we’d like to cut rates more than we can effectively, and we hit the zero lower bound. We don’t think anything like that is in the cards. Now, there’s no reason to think that it would be. But as we said in today’s release, if that happens, then we’ll use the full range of our tools, and that includes the balance Yes. There would be room to do substantially more. Right. So let me give you the economic side of it first—is that, even with a fairly long shutdown, as long as that’s the end of it and everyone gets their backpay—except the contractors, I guess, the private-sector contractors, but—some people get their backpay, then the lost GDP will be regained in the second quarter. So that’s that. I would say that the—you know, we all see the suffering and the heartbreak and all the pain people go through. I see, you know, federal employees doing their work, and I’m, you know, really grateful they did. I mean, to be doing your work while you’re not getting paid, it’s something we should all be grateful for. Did that answer both your questions? reaching this point again on February 15? So would there be a permanent effect? As I mentioned, there wouldn’t be if there isn’t another shutdown. If there were going to be a permanent effect or a lasting effect, let’s say, it would be from a longer shutdown or perhaps a second shutdown, and that would be through the channel of a loss of confidence in our ability to make policy in the United States. That would be the channel. And I think that was something that we and many others were worried about as there was talk of an even longer shutdown. In terms of ideas for not having more shutdowns, I know Congress is actually looking at some of those, so I think that could be a profitable thing to explore. So, trade—you sound like you’re an avid reader of the Beige Book, and that’s great—the trade, as you will know, then—trade has been a big feature in the Beige Book for some time now. The Beige Book is a collection of all of our—of the comments that our Reserve Bank presidents get from their Districts. It’s incredibly valuable, because you’re getting actual reports from people who are on the line. And there have been real concerns about trade right along the line, both in terms of availability of materials and costs and retaliation and that kind of thing. So that’s been a concern. have an effect on business confidence. So far, the actual amount of tariffs that have been applied both here and in China is not enough to have material effects on GDP either here or in China. So the concern is more a longer—for me—a longer, drawn-out set of negotiations back and forth, which could result in sapping business confidence. Uncertainty is not the friend of business. So, we did—we’ve called out corporate debt as a risk—more of a macroeconomic risk, I think, than a financial stability risk, the sense of that being that if you have companies that are highly levered and we do go into a downturn, they’re going to be less able to weather that and keep serving their customers and, you know, may have to do layoffs and things like that. So they can amplify, in effect, a negative downturn. So we watch that. We also watch carefully for the exposure of the financial system to these companies. In other words, banks are arranging a lot of these loans. The question is, what is their exposure? Do they retain big pieces of the loans? Do they have obligations to underwrite loans which build up in a pipeline? So we monitor those risks very carefully. And, frankly, the banks monitor them much better with our support and help than they did before the crisis. So it’s a concern. It’s something that we’re watching. Of course, you know, November, December, and January were much slower months for those sorts of things. But, you know, it’ll be something that we’re always paying close attention to. average is up more than, like, 500 points. There’s a sense in the market that there’s, you know, what people call the “Powell put” on the markets. Are financial markets wrong in that assessment? You know, I would point to all the continuity here. You know, the thing we did on the balance sheet is something we’ve been working on for, frankly, years— the thing we announced today. And so we’re providing clarity there. I think that’s a constructive thing to do. My—honestly—only motivation is to do the right thing for the economy and for the American people—that’s it. And this situation, I think, calls for patience—I think it does. And it’s just the stance of policy we think is appropriate. We see these uncertainties, and we see a time when we can afford to—we have the luxury of being able to wait and watch, and that’s what we’re planning to do. And I think it’s the right thing. I feel strongly that it is. I’m not going to be able to help you much on that. Those are great questions, and those are questions that are, you know, that our great supervisory people are looking at. I think we’re open to these ideas, but I don’t have any news for you on that today. elsewhere in the world, but I wonder whether it’s possible that slower growth abroad might actually be beneficial to this country, in some respects, at least—for example, perhaps increasing capital inflows and putting downward pressure on long-term rates in this country, as happened in the Asian financial crisis in the late ’90s. You know, Steve, it’s certainly possible. Ultimately, though, you know, a strong global economy is good for us. We export to these countries. We trade with these countries. I mean, part of the story of 2017, for example, was that European growth kept coming in stronger and stronger, and that meant the euro was strong, and that supported our exports. So, ultimately, I think we benefit from having strong growth abroad, although you point to an interesting case. So, first, it is important—we don’t do fiscal policy. We don’t advise the government or Congress on fiscal policy, so I’ll limit myself to more high-level comments and say that it is not a secret—it is a long-known fact that the So, you know, first of all, our—the work that we do relates more to the medium term rather than the long term. And so I don’t see this, in particular, as a threat to this business cycle or to the economy this year. It’s more in the longer run, we’ll be spending all of our money on paying interest and not on the things that we really need to be doing for future generations and for our own generation. So it’s a serious problem, but it’s not a problem that is something that either helps or prevents the Fed from doing our job today. So the range of estimates on the Committee starts at 2½ percent, and that’s kind of roughly where we currently are. And as I’ve said a couple of times, when you get to that range—you know that we can’t directly observe the neutral rate. We Committee members who are, you know, right around that range. And I think we’re watching to see. We don’t—I don’t—again, I think that our policy stance today is appropriate for the state of the economy. That’s my feeling. We’re going to be watching data to see whether that’s right, and we’re also going to be watching data to see how these crosscurrents resolve themselves and how the So we’ve been monitoring the Brexit situation very carefully for a long time. And for us, that starts with Let me be clear. I don’t know that demand for reserves has risen over the past years. I think our understanding of demand for reserves—remember that the banks have more reserves than they need. Reserves are still quite abundant. So the question is, how much of that amount is actually going to be needed in the end after, you know, after the firms adjust to our very gradual decrease? And so our understanding, really, of the distribution of reserves and how much will be needed has moved up over the past year. And then there would be a buffer on top of that. And then we would want to be—we would want to have a buffer, as I mentioned in my remarks, because we want to be operating in an abundant reserves regime where we operate through our administered rates. If you operate too close to that point of scarcity, then you wind up having to have these big, ongoing interventions in the market. We don’t want the Fed to have a, you know, a large ongoing presence in the market around this. We’d rather just, you know—in managing the And, again, there’s no cookbook here, there’s no playbook. No one really knows. The only way you can figure it out is by surveying people and market intelligence and then, ultimately, by approaching that point quite carefully. We don’t take—you know, we don’t think we have a precise understanding of this at all. I want to be clear about that. These estimates are fairly uncertain. So if you think that the level of demand for reserves is here [gesturing with hands together, in the middle], all you can say is, it’s probably somewhere in this range [gesturing with hands apart, equidistant from the middle]. If banks want to use reserves for a good and sufficient reason—which is to say, to hold liquidity as we require them to do to meet the liquidity coverage ratio, to meet their resolution requirements and resolution planning—we’re not going to discourage them from holding them. They are, in fact, a very safe asset—in a way, the safest asset. And we want the banks to be safe and sound. We didn’t create the reserves, you know, with that in mind, but, you know, since—in the post-crisis, you know, regulatory regime, we have brand-new and quite substantial liquidity requirements, which are very good and which have great public benefit. So it’s not a bad thing that banks hold onto these reserves or another safe asset. We don’t—we’re not encouraging them to hold reserves instead of Treasuries. Treasuries or reserves are roughly equivalent for this purpose. How do you balance those two things? I would say that, you know, our mandate is maximum employment and stable prices, and that’s about, you know, hard, real-side economic data. We— as I mentioned earlier, we—our tool, you know, our interest rate tool operates on the economy through financial conditions. So financial conditions matter, and they matter in the way that I suggested earlier—which is to say, broad financial conditions changing over a sustained period—that has implications for the macroeconomy. It does. So if you lower interest rates and they stay low, every borrower in the country ultimately has a lower interest rate. That’ll have an effect on—over time, an effect on the economy. But, again, the entire focus we have is on maximum employment and stable prices, not on any particular financial market or financial conditions generally. You know, I’ll quickly go back—in 2017, we were—in designing the normalization plan, we were concerned at not having two active tools of policy. very transparent so that you could look and know really, certainly as to Treasuries, pretty much the exact amounts and the timing in which we would be returning these assets to private hands. And we put that out there very publicly and in the hope that it would be priced in and understood, and that then we could put the balance sheet on the side and have interest rates be the active tool of policy. So that went along that way very well, and I think that division of labor was a good one for our policy and for the benefit of the country. I think that there’s—I think the market is now looking for more clarity around that, and I think we’ll be providing it. That’s what’s happened. Thanks very much.","Full Text","Press Conf","","3647","2019-01"

"2019-03-08","The crisis revealed that banks, especially the largest and most complex, faced much more liquidity risk than had previously been thought.","General","Speech","N/A","21","2019-03"
"2019-03-08","Because of both new liquidity regulations and improved management, banks now hold much higher levels of high-quality liquid assets than before the crisis.","General","Speech","N/A","23","2019-03"

"2019-03-08","And, third, other liabilities, which are mainly associated with the mechanics of the national and international financial system, will have grown by 1.1 percentage points.","General","Speech","N/A","25","2019-03"
"2019-03-08","As was the case before the crisis, the FOMC's chosen operating regime for controlling short-term interest rates also plays a role in determining the appropriate quantity of reserves.","General","Speech","N/A","28","2019-03"
"2019-03-08","In January, the Committee stated its intention to continue in our current regime in which our main policy rate, the federal funds rate or possibly some successor, is held within its target range by the interest rates we set on reserves and on the overnight reverse repo facility.3In this system, active management of the supply of reserves is not required.","General","Speech","N/A","60","2019-03"
"2019-03-08","Thus, the supply of reserves must be ""ample,"" in the sense of being sufficient to satisfy reserve demands even in the face of volatility in factors affecting the reserve market.4Put another way, the quantity of reserves will equal the typical reserve demands of depositories plus a buffer to allow for reserve market fluctuations.","General","Speech","N/A","53","2019-03"
"2019-03-08","While the precise level of reserves that will prove ample is uncertain, standard projections, such as those in the table, suggest we could be near that level later this year.","General","Speech","N/A","30","2019-03"

"2019-03-08","Without ruling out other topics, we have highlighted three questions that seem particularly important at present (figure 4):","General","Speech","N/A","18","2019-03"
"2019-03-08","Can the Federal Reserve best meet its statutory objectives with its existing monetary policy strategy, or should it consider strategies that aim to reverse past misses of the inflation objective?","General","Speech","N/A","30","2019-03"
"2019-03-08","Are the existing monetary policy tools adequate to achieve and maintain maximum employment and price stability, or should the toolkit be expanded?","General","Speech","N/A","22","2019-03"
"2019-03-08","How can the FOMC's communication of its policy framework and implementation be improved?","General","Speech","N/A","13","2019-03"
"2019-03-08","I would like to spend a few minutes discussing the first topic.","General","Speech","N/A","12","2019-03"
"2019-03-08","Because interest rates around the world have steadily declined for several decades, rates in normal times now tend to be much closer to zero than in the past (figure 5).8Thus, when a recession comes, the Fed is likely to have less capacity to cut interest rates to stimulate the economy than in the past, suggesting that trips to the ELB may be more frequent.","General","Speech","N/A","64","2019-03"
"2019-03-08","The post-crisis period has seen many economies around the world stuck for an extended period at the ELB, with slow growth and inflation well below target.","General","Speech","N/A","26","2019-03"
"2019-03-08","Persistently weak inflation could lead inflation expectations to drift downward, which would imply still lower interest rates, leaving even less room for central banks to cut interest rates to support the economy during a downturn.","General","Speech","N/A","35","2019-03"
"2019-03-08","It is therefore very important for central banks to find more effective ways to battle the low-inflation syndrome that seems to accompany proximity to the ELB.","General","Speech","N/A","26","2019-03"
"2019-03-08","In the late 1990s, motivated by the Japanese experience with deflation and sluggish economic performance, economists began developing the argument that a central bank might substantially reduce the economic costs of ELB spells by adopting a makeup strategy.9The simplest version goes like this: If a spell with interest rates near the ELB leads to a persistent shortfall of inflation relative to the central bank's goal, once the ELB spell ends, the central bank would deliberately make up for the lost inflation by stimulating the economy and temporarily pushing inflation modestly above the target.","General","Speech","N/A","93","2019-03"
"2019-03-08","In standard macroeconomic models, if households and businesses are confident that this future inflationary stimulus will be coming, that prospect will promote anticipatory consumption and investment.","General","Speech","N/A","26","2019-03"
"2019-03-08","This can substantially reduce the economic costs of ELB spells.10Researchers have suggested many variations on makeup strategies.11For example, the central bank could target average inflation over time, implying that misses on either side of the target would be offset.","General","Speech","N/A","39","2019-03"
"2019-03-08","By the time of the crisis, there was a well-established body of model-based research suggesting that some kind of makeup policy could be beneficial.12In light of this research, one might ask why the Fed and other major central banks chose not to pursue such a policy.13The answer lies in the uncertain distance between models and reality.","General","Speech","N/A","56","2019-03"
"2019-03-08","For makeup strategies to achieve their stabilizing benefits, households and businesses must be quite confident that the ""makeup stimulus"" is really coming.","General","Speech","N/A","22","2019-03"
"2019-03-08","We believe that our existing framework for conducting monetary policy has generally served the public well, and the review may or may not produce major changes.","General","Speech","N/A","26","2019-03"
"2019-03-08","In short, as Chairman Bernanke explained, the SEP projections are merely ""inputs"" to policy that do not convey ""the risks, the uncertainties, all the things that inform our collective judgment.","General","Speech","N/A","30","2019-03"
"2019-03-08","While this is the first time the Fed has opened itself up in this way, many central banks around the world have conducted similar reviews, and our approach builds on their experiences.","General","Speech","N/A","32","2019-03"

"2019-03-20","Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome. I will begin with an overview of economic conditions and an explanation of the decisions the Committee made at today’s meeting. My colleagues and I have one overarching goal: to sustain the economic expansion, with a strong job market and stable prices, for the benefit of the American people. The So, on the outlook, our outlook is a positive one. So, as I mentioned, FOMC participants continue to see growth this year of around 2 percent, just a bit below what we saw back in—at the end of last year. And part of that is seeing that economic fundamentals—underlying economic fundamentals are still very strong. You have a strong labor market by most measures. You have rising incomes. You’ve got very low unemployment. You have confidence surveys for households and also for businesses that are at attractive levels, and you also have financial conditions that are more accommodative than they were a couple of months ago. So we see the outlook as a positive one. As far as balance sheet—the balance sheet plan, the answer to that is, you asked whether that’s related to our monetary policy, in effect, and the answer is really “no.” We are—we still— we think of the interest rate tool as the principal tool of monetary policy, and we think of ourselves as returning the balance sheet to a normal level over the course of the next six months. And we’re not really thinking of those as two different tools of monetary policy. So the global economy was a tailwind for the United States in 2017. That was the year of synchronized global growth. And we began 2018 expecting and hoping for more of the same. What happened instead is that the global economy started to gradually slow, was a tailwind, weaker global growth can be a headwind to our economy. How big is that effect? It’s hard to be precise about it, but, clearly, we will feel that. It is an integrated global economy, and global financial markets are integrated as well. In terms of what’s causing it, it seems to be a range of different things. In China, you have, you know, factors that are very specific to China. The main point, though, is that, I would say, the outlook—let’s look at the outlook. Chinese authorities have taken many steps since the middle of last year to support economic activity, and I think the base case is that, ultimately, Chinese activity will stabilize at an attractive level. And in Europe, you know, we see some weakening, but, again, we don’t see—we don’t see recession, and we do see positive growth still. You ask about tariffs. I would say, tariffs may be a factor in China. I don’t think they’re the main factor. I think the main factors are the delevering campaign that the government undertook a couple of years ago and also just the longer-term slowing to a more sustainable pace of growth that economies find as they mature. In terms of our own economy, the level of tariffs is relatively small in the size of our economy—relative to the size of our economy. We have, since the beginning of the year—and before, really—been hearing from our extensive network of business contacts a lot of concerns about tariffs, concerns about material costs on imported products, and the loss of markets and things like that, depending on which industry, so there’s a fair amount of uncertainty. It’s hard to say how much of an effect that’s having on our economy. It’s very hard to tease that apart. But I will say, it’s been a prominent concern among our business contacts for some time now. 5 percent pay raise last year, and this comes among continued settlements by the bank of various consumer abuse and reports that new consumer-unfriendly sales incentives are returning. Do you have concerns about Wells Fargo’s efforts to fix its problems, and do you expect the asset cap to remain in place beyond this year? Wells Fargo. So what happened at Wells Fargo really was a remarkably widespread series of breakdowns, really, in their risk-management apparatus, which resulted in significant consumer abuses, let’s say. And as it’s gone on and on, it’s become clear that—I think some time ago it became clear that these are deep problems that needed to be addressed in a fundamental kind of a way. So there’s a lot of work to do on that. And we put in place, really, an unprecedented sanction in the form of an asset growth cap, and we will not lift that until Wells Fargo gets their arms around this, comes forward with plans, implements those plans, and we’re satisfied with what they’ve done. And that’s not where we are right now. You know, our main supervisory focus is on the company fixing its risk-management approach and fundamentally rebuilding that approach. We don’t approve individual pay packages. We do supervise boards of directors for, you know, for having a set of compensation practices that don’t reward short-term risk-taking and that sort of thing. And we will supervise based on that. members is a positive one, but since the end of the meeting, the 3-month–10-year Treasury spread has fallen to 7 basis points, and now, according to fed funds futures trading, there’s a 50 percent chance of a rate cut by next January. How far off are the markets? What do you think the risks actually are? Well, first, the data are not currently sending a signal that we need to move in one direction or another, in my view. I would say it this way: We see a positive outlook for this year, a favorable outlook for this year, as I mentioned. So, in our SEP projections, Committee members, participants, generally see growth of around 2 percent. They see unemployment remaining below 4 percent. They see inflation remaining close to target. And they see growth, as I said, around 2 percent. So, you know, that’s a positive outlook. It’s a favorable outlook. We’re also very mindful—and we have been, of course, all along—of what the risks are. And you see—you mentioned some of them. You know, you see slowing global growth. You still have—there’s no resolution of Brexit. There’s no resolution, really, of the trade talks. These are ongoing risks. We’re also carefully monitoring what’s happening with I haven’t—I haven’t seen their projection. I wouldn’t comment on their projection. I would take it this way. You can think of growth as being composed of two things. And one is really growth in the workforce—more hours worked. And the other is productivity—it’s output per hour. You can really think of growth as those two things. And I’ve been calling—often mentioning these days that it would be great if we had national-level policies to support higher labor force participation. The United States is now one of the lowest countries among the advanced economies, in terms of our labor force participation by prime-age workers. And that’s a place where we can grow faster. If we can bring more people into the labor force and give them a chance to contribute to and benefit from our overall prosperity, that will be a great thing for the country. So I would like to see that. Productivity is much harder. It’s very difficult to project productivity over long stretches of time. It’s a function of evolving technology. So, I guess I would say, what is the potential growth rate? It’s quite hard to know with any precision, and I just would like to see us, you know, undertake an effort to make it be as high as it can sustainably be. I would say so. I think it’s clear that the tax and spending policies that were adopted early last year supported demand in a significant way last year. And it’s also the case, I think, that they should have some supply-side effects. I think it’s hard to know, it’s hard to identify those with any precision, and we hope they’re—we hope they’re very large. You force participation. I wouldn’t want to be handing—you know, assigning credit or blame for that, but I do think that the performance of labor force participation over the last, really, three or four years has been an upside surprise that most people didn’t see coming, and it’s extremely welcome. As I mentioned, the data that we’re seeing are not currently sending a signal which suggests moving in either direction for me, which is really why we’re being patient. We feel our policy rate is in the range of neutral. The economy is growing at about trend. Inflation is close to target. Unemployment is under 3 percent.1 It’s a great time for us to be patient and watch and wait and see how things evolve. So you mentioned the qualitative aspect of So on the household side, what we saw was a very weak reading on retail sales in December and then a bounceback in the January reading. And, you know, it was a It’s 70 percent of the economy, as you point out. It’s strong economic underlying fundamentals, so, rising wages, high levels of employment, low levels of unemployment, high levels of job creation, confidence. The household confidence surveys have moved back up to where they were last summer. So we look at those fundamentals, and we think that looks like a setting in which consumption will have support from underlying economic fundamentals. And that’s really what we’re thinking there. So, you know, we’re also patiently watching and waiting and not assuming. We’re not taking no signal from the incoming data; that’s why we called it out in our statement. So I think our eyes are open on this. We’re in a very different world today and post-crisis, because we now very carefully monitor financial conditions and financial stability concerns on an ongoing basis, and we publish a report twice a year, and we have quarterly Board meetings and briefings where we look deeply into these things. So this is something we have very much on our radar screen. And I would say, overall, we don’t see financial stability vulnerabilities as high. There are some aspects of the financial markets that we’re carefully monitoring, and those are in the do monitor that. And I would also say, you know, that the whole question of monetary policy and financial stability is an unsettled and difficult one in our world. We do think that the principal tools for, you know, for managing financial stability are regulation, supervision, macroprudential tools, and those sorts of things as opposed to changing the interest rate. But we’re certainly very mindful of financial conditions and those risks. It’s a very difficult question with a long answer. We—in our system, we mainly rely on “through the cycle” tools like high capital and stress tests. Our financial stability system is built on those tools: high capital, high liquidity, resolution planning, stress testing. So those are always on. We also have some tools, like the countercyclical capital buffer, which we can deploy at times when vulnerabilities are meaningfully above normal. But we do rely on those tools. And I would say, our banks are well capitalized. They’re far better capitalized and better aware of their risks and more liquid than they were before the financial crisis. So they’ll be more resilient in, you know, in difficult states of the economy. I do think that deficits matter, and I do think—I think it’s not really controversial to say that our debt can’t grow faster than our economy indefinitely and that’s what it’s doing now. So this is something we will have to deal with, and I think we can’t really lose sight of that, and I’d like to see a greater focus on that over time. It’s not in the nature of a near- term debt crisis or anything like that, and I wouldn’t want to try to predict when that would happen, but it is something that it’s important that the public discussion really come back to, if I can say that. And we will have to deal with it eventually. So, of course, we’re watching Brexit carefully and hoping that it can be resolved in an orderly way. From our standpoint, the part of it that we can control is that we’ve been involved with supervising our financial institutions that are active either in the United Kingdom or the European Union or both to make sure that they’re ready for the full range of possible outcomes to the—to Brexit. So—and in doing so, we’ve also had—we’ve also worked alongside regulators from the United Kingdom and the EU. So we do, again, hope that that can be resolved well, but we know that our banks are well capitalized and resilient to different kinds of events. the end of 2014—so, significantly smaller relative to GDP than it was. I’m guessing you’re looking for a dollar number, though, probably, and that would be—so, for the size of the balance sheet, it looks like it’ll be a bit above $3.5 trillion then. Let me take wages first, if I can. So wages have moved up in the last couple of years and are now running at healthier, higher levels, and that’s a good thing. In fact, a lot of the wage gains have been going to lower-paid workers, as can happen late in the cycle, which is also a good thing. So—but that’s not price inflation, that’s wage inflation. Our mandate, sorry, is price inflation. So what I see is inflation that’s close to 2 percent but that sort of keeps bumping up against 2 percent and then maybe moving back down a little bit. And I don’t feel that we have kind of convincingly achieved our 2 percent mandate in a symmetrical way. Now, what do we mean by “symmetrical”? What we really mean is that we would look at—we know that inflation will move around on both sides of the target, and what we say is that we would be equally concerned with inflation persistently above as persistently below the target. So that’s really our framework. And I don’t think we’ve quite achieved that yet, because we’re really 10 years deep in this—almost 10 years—in this expansion, and inflation is still kind of, I’d say, not, you know, clearly meeting our target. So that’s one of the reasons why we’re being patient. I think, as I’ve said before, I think inflation that is a little bit below our target— the ability to be patient and not move until we see that our target goals are being achieved. So there are a bunch of different stories. There’s no real easy answer. One of them is just that the natural rate of unemployment is lower than people think. That’s one way to think about it, that there’s still more slack in the economy. Another is that expectations play a very—inflation expectations play a very key role in our framework and other frameworks, and, you know, there is the possibility that some people discuss of expectations being anchored but below 2 percent. And so, either way, inflation itself has kind of bounced around a little below 2 percent. That’s the record. It’s a major challenge. It’s one of the major challenges of our time, really, to have inflation—you know, downward pressure on inflation, let’s say. It gives central banks less room to, you know, to respond to downturns, right? So if inflation expectations are below 2 percent, they’re always going to be pulling inflation down, and we’re going to be paddling upstream in trying to, you know, keep inflation at 2 percent, which gives us some room one of the—one of the things we’re looking into as part of our strategic monetary policy review this year. The proximity to the zero lower bound calls for more creative thinking about ways we can, you know, uphold the credibility of our inflation target, and, you know, we’re open minded about ways we can do that. Well, we—I think we were—we wanted to be careful to go ahead and acknowledge the things. I think it’s relatively little hard data so far this year, but we were careful to point out lower retail sales—the weak November meeting—BFI, all those things, and I think that was the right thing to do.2 Notwithstanding that, we do have a positive outlook for the year for the reasons I mentioned—you know, solid underlying economic fundamentals, et cetera. So, and in terms of what it would take, I’d say, again, today we don’t see any—we don’t see data coming in that suggests that we should move in either direction. They suggest that we should remain patient and let the situation clarify itself over time. When the time comes, we’ll act appropriately. Well, let me say that we’ve had, you know, a significant move up in wages and compensation over the last few years, and I—which does not trouble me from the standpoint of inflation. We’ve had—also had—in other cycles, we’ve had situations where, you know, unit labor costs were moving up above inflation, and that didn’t lead to price inflation. It does—you know, in theory, it can squeeze corporate margins, and, you know, that can’t go on indefinitely. But, nonetheless, I don’t see the current wage picture as concerning from an inflation standpoint. I don’t think we look at—I understand what you’re asking, but we’re looking at—our mandate is price inflation and maximum employment, and that’s what we’re looking at with setting interest rates. And we also monitor financial stability very carefully across all meaningful asset categories. I don’t think we tie it particularly to the relationship you’re talking about. Well, as I mentioned, you know, with the stress tests that the largest financial institutions—and those are the ones that tend to be active internationally—that they undergo every year, we put them through very large financial shocks with large losses and big changes in markets every year. And we vary that every year. So that’s a pretty good—you know, having done that for a number of years now, that’s—and having them be required to have adequate capital and liquidity even after all that happens. So that’s a good thing to have done, knowing that you’re going into something that’s quite unknown, which may prove stressful, it may not prove stressful, depending on what the outcome is. So I think all that has probably prepared our institutions well. That said, nothing like this has happened in recent years, and so it’s really hard to be confident. So we’re very watchful about what’s going on. So we don’t—you know, we—the dollar is really the business of the Treasury Department. It’s certainly a financial condition unto itself that plays into our models, but we don’t, you know, seek or model or attempt to affect the dollar directly with our policies. So we take—we take fiscal policy as, you know, as exogenous to what we do. You know, in other words, whatever happens with fiscal policy, we take that. We don’t evaluate it, we don’t criticize it, and we don’t overreact to it either. So I think it’s just a fact. It’s just an external fact about the economy for us. I mean, our policy is—the reason we’re and we think that’s what we need to be doing. The basic answer to your question is “no.” We are—the decision about the maturity composition of the Fed’s balance sheet in the longer run lies ahead of us. We have not made that decision, and we’re—we really haven’t begun to have a serious series of discussions over a series of meetings to grapple with that. That, I think, will be something we turn to reasonably soon, but I think it will take some time. It’s a consequential decision and one that needs some thought. We’ve had a lot of balance sheet discussions, as I mentioned, over the last four meetings, but this is the next big one that—big decision that we’ll face. And, you know, I think we’re not going to be in a rush to resolve it, but we’ll turn to it soon. I think, isn’t it just that as securities roll off, you wind up investing in—you know, as a 10-year rolls off, you wind up investing in a 10-year, and automatically that So, as I—as I mentioned, the balance sheet runoff will stop at about—at September 30. And if it is our view at that time that we’re still a ways away from—a ways above a balance sheet that is what we need to efficiently and effectively conduct monetary policy, at that time we will hold the balance sheet constant. And then what’ll happen is, organically, very gradually, currency and other nonreserved liabilities will grow, and reserves will shrink. And the question you’re asking is, how long will that go on? The truth is, we don’t know, and we don’t really know that we’ll move past September 30th. The level of reserve demand is something that we’ve put a lot of effort and time into creating estimates, based on market intelligence and surveys and that kind of thing. The truth is, we don’t know. It may evolve over time. So we’ll just have to see. I wouldn’t want to put a time out there for that, but—so I’ll just leave it there.

"2019-05-01","Good afternoon, and welcome. At the FOMC meeting that concluded today, we reviewed economic and financial developments in the United States and around the world and decided to leave our policy interest rate unchanged. My colleagues and I have one overarching goal: to use our monetary policy tools to sustain the economic expansion with a strong job market and stable prices for the benefit of the American people. Incoming data since our last meeting in March have been broadly in line with our expectations. Economic growth and job creation have both been a bit stronger than we anticipated, while inflation has been somewhat weaker. Overall, the economy continues on a healthy path, and the Committee believes that the current stance of policy is appropriate. The Committee also believes that solid underlying fundamentals are supporting the economy, including accommodative financial conditions, high employment and job growth, rising wages, and strong consumer and business sentiment. Job gains rebounded in March after a weak reading in February and averaged 180,000 per month in the first quarter, well above the pace needed to absorb new entrants to the labor force. Although first-quarter GDP rose more than most forecasters had expected, growth in private consumption and business fixed investment slowed. Recent data suggest that these two components will bounce back, supporting our expectation of healthy GDP growth over the rest of the year. The Committee is strongly committed to our symmetric 2 percent inflation objective. For much of this long expansion, inflation ran a bit below our 2 percent objective, alongside considerable slack in resource utilization. But last year, with the unemployment rate at or below 4 percent, inflation moved up. From March through December, core inflation—which excludes volatile food and energy components—was at or very close to 2 percent. Overall inflation this year as earlier oil price declines worked through the system. Overall inflation for the 12 months ended in March was 1.5 percent. Core inflation unexpectedly fell as well, however, and as of March stood at 1.6 percent for the previous 12 months. We suspect that some transitory factors may be at work. Thus, our baseline view remains that, with a strong job market and continued growth, inflation will return to 2 percent over time and then be roughly symmetric around our longer-term objective. At the start of the year, a number of crosscurrents presented risks to the outlook, including weak global growth, particularly in China and Europe; the possibility of a disruptive Brexit; and uncertainty around unresolved trade negotiations. While concerns remain in all of these areas, it appears that risks have moderated somewhat. Global financial conditions have eased, supported in many places around the world by an accommodative shift in monetary policy and, in some cases, fiscal policy. Recent data from China and Europe show some improvement, and the prospect of a disorderly Brexit has been pushed off for now. Further, there are reports of progress in the trade talks between the United States and China. The Committee views these developments, along with the outlook for continued growth, a strong job market, and muted inflation pressures, as consistent with continued patience in assessing further adjustments in monetary policy. Over the past several months, we have made a number of consequential decisions about our balance sheet. In January, we decided to continue implementing monetary policy using our current policy regime, which involves providing an ample supply of reserves. In March, we decided to slow the pace of balance sheet runoff, starting this month, and to cease runoff entirely Today we had a preliminary discussion about the longer-run maturity composition of the portfolio. Before the financial crisis, our portfolio was weighted toward shorter-term debt of the federal government. In the wake of the crisis, the Fed bought a large amount of longer-term securities with the aim of lowering longer-term interest rates and, thus, supporting the recovery. Because of these purchases, our portfolio is now weighted toward longer-term securities. As part of normalization, we will have to decide what the maturity structure should be in the longer term. This choice raises many complex issues and has possible implications for the stance of policy. Today’s preliminary discussion laid the groundwork for more complete analysis and discussion, and we plan to return to the maturity composition question toward the end of the year. There is no pressing need to resolve this matter, however, and any decisions we ultimately reach will be implemented with considerable advance notice and in a manner that allows for smooth adjustment. As we have often emphasized, adjustments to the balance sheet normalization process may well be needed as the process unfolds. Finally, we made a small technical adjustment in one of our tools for implementing monetary policy: the interest rate on excess reserves, or IOER rate. The change does not reflect any shift in the intended stance of monetary policy. We use the IOER rate to help keep the federal funds rate in our target range. As balance sheet normalization continues, we have expected that the effective federal funds rate would shift up over time relative to the IOER rate. Last year we twice lowered the IOER rate by 5 basis points relative to the top of the target range after the federal funds rate moved toward the top of the range. These actions helped keep the effective federal funds rate well within the target range. And today we made one more such Thank you very much. I will be glad to take your questions. So, first, we are strongly committed to our 2 percent inflation objective and to achieving it on a sustained and symmetric basis. As I mentioned, we think our policy stance is appropriate at the moment, and we don’t see a strong case for moving in either direction. I would point out that inflation actually ran—including core inflation—actually ran pretty close to 2 percent for much of 2018. As you point out, both headline and core, though, did come in on the soft side in the first quarter, and that was not expected as it relates to core. So we say in our Statement of Longer- Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy that the Committee would be concerned if inflation were running persistently above or below 2 percent. So “persistent” carries the sense of something that’s not transient, something that will sustain over a period of time. And in this case, as we look at these readings in the first quarter for core, we do see good reasons to think that some or all of the unexpected decrease may wind up being transient. And I’d point to things like portfolio management, service prices, apparel prices, and other things. In addition, the But to go back to your question, if we did see a persistent—inflation running persistently below, then that is something the Committee would be concerned about and something that we would take into account in setting policy. So as I mentioned, we’ve just come through a two-day meeting, and we’ve done a deep dive on economic and financial conditions in the United States and around the world and thought about our policy, and we do think our policy stance is appropriate right now. We don’t see a strong case for moving in either direction. So— we do, of course, though—as a routine matter, as you well know—we look not only at our baseline, but we also look at alternative simulations, both better and worse, and we ask ourselves what the appropriate policy response would be. But that’s all we do. And I would just say that we’re comfortable—the Committee is comfortable with our current policy stance. So a small, temporary deviation outside of the range would really carry no—wouldn’t be important, as your question suggests. But we do think it’s important that we be able to control the federal funds rate and generally keep it within the range. That’s just good monetary policy, good monetary control. So we think it’s important, and we have the tools to do that, so we’ve used them again today. And, again, this is just a technical fix. It really has no implications for policy. Yes, I mean—so, generally speaking, the federal funds rate—we control only directly the federal funds rate in terms of the market rate. And the transmission of the federal funds rate into other short-term rates—money market rates—has been very good over a long period of time. And that’s important, because it’s really broader financial conditions that matter, not so much precisely the federal funds rate. So I think the Fed controlling the federal funds rate is actually important from that standpoint, and I don’t see us not controlling it. So I think we’ll continue to control it, and it will continue to transmit well into broader financial conditions. We actually have a financial stability briefing and opportunity for comment every other meeting. So we had our quarterly briefing today—yesterday, as a matter of fact—and had that discussion as well. And I think there haven’t been a lot of changes since the last meeting, but I’ll just go through the way we think about it. First, we’ve developed and published our framework for assessing financial stability vulnerabilities—put it out for comment and welcome any feedback that we get from the public. And that enables us to focus our assessments regularly on the same things so that we can be held accountable and be transparent. So there are four aspects of it that I’ll go through quickly, but I’d say that the headline really is that while there are some concerns around nonfinancial corporate debt, really the finding is that, overall, financial stability vulnerabilities are moderate, on balance. And, in addition, I would say that the financial system is quite resilient to shocks of various kinds with high capital and liquidity. But the four things we look at are, first, asset prices. And as for asset prices, some asset prices are somewhat elevated, but I would say not extremely so. Leverage in the financial sector—I mentioned households are actually in good shape from a leverage standpoint. Default rates are low. Borrowing is relatively low. Nonfinancial corporates is an area that we’ve spotlighted and focused on for attention, and there are concerns about that—not so much from a financial stability standpoint, but from the standpoint that having a highly levered corporate sector could be an amplifier for a downturn. States. So, on balance, in my view, vulnerabilities are moderate. So we do say that risks to the financial system—we say in our longer-run statement of goals and monetary policy strategy that risks to the financial system that could prevent us from achieving our goals are something that we do take into consideration. I would say that, though, that really the tools for addressing those concerns are better—capital liquidity, good supervision, good stress testing, and things like that. Those are better first-order tools to deal with these kinds of issues than monetary policy. So, to your first question, if you go back and think about the middle of last year, inflation was at 2 percent and appeared to be staying there. And the economy was quite strong and was growing strong. The fiscal changes were hitting the economy in a very positive way. And so I think the expectation was that inflation would remain up around 2 percent. The weak first quarter performance was not expected—of core was not expected, and I don’t think is related to anything we did, in terms of raising rates. It appears to be more—we Yes, I mean—so, as I said earlier, we do address this in our, sort of, constitutional document. If inflation were to run persistently below 2 percent or persistently above 2 percent, that would be a concern for the Committee, and the Committee would take that into account in making policy. I do think it’s important that inflation run close to and sustainably —for a sustained period of time—and symmetrically around 2 percent. Because if it doesn’t, you run the risk that inflation expectations can—it has been the case, most of the misses are on the downside—inflation expectations over time could be pulled down, and that could put downward pressure on inflation and make it harder for us to react to downturns and harder for us to, you know, support the economy in difficult times. Inflation, first of all—month-to-month, quarter-to-quarter—is going to move around. There will always be factors hitting it. So probably the biggest single factor driving it is the rate of underlying inflation or the closely related idea of where inflation economy does play some small role. It’s actually still a measurable role. It’s nothing like it was in the 1960s when the Phillips curve was quite steep, so that’s also something that plays a role. And so we take all those things into account, and the part of it that we can control is the slack part. And, again, we do expect that this reading will be transient and inflation will move back up. And if it isn’t and if it runs persistently below 2 percent for a sustained period, then that’s something we’d take into account in setting policy. You know, I think, generally, I’d have to see the data on that. It sounds like you picked a particular time frame. Over time, I really wonder whether that’s the case. You know, I think men and women should make the same for the same work, by and large. So— So I think we’re getting in here to commenting on a nominee to the Fed indirectly, and that’s something I’d rather avoid. It’s really not my role to engage with potential nominees to the Fed, so I’m really not going to go there. I haven’t seen this research either, so I don’t really—really know. Thanks. talk about what happened there, how long it lasted, whether you know what happened, whether you’re still looking into it, and whether it’s something that could happen again. Sure. So that’s right. I want to say it was April 1, but it may have been April 2. In any case, the Fedwire® did go down for a few hours, in the three- or four-hour range. We were able to quickly identify the problem: It was an internal problem, and we were able to correct it and make changes so that that problem and other problems like it cannot repeat themselves. So, you know, we learn from these instances. They’re fairly rare, but we learn from them, and in this case it was internal, and it’s been corrected. You know, I wouldn’t want to speculate. There’s always the example of Australia that everyone, I think, is aware of, where I think they’re in year 28 of their expansion. So things are possible. All I can see is that we have an economy where the expansion is continuing. Growth is at a healthy level. The labor market is strong. We see job creation. We see wages moving up. Inflation is low, which gives us the ability to be patient, and we do expect it to move up, and we want it to move up to 2 percent. So I see us on a good path for this year. 1995, and rates went up, and then they came down, and there was that kind of management. Do you see similarities in today’s situation? Similarities in the length. I mean, the situations were quite different then. This was before inflation really was under control, but, you know, it’s very interesting to look at the history. I find it quite interesting to look at different periods. But I think, in our own cycle, we face a particular set of challenges that are really what’s relevant for us now. Yes, so, as you know, we are a nonpolitical institution, and that means we don’t think about short-term political considerations, we don’t discuss them, and we don’t consider them in making our decisions one way or the other. And what we’re always solving for in our process, in our work, is to carry out our mission, which is to extend the economic expansion, keep the labor market strong, and get inflation around 2 percent. So to give you an idea of what our process is like, maybe as a way of putting all that in context—so for the past maybe 10 days, all 17 FOMC members will have made extensive preparations: catching up on the latest data, reading all the memos, talking to their colleagues and their staff. As you also are I’m sure aware, Marty, we talk to literally thousands of two days. The first day begins with an economic briefing, which is, sort of, economic and financial developments in the United States and around the world. That takes up most of the first day, and we talk about this in great detail. We go away, we think about that, and we come back, and the next day we talk about monetary policy. And in this particular case, we came to a unanimous decision, after an extensive discussion, that our monetary policy stance is appropriate where it is. And we think our monetary policy stance is in a good place, and we’re going to be patient as we consider adjustments. And we also see, by the way, the evolving-risk picture as very consistent with that outlook. So we don’t feel like the data’s pushing us in either direction. Of course, we’ll not hesitate if we do feel that the data justify moving in either direction. But that’s our process. That’s how we think about things. We don’t think about other factors. We don’t let them into our decisionmaking. We don’t discuss them. Yes. So you’re pointing to, really, the fact that in recent years inflation has moved down and down, and, really, many major central banks have struggled to reach their inflation goals from below. And that includes us, although we’ve actually done— creates significant challenges. One, I would say, is, it means that interest rates will be lower— will be closer to the effective lower bound more of the time because that means lower interest rates. And that’s one of the reasons we’re having a review of our monetary policy strategies, tools, and communications this year—to think about that problem. You mentioned the connection to financial stability of lower-for-longer rates, and that is another challenge. As I mentioned earlier, we do consider financial stability concerns to the extent they threaten achievement of our goals, but we also view, and I do take the view that macroprudential and supervisory tools, regulatory tools, things like the stress tests that we can do right through the cycle—those are really the best defense against financial instability so that the financial system is highly resilient to the kinds of financial shocks that can happen. This is the ISM reading, I guess from this morning, on manufacturing. Yes, we see that reading as—it’s still a positive reading and consistent with what we expect from the manufacturing sector, which is moderate or perhaps modest growth. Manufacturing has been weak all around the world. Services have been growing faster. So it’s—yes, it’s something that we are watching carefully, but we do expect a positive contribution to growth from the manufacturing sector. economy. You mentioned that the progress in the talks with China trade, progress in talks with Japanese trade, the USMCA is moving or going to move through Congress. Could you talk about a little bit of the domestic growth that you’re seeing going forward for the rest of the year? And could these trade deals turn into tailwinds for the economy? Our outlook and my outlook is for—is a positive one, is a healthy one for the Sure. Well, I would just mention a couple. Let me say, I don’t mean to diminish concerns about too-low inflation, but I think there’s good reason to think that these readings are particularly influenced by some transitory factors. One that I would mention is portfolio management services, which would tend to go down when asset prices go down, with a lag. And so when asset prices went back up, probably there’ll be a swing around there, a positive contribution. Other ones that get mentioned are things like apparel, and apparel prices were very, very low. There was a change in the methodology. And another one is airfares. There are many little things. So we don’t know until, again, until we see, but there’s reason to think that those would be transient and would turn around. And another way to look at it is, there are models that look at inflation in different ways, like—not models, but measures, like the Dallas trimmed mean, as I mentioned. So trimmed mean—it cuts off the big movements on the upside and the downside and looks at just the mean movements in inflation of various product categories and service categories, and it didn’t go down at all. It’s at 2 percent—or it’s at, I don’t know whether it went down or was above that, but it’s at 2 percent now. So there’s reason to think that these will be transient. We, of course, will be watching very carefully to see that that is the case. I would point to the case of cell phone services. Many of you will remember, in March of 2017, there was a would be repeated. And we kind of thought so and said so, and then, sure enough, in 2018, we had those months of 2 percent inflation. So, again, we’ll have to see here. We’re going to be watching—really, I’d like to say we’re going to be watching inflation carefully to see that these things are transient, and I’ll end by saying we are strongly committed to the 2 percent inflation objective. Yes, it’s hard to say, because there’s so many other variables. Ultimately, there are many variables to be taken into account at any given time, but that’s part of our mandate. Stable prices is half of our mandate, and we’ve defined that as 2 percent. So we would be concerned, and we’d take it into account. I can’t really be any more specific than what I’ve said. Well, we don’t see any evidence at all of overheating, for one thing. We see inflation below 2 percent now—as I mentioned, pretty close to 2 percent for most of last year. So, really, no signs of overheating. If you look at the labor market, for a long time now there have been anecdotal reports of labor shortages and difficulty in finding skilled labor and that kind of thing. Nonetheless, you have very strong job creation, and you have wages moving up at a rate that is appropriate, given inflation and given productivity, but not at all signaling any overheating at all. It’s not higher than that rate that would incorporate both inflation and productivity. So, really not seeing signs of overheating at the moment.","Full Text","Press Conf","","3815","2019-05"

"2019-06-04","In fact, the review is still in its early stages.","General","Speech","N/A","10","2019-06"
"2019-06-04","The first question raises the issue of whether the FOMC should use makeup strategies in response to ELB risks.","General","Speech","N/A","19","2019-06"
"2019-06-04","By the time of the 1999 conference, research was beginning to show that—in models, at least—such strategies could substantially reduce the unemployment and other costs of ELB spells.8The simplest version goes like this: Suppose that a spell with interest rates near the ELB leads to a persistent shortfall of inflation relative to the central bank's goal.","General","Speech","N/A","56","2019-06"
"2019-06-04","But what if the central bank promised credibly that it would deliberately make up for any lost inflation by stimulating the economy and temporarily pushing inflation modestly above the target?","General","Speech","N/A","30","2019-06"
"2019-06-04","In the models, the prospect of future stimulus promotes anticipatory consumption and investment that could greatly reduce the pain of being at the ELB.9Policymakers discussed this reasoning in the wake of the crisis, but neither the Fed nor any other major central bank chose to pursue such a policy.10Why?","General","Speech","N/A","49","2019-06"
"2019-06-04","For makeup strategies to work, households and businesses must go out on a limb, so to speak, raising spending in the midst of a downturn.","General","Speech","N/A","25","2019-06"
"2019-06-04","In theory, they would do this based on their confidence that the central bank will deliver the makeup stimulus at some point—perhaps years in the future.","General","Speech","N/A","26","2019-06"
"2019-06-04","Despite the flattering nature of this assumption, crisis-era policymakers had major questions about whether their promise of good times to come would really have moved the hearts, minds, and pocketbooks of the public.","General","Speech","N/A","33","2019-06"

"2019-06-19","Good afternoon, and welcome. My colleagues and I have one overarching goal: to sustain the economic expansion, with a strong job market and stable prices, for the benefit of the American people. At the FOMC meeting that concluded today, we maintained our policy interest rate but made some significant changes to our statement. Since the beginning of the year, we have judged that our current policy stance was broadly appropriate and that we should be patient in assessing the need for any changes. In light of increased uncertainties and muted inflation pressures, we now emphasize that the Committee will closely monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook and will act as appropriate to sustain the expansion with a strong labor market and inflation near its 2 percent objective. I’d like to step back and review how the changing economic and financial picture brings us to today’s decision. So far this year, the economy has performed reasonably well, with solid fundamentals supporting continued growth and strong employment. Inflation has been running somewhat below our objective, but we have expected it to pick up, supported by solid growth and a strong job market. Along with this favorable picture, we have been mindful of some ongoing crosscurrents, including trade developments and concerns about global growth. At the time of our last FOMC meeting, which ended on May 1, there was tentative evidence that these crosscurrents were moderating. The latest data from China and Europe were encouraging, and there were reports of progress in trade negotiations with China. Our continued patient stance seemed appropriate, and the Committee saw no strong case for adjusting our policy rate. In the weeks since our last meeting, the crosscurrents have reemerged. Growth indicators from around the world have disappointed, on net, raising concerns about the strength of the may have contributed to the drop in business confidence in some recent surveys and may be starting to show through to incoming data. Risk sentiment in financial markets has deteriorated as well. Against this backdrop, inflation remains muted. While the baseline outlook remains favorable, the question is whether these uncertainties will continue to weigh on the outlook and thus call for additional monetary policy accommodation. Many FOMC participants now see that the case for a somewhat more accommodative policy has strengthened. Let me explain the basis for this judgment, starting with the outlook for jobs and growth. Participants see unemployment remaining low this year and next. Monthly job gains in May were lower than expected, however, and, in light of recent developments, this bears watching. Still, many labor market indicators remain strong. Community, business, and labor leaders all tell us that the prospects for job seekers have seldom been better, and that this is true even for those who have traditionally struggled to find work. Wages are rising, and this is particularly so for lower-paying jobs. Committee participants’ growth projections from 2019 are little revised from March, with a central tendency of 2 percent to 2.2 percent, just above their estimates of longer-run normal growth. The growth projections for the year as a whole mask some important details about the composition of growth. Annual growth will be boosted by the surprisingly strong first quarter, which had just been reported at the time of the May FOMC meeting. As I noted then, the unexpected strength was largely in net exports and inventories—components that are not generally reliable indicators of ongoing momentum. The more reliable drivers of growth in the pace. In contrast, the limited evidence available at this time suggests that growth in business fixed income has slowed in the second quarter.1 Moreover, manufacturing production has posted declines so far this year. Thus, while the baseline outlook remains favorable, many FOMC participants cited the investment picture and weaker business sentiment and the crosscurrents I mentioned earlier as supporting their judgment that the risk of less favorable outcomes has risen. After running close to our symmetric 2 percent objective for most of last year, inflation declined in the first quarter. Data since then show some pickup. Participants broadly see inflation moving back up toward our 2 percent objective, but at a slower pace than had been expected. The central tendency for 2019 core inflation, which omits volatile food and energy components, is between 1.7 and 1.8 percent. Setting aside short-term fluctuations, Committee participants expressed concerns about the pace of inflation’s return to 2 percent. Wages are rising, as noted above, but not at a pace that would provide much upward impetus to inflation. Moreover, weaker global growth may continue to hold inflation down around the world. We are firmly committed to our symmetric 2 percent inflation objective, and we are well aware that inflation weakness that persists even in a healthy economy could precipitate a difficult-to-arrest downward drift in longer-run inflation expectations. Because there are no definitive measures of inflation expectations, we must rely on imperfect proxies. Market-based measures of inflation compensation have moved down since our May meeting, and some survey- based expectations measures are near the bottom of their historic ranges. Combining these 1 Chair Powell intended to say that growth in business fixed investment slowed in the second quarter. Overall, our policy discussions focused on the appropriate response to the uncertain environment. The projections of appropriate policy show that many participants believe that some cut in the federal funds rate will be appropriate in the scenario that they see as most likely. Though some participants wrote down policy cuts and others did not, our deliberations made clear that a number of those who wrote down a flat rate path agree that the case for additional accommodation has strengthened since our May meeting. This added accommodation would support economic activity and inflation’s return to our objective. Uncertainties surrounding the baseline outlook have clearly risen since our last meeting. It is important, however, that monetary policy not overreact to any individual data point or short- term swing in sentiment. Doing so would risk adding even more uncertainty to the outlook. Thus, my colleagues and I will be looking to see whether these uncertainties will continue to weigh on the outlook, and we will use our tools as appropriate to sustain the expansion. Thank you. I will be pleased to take your questions. So the Committee had, you know, our usual long discussion of global and domestic economic and financial conditions and then spent this morning talking about monetary policy. And I came to the view that I expressed to you, which is that we’re going to be monitoring—monitoring the crosscurrents and the other items that we’ve mentioned, but that So, generally, as I mentioned, many on the Committee do see a strengthened case—eight of those, a strengthened case for cutting rates. Eight actually wrote down rate cuts. A number of others see that the case has strengthened. But the Committee wanted to see more, as I mentioned. And I also mentioned that some of these—some of these developments have been of quite recent vintage. And so we do expect that we’ll be learning a lot more on all of these issues in the near term. And that’s our focus. I’m sure that things will change before the next meeting. I expect a full range of data and information on all of these issues that we are looking at. I think we’ll learn a great deal more about them. And I think that’s—we think that that’s the right way to move here. Again, many of these developments happened, you know, part of the way through the last intermeeting period. Only seven weeks ago, we had a great jobs report and came out of the last FOMC meeting feeling that the economy, and our policy, was in a good place. So we want to see—we want to see and we want to react to developments and trends that are sustained, that are genuine, and not react just to data points or just to changes in sentiment, which can be volatile. At the same time, we are—we’re quite mindful of the risks to the outlook and are prepared to move and use our tools as needed to sustain the expansion. I think the law is clear that I have a four-year term, and I fully intend to serve it. Right. So we’re always trying to balance that risk, but I would say that, given the quite recent nature of some of the events, I think the Committee felt, though, that the right thing to do was to wait and see more. And we will see a lot more on all of these issues in the very near term. So I don’t think the risk of waiting too long is prominent right now. I would say, as a general matter, it’s always something that we have to weigh. But I think we believe that the right thing here is to watch carefully in the near term and see how these risks unfold and see whether they continue to weigh on the outlook. Obviously, we try to avoid going prematurely as well. In this case, you know, there’s always some judgment in these things. But I would just say that the risks that we see having emerged are risks that have gotten our attention and that have called a number of us to write down rate cuts, and a number of those who haven’t to see that the case has strengthened. Let me let me say the same thing as I said the last time, before there had been any dissents, and that is that I think the process of careful, thoughtful dissent is a very healthy one, and I’ve always believed that. And I feel like you make better decisions when you Well, first, I think all central banks are focused on their domestic— their mandates are domestic, and they’re focused on economic conditions from a domestic standpoint. And that goes for the European Central Bank, it goes for the Fed, it goes for all central banks. So that’s our principal focus. So it could cut either way. You know, I would think that, to the extent you see stronger financial conditions and stronger activity in the ECB after a rate cut, that would support—tend to support activity.3 So we’re really focused on, you know, the risks to our—on the baseline outlook, which is still a pretty favorable one, and the risks to those outlooks. That’s our principal focus. That’s the inflation question. I’m saying you— I see. Okay, right. Okay. So let me let me answer the inflation question first. So we’re saying that we know—I noted in the statement and also in my—what I said here. We saw that market-based measures of inflation expectations, breakevens, dropped. We noted that also in the statement. And I noted it as a reason for us to—one of several reasons why it feels to us that the case for more accommodation has strengthened. So we find that notable. Not only that, the actual forecast for inflation for this year, among FOMC participants, dropped a couple of tenths. So that means a more prolonged shortfall of inflation. Let me say, on inflation, it’s something I’ve been concerned about for quite a long time. It’s one of the principal reasons why I called for the review. In a world where policy rates are going to be closer to the effective lower bound, then, just as a general matter, we need to be really strong on 2 percent inflation. So I think, you know, we certainly don’t want to be seen as weak on inflation, and I don't believe we are. working our way through it. And I think it’s just something we do. You know that my view on the dots is that they, overall, provide useful information for people, but that we need to do our absolute best to explain what they are and what they are not. Speaking of which, they are not a forecast of the group, they’re not discussed or debated at the meeting, they’re an input to policy more than an output of policy, and they’re also only the most likely case. So, in a situation where there’s relatively high uncertainty, there’s the most likely case, but the second most likely case might only be a little bit less likely. But that doesn’t show up in the dot. The dot is either one thing or it’s another. So I just would say that, if you pay too close attention to the dots, then you may lose sight of the larger picture. On the specific question of that, that’s just something we haven’t really engaged with yet, and it will depend very heavily on incoming data and the evolving risk More generally, though, the research you refer to essentially notes that, in a world where you are closer to the effective lower bound, it’s why—research kind of shows this—it’s wise to react, for example, to prevent a weakening from turning into a prolonged weakening. In other words, sort of, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. So I think that is a valid way to think about policy in this era. I don’t know—and it’s always in the—I think it’s in the minds of policymakers, you know, during this era, because it’s well understood to be correct. Again, I don’t know what that means in terms of the size of a particular rate cut going forward. That’s going to depend heavily upon, you know, the actual data and the evolving risk picture. So, why not now? And, I would say, there was not much support for cutting rates now at this meeting. There was, as you see, a number of people wrote down rate cuts. But all of those, but apparently one, felt that it would be better to see more to—before moving. And I gave a couple of reasons why that is the case. First, it’s just the fact that some of these developments are so recent that we want to see whether they’ll sustain. So we felt that it would be better to get a clearer picture of things, and that we would, in fact, learn a lot about these developments in the near term. Ultimately, the question we’re going to be asking ourselves is, are these risks going to be continuing to weigh on the outlook? And we will act as needed, including promptly, if that’s appropriate, and use our tools to expand—to sustain the expansion. Well, you gave a pretty good picture. I mean, it’s a complicated picture, and, you know, the answer is, we look at all of it. But I would say, the big pieces of it are this: The baseline outlook has been a good one, and that has basically been consumer spending coming back up in the second quarter. That is coming true. And consumer spending is at a healthy level, and that makes sense. You’ve got a tight labor market. You’ve got companies in surveys saying that labor is scarce. You’ve got workers in surveys saying that jobs are plentiful. You’ve got wages going up. You’ve got high levels of household confidence. So, all of that, underlying fundamentals for the consumer spending part of the economy, which is 70 percent of the economy, is quite solid. Job creation, if you take a three-month average, is still well above, you know, the entry—level of entry into the workforce. So that part of the economy is solid. You mentioned manufacturing, and we’re seeing this all around the world. Manufacturing, investment, and trade have been weaker. It’s not solely a domestic issue, and it may be that there are a range of factors that are contributing to that, including, for example, what China has done over the last couple of years in working to bring down its leverage. Some of it may be uncertainty over your supply chains due to trade developments. The Boeing 737 issues may be contributing in their own way. So there—lower oil prices are contributing to lower investment, although they’re also leading to lower gas prices, which supports spending. So there are many, many things. There isn’t any one thing that explains it all. But it’s something that low unemployment, good job creation, rising wages, that’s kind of the two big pieces of it that you see. Then you see the crosscurrents. If you lay the crosscurrents on top of that—concerns about global growth and trade developments—you have the full picture. And I think what that picture—what we took away from that picture is that we’d like to see more, that we do see these risks, and what we want to do is, we want to watch and see whether they continue to weigh upon the outlook. Well, we have the tools we have, and we’re committed and sworn to use them to support economic activity. And they do support economic activity through a number of channels that are reasonably well understood—some more directly tied to interest rates than others. But we do generally believe that—that our interest rate policy can support demand and support business investment as well. And so we will use those tools and use them as we see as appropriate to achieve our objectives, which really are to sustain this expansion, and I would just make a note of that. The reason why we say “sustain the expansion” is, you’re seeing now, for the first time, you know, communities that are being brought into the benefits of this expansion that hadn’t reasons why we think it’s so important to sustain the expansion, keep it going, because we really are benefiting groups that haven’t seen, you know, this kind of prosperity in a long time. So we take the—you know, we take the crosscurrents as a given, and we have our tools. You know, we don’t—we react to anything in principle that could undermine our achievement of our dual-mandate goals—maximum employment, stable prices—is worthy of our attention and can call forth a policy response. And that’s just how we look at it. You know, I don’t—I don’t discuss elected officials publicly or privately, really. So I would just say that we are—at the Fed, we’re deeply committed to carrying out our mission, and also that our independence from direct political control we see as an important institutional feature that has served both the economy and the country well. So, on your specific question of digital currencies replacing central bank currencies, I think we’re a long way from that. And, of course, the—so I think we’re a long way from that. Digital currencies are in their infancy. So, essentially, not too concerned about, you know, the central banks no longer being able to carry out monetary policy because of cryptocurrencies or digital currencies. You know, Facebook, I believe, has made quite broad rounds in—around the world really with regulators, supervisors, and lots of people to discuss their plans, and that certainly includes us. And we’re—you know, it’s something we’re looking at. We meet with a broad range of private-sector firms all the time on financial technology, and there’s just a tremendous amount of innovation going on out there. You know, there are potential benefits here. There are also potential risks, particularly of a currency that could, you know, that could potentially have large application. So I would echo what Governor Carney said, which is that we will wind up having quite high expectations, from a sort of safety and soundness and regulatory standpoint, if they do decide to go forward with something. You know, we have—we don’t have plenary authority over cryptocurrencies as such. They play into our world through consumer protection and money laundering and things like that. But, I would say that, you know, through international forums, you know, we have significant input into the payment system and, as you know, play an important role in the payment system here in the United States. interesting, I think, is developing, is that outside experts are excited and are—like the idea of the Fed shifting your inflation target up to 4 percent—around there, roughly, I guess. They think that that would, you know, help monetary policy, and that there’s no—2 percent is not, like, sanctimonious or anything, or whatever, sacred. It seems that you’ve taken that off the table. So I was wondering if you could discuss that. Have you taken it off the table? And then, if so, why, or—and what’s your thoughts on that? Thank you. We have—we’ve said that we wouldn’t look at raising the target rate for inflation. We did say that. And the reason is, it’s become a global norm, 2 percent. Our statutory mandate is price stability. And so we’re actually taking a less—we’re looking at less radical ideas, such as how to make the 2 percent inflation objective more credible. This gives me a chance to say a couple things about the review and Chicago, in particular. So it’s a new thing for us. It’s something that—I thought it was both appropriate and important for us to do. It’ll be a yearlong, or even longer, process, looking at our strategy, tools, and communications. And it’s meant to be a way to open ourselves up, to let the sunshine in, and have dialogue and criticism with the constituencies that we serve. We’ve had a series of Fed Listens around the country at every Reserve Bank, and we had an academic conference earlier this month, with seven papers written and criticized, and leading global experts. But I’ll just say, again, that the heart of the conference was the two panels on—with practitioners in low and moderate income—who live in low- and moderate-income communities and are part of those communities. And they were—there, I think, people were quite struck by their intervention, which was really uniformly around how important maximum employment is have had is low unemployment, lots of social problems. And just now, you have, you know, companies who want to hire and are bringing people into the—providing opportunities for people to come into the labor force to an extent not seen in quite a long time. And that is, I think, you know, for someone who does this work, that was very focusing and motivating, too. So I think everybody thought, you know, that’s—that was really quite worth doing. I mean, there was some thought at the beginning that we should—some people recommended that we just talk to, you know, econ Ph.D.’s about this, but, no, that’s not what we chose to do, and we’re glad this is the choice we made. I don’t think it’s—I don’t think it’s a practical alternative. And I’ll tell you why. I think you see disinflationary pressures around the world. You see central banks having a hard time getting inflation up to their—close to their objective. We’ve done better than other large central banks that are not, you know, open economies, like the So the 2013 guidance is not binding, and that’s what came out of the GAO review. But that’s really the beginning of this—of the story. You know, we have the authority we need to examine the banks for safety and soundness exposure. So, this—the first thing you start with as a bank supervisor is the risks that the banks are taking to themselves through their portfolio, through the risks that they’re running and the pipeline—you know, the obligations that they’ve undertaken to underwrite deals. And so we monitor that very carefully—so do the banks—and you see exposures that are much smaller than they were before the crisis. And, by the way, we test that regularly in the stress tests. We impose very large losses on those portfolios, so we kind of have a sense of what that is, whereas before the crisis, there was a lot of lack of knowledge about what the losses would be. So that’s where it starts for us in supervision, is the risks that the banks are running—you know, running on their own books and to themselves and to each other. So, in that, I feel—I feel like that is—that’s in a good place, but we never—we never say “Mission accomplished” on that. We will keep—you know, keep monitoring that carefully. know, we have a good sense of, domestically, of where that paper is. I think, internationally, not as much, and the Financial Stability Board is actually looking more carefully at that. And we— you know, we monitor those vehicles to see what they are. And they’re actually pretty stably funded, in the sense that there’s no run risk, but there’s still macroeconomic risk. And, you know, this is something that we take very seriously and that the FSOC, the Financial Stability Oversight Council, is looking at. And, you know, we call it out as a macroeconomic risk, but it’s not really a financial stability risk, in the sense that it could undermine the ability of the financial system to do its job of intermediating credit. You know, I think the issue isn’t that the banks don’t understand what the rules are. The issue is that the risk isn’t in the banks. It’s in—it’s out in those market-based vehicles. So I don’t, I don’t—you know, I no longer am day-to-day involved in this as I was before I took this job. But my sense is, though, that that’s really not the problem. I’m not saying it’s perfect, but I think we do understand what risks the banks are running. And really the question is, how concerned should we be about large holdings by market-based vehicles that I mentioned, and what risks do they present? And we’re very carefully assessing that. And we You know, we have to be closer, because more jobs are being created than people are entering the labor force. The unemployment rate is lower. You know, by just lots and lots of numbers, the labor market is in a good place. You mentioned wages. So the level of wages is very consistent with what it should be, in the sense that it’s approximately equal to inflation plus productivity increases on an hourly basis. So what’s, I guess, a little surprising, though, is that you could reach these levels of unemployment late—you know, long into a cycle, let’s say, and not see even higher wages that are pushing up on inflation, because wages at this level, even though they’re growing at a healthy rate, at an appropriate rate, they’re not growing at a rate that would provide much upward thrust for inflation. So, you know, we watch—we watch all of this very carefully, and I think we’re very careful about not assuming that we’re, you know, that would—that there’s no more slack in the labor market. You know, we’ve all lived through—you know, when I got to the Fed, we were in the 8 percent–plus range, and it’s just gone down and down and down, and you haven’t seen wages picked up. You haven’t seen real signals that we’re at maximum employment. You have So, of course, we haven’t made any decisions yet. Balance sheet runoff is very close to the end of its planned life. I would say this: If we do provide more accommodation—again, we haven’t really addressed this—but if we do provide more accommodation, we’ll certainly keep in mind what we said earlier this year, which is that we’ll always be willing to adjust balance sheet policy so that it serves our dual-mandate objectives. Thank you very much.","Full Text","Press Conf","","4576","2019-06"

"2019-07-09","What was urgently needed was a way to restore confidence in the financial system—a daunting challenge.","General","Speech","N/A","16","2019-07"
"2019-07-09","Neither the banks, nor the regulators, nor the public had a reliable sense of the strength and resilience of our major banks.","General","Speech","N/A","22","2019-07"
"2019-07-09","The announcement of forward-looking stress-testing results in May 2009 helped restore confidence and stabilize banks by providing a credible and independent picture of their finances.1These original stress tests evolved into the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review, or CCAR, program, which has served to institutionalize capital planning by firms, and supervision by the Fed, as a forward-looking endeavor.","General","Speech","N/A","57","2019-07"
"2019-07-09","But if stress tests are to continue to serve their critical function, they will need to evolve in the years ahead to keep pace with the ever-changing financial system, as they have since the first round of tests in 2009.","General","Speech","N/A","40","2019-07"

"2019-07-16","It is true that many of these features have been with us for some time.","General","Speech","N/A","15","2019-07"
"2019-07-16","Such changes in the macroeconomic environment are significant because the long-run normal levels of inflation, output, interest rates, and the unemployment rate are important structural features by which we guide policy.","General","Speech","N/A","31","2019-07"

"2019-07-16","Standard estimates of the natural rate of unemployment—u*—and the neutral rate of interest—r*—have been declining for 2 decades, and particularly since the crisis.","General","Speech","N/A","23","2019-07"

There’s a range of views on the Committee, and—but the Committee is unified, completely unified on our dedication to making the best policy decisions that we can make. And that means people have a responsibility to do their best thinking and to present that thinking, and I wouldn’t have it any other way. to be following going forward.

"2019-07-31","Yes. So we, as we noted—we noted at the bottom of the statement that language, which really says how we’re thinking about it. So it says, as we’re contemplating the future path of the target range for the federal funds rate, we’ll continue to monitor the implications of incoming information—and it talks about that language. So, you know, I can’t— all I can tell you is, we’ll be looking at weak global growth. We’ll be looking very carefully to see how that’s happening. And I think you see—you learn—every cycle you learn about these things. So we will see whether growth is picking up, whether it’s bottoming out. We’ll see that picture. We’ll also see on trade. You know, we’re going to be seeing—I think we’ve learned a lot on trade in this be more precise, but with trade, it is a factor that we have to assess in kind of a new way. Those are the things that we’ll be looking at, and—you know, in making our decisions going forward.","Q&A","Press Conf","","171","2019-07"
"2019-07-31","Yes. So we don’t hear that from businesses. They don’t come in and say, “We’re not investing because, you know, the federal funds rate is too high.” I haven’t heard that from a business. What you hear is that demand is weak for their products. You see manufacturing being weak all over the world. Investment—business investment is weak. And I wouldn’t lay all of that at the door of trade talks. I think there’s a—there’s a global business cycle happening with manufacturing and investment, and that’s—that’s been, you know, definitely a bigger factor than, certainly, we expected late last year. I think global—global growth started to slow down in the middle of last year, but that has gone on to a greater extent. And, by the way, trade policy uncertainty has also been, I think, more elevated than we anticipated. In terms of, is this the—we believe this is the right move for today, and we think it’s—we think it will serve the three ends that I mentioned. And I’ve already gone over how we’re thinking about going forward. with this move today about future rate moves?","Q&A","Press Conf","","187","2019-07"
"2019-07-31","Well, the sense of that is—I mean, that refers back to other times when the FOMC has cut rates in the middle of a cycle. And I’m contrasting it there with the beginning—for example, the beginning of a lengthy cutting cycle.","Q&A","Press Conf","","41","2019-07"
"2019-07-31","That is not—that’s not what we’re seeing now. That’s not our perspective now or outlook.","Q&A","Press Conf","","15","2019-07"
"2019-07-31","Okay. So, on the first, I would say that I view the level of capital requirements and the level of capital in the system as being about right. I do agree with that. The idea that you’re talking about is one that’s—that Vice Chair Quarles has talked about. It’s a—it’s one under consideration. The idea being, in a sense, we’ve chosen, in the United States, to have high through-the-cycle capital requirements by doubling the SIFI surcharge, which is the surcharge that the largest banks have in their capital requirements. We’ve, in effect, already put in place substantial countercyclical buffers. And so, conceptually, you can think of—I’m not saying it’s the same thing as a countercyclical capital buffer. So that’s—that’s really the point—is that we don’t rely—our system doesn’t rely on our ability—it doesn’t mainly rely on our ability to identify the right time in the cycle to trigger a countercyclical tool. We rely on through-the-cycle, always-on high capital and liquidity requirements. And I think that’s a good thing to do. The idea of putting it in place so you can cut it, that’s something some other jurisdictions have done, and it’s worth considering. I think the United Kingdom, in particular, has a countercyclical capital buffer that’s always on, but the one point of it is that you can cut when there’s a downturn and therefore give the banks more room. So this isn’t something we’ve decided to do. It’s just under consideration. In terms of the real-time payment system, your second question, so this is something we—the United States is far behind other countries in terms of having real-time payments available to the general public. The Fed, really, coming out of the Reserve System—the Reserve Banks and the Board together—convened all of the stakeholders around the table to talk about several years. And one of the things that came out of that was a recommendation that the Fed should build a 24 x 7 x 365 real-time settlement system to solve that problem—to address that problem. We put out a proposal in October of last year about, you know, should we do this, and we got quite a lot of comments. They were overwhelmingly favorable. And I would point out that in our payment system, in many places, the Fed operates alongside private-sector operators—for example, in wholesale payments, in ACH, and in check—so it wouldn’t be unusual or out of keeping with—with how we’ve done things in the past. We have not made a decision on this, but it’s something we’re looking at carefully and something I do expect we’ll make a decision on soon.","Q&A","Press Conf","","435","2019-07"
"2019-07-31","So it is—as I mentioned, it’s going to depend on the evolving data and the evolving risk picture. But as we look at the situation now and the outlook now, what we see is that it’s appropriate to make an adjustment in policy to a somewhat more accommodative the","Q&A","Press Conf","","49","2019-07"
"2019-07-31","Well, I think the best thing for people who are—who are feeling that—and we are getting lots of feedback from people who work and live in low- and moderate- income communities to the effect that they’re now feeling the recovery, and, in fact, they haven’t felt a better labor market in anybody’s memory, so this is great to hear. And I guess my view is, the best thing we can do for those people is to sustain the expansion, keep it going, and that’s one of the overarching goals of—of this move and all of our policy moves. There really is no reason why the expansion can’t keep going. Inflation is not troublingly high. If you look at the—at the","Q&A","Press Conf","","120","2019-07"
"2019-07-31","So I gave my—my reasons for—our reasons, really—for doing this. And, you know, just to touch on that again, this action is designed to insure against downside risks to the outlook from weak global growth and trade tensions, offset the negative effect that those factors are already having, and promote a faster return of inflation to 2 percent. That’s what we’ve been talking about all year long, and we’ve gradually moved our policy in the direction of more accommodation. I think what you see is an economy that has reacted well to that. So that’s what we’re doing, and that’s why we’re doing it. We never take into account political considerations. There’s no place in our discussions for that. We also don’t conduct monetary policy in order to prove our independence. We conduct monetary policy in order to—to move as close as possible to our statutory goals, and that’s what we’re always going to do. We’re always going to use our tools that way. And then, at the end, we’ll—you know, we’ll live with the results. In terms of the balance sheet, that was really just a matter of simplicity and consistency. Really nothing more to it than that.","Q&A","Press Conf","","199","2019-07"
"2019-07-31","Yes. So, first, let me say—I’ll just speak for myself, but I understand those concerns very well. I do. I’ve—you know, I’ve studied them, I’ve spoken about them, and I take them very seriously. But as I look at today’s situation, I don’t see them as a reason not to take this action today. I just don’t think—that would be my point. And one of the reasons why I think that is, if you look—if you look—so we have a financial stability framework now for the first time. Before the crisis, we didn’t have this, but now we have it, and we publish it. And we look at, really, four big things so that we know we can—you know, the public can hold us accountable and compare us meeting to meeting, and—you know, and see whether we got this right, because it’s transparent now. But the four things we look at are valuation pressures. And we do see notable valuation pressures in some markets but, you know, honestly, not at a highly troubling level. In terms of household borrowing, household and business borrowing is the second thing. Households are in a very good shape overall. I’ll come back to business borrowing. Leverage in the financial system is low, and funding risk is low. So, overall, staff’s view has been—and my view has been—that if you look overall, financial stability vulnerabilities are moderate. The place that gets all the attention right now—a lot of attention—is business borrowing, and we look very carefully at that. What’s happening with business borrowing is, the loans have moved off the balance sheets of the banks and into market-based vehicles, which tend to be stably funded. But, nonetheless, it’s clear that the highly leveraged business sector could act as an amplifier to a downturn. So we’re watching that very carefully. But, again, I think if you gives us the ability to use monetary policy for its purposes and rely on supervisory and regulatory tools to—you know, to keep the financial system resilient.","Q&A","Press Conf","","336","2019-07"
"2019-07-31","There are very few things that I don’t worry about at all. So, of course, of course, we monitor. We have—every quarter we have an extensive briefing on financial stability, and we had that yesterday. So we look at this on an ongoing basis. We have a great team. We liaise with central banks around the world. You know, one of my colleagues is the head of the Financial Stability Board globally, so we’re very, very much monitoring these things all the time. And we worry about them all the time. We’re always looking at the—we’re looking for that thing that we may have missed a lot of the time. But the things we haven’t missed, I think they paint a mixed picture, but not one that should prevent us from taking monetary policy actions that we think are appropriate to support the economy.","Q&A","Press Conf","","144","2019-07"
"2019-07-31","No. Let me be clear. What I said was, it’s not—it’s not the beginning of a long series of rate cuts. I didn’t—I didn’t say it’s just one or anything like that. What I said is, when you think about rate-cutting cycles, they go on for a long time, and the what we’re seeing. That’s not what we’re seeing. What we’re seeing is that it’s appropriate to—to adjust policy to a somewhat more accommodative stance over time, and that’s how we’re looking at it. What I said was, it’s not a long cutting cycle—in other words, referring to what we do when there’s a recession or a very severe downturn. That’s—that’s really what I was ruling out. I think, if you look back at other midcycle adjustments, you’ll see—you know, I don’t know that they’ll be, in the end, comparable or not, but you’ll see examples of these.","Q&A","Press Conf","","148","2019-07"
"2019-07-31","So, you know, I wouldn’t bring it down to any one trade thing or any one factor. I think we look at a broad range of factors, and trade uncertainty—trade policy uncertainty is one of them. That certainly includes the discussions with China, but I wouldn’t—I wouldn’t be able to tell you how much of it is due to that. And without knowing—you know, I think we—with trade, we have to react to the developments, and we don’t know what they’ll be, and so it’s hard to exactly say. Certainly, we’ve seen, though, that when there’s a sharp confrontation between two large economies, you can see effects on business confidence pretty quickly and on financial markets pretty quickly. We saw that in June. But then we saw them unwind after that, to some extent. You’ve seen it returning to—to a much lower temperature,","Q&A","Press Conf","","143","2019-07"

"2019-07-31","So the problems at Wells Fargo—that arose at Wells Fargo around risk management and consumer—the way they dealt with the consumer were actually pretty deep, and I think the company realizes that. And they’re not going to be fixed—they haven’t been fixed quickly, and, frankly, we didn’t expect them to be fixed quickly. So they’re—you know, they—they will be under the growth cap, our enforcement action, until the Board votes to lift it, and that’s not something we’re considering doing right now. And the Committee—I mean, the company is working away to address these issues, but, as I said, they’re deep-seated issues, and it just takes time to address them. I wouldn’t comment on the CEO question. I don’t really have anything for you on that.","Q&A","Press Conf","","126","2019-07"
"2019-07-31","You know, the premise is not—I will question your premise for a second. If you remember whether—again, one of the purposes of our—of our cut today is to support the expansion. And we don’t know when—and if it really works—if that works very well and the economy gets going again, you know, you don’t know where the—where the funds, in other cycles—and I don’t know whether this will happen or not, but in other cycles, the Fed wound up raising rates again after a midcycle adjustment. Again, I’m not predicting that, but I don’t think that we know that we won’t have—that we’ll have less ammo because of these things. That’s one thing. So—","Q&A","Press Conf","","114","2019-07"
"2019-07-31","Well, but you’re assuming that we would never raise rates again, that once we’ve cut these rates that they can never go back up again. Just as a matter of principle, I don’t think that’s right. In other—in other long, long cycles, long","Q&A","Press Conf","","43","2019-07"
"2019-07-31","So the monetary policy review is really for—it’s really there to look at the way we make policy in the longer run. It’s not something that enters directly into our discussions today. We’ve had—so far we’ve had a series of meetings, called Fed Listens, at almost all the Reserve Banks. Soon it will be all the Reserve Banks. And we meet there with the constituencies that we serve, and they’ve been very, very successful, hearing from people—not just—not just economists, but people who are not economists, how—how their lives interact with the Fed’s work. It’s been—it’s been great. I’ve got to say, it’s been even better than I hoped it would be. We’re just now beginning the process of incorporating all of that feedback, and we’re going to be having a series of meetings, beginning today and yesterday, as we evaluate, you know, the questions that we’re asking about our framework. So it’s very early to say where that’s going, but, you know, we’re setting the table now and looking at what our framework is I’m very excited about it. I think it’s been a good exercise. I think it’s opened us up to sunlight and perspectives that we might not have gotten otherwise. And I think it’s a good time. You know, you have—10 years after the crisis, you’re really living in a new normal for the economy and monetary policy, and it’s a really good time to step back and ask whether there are some things that we can do to improve our framework.","Q&A","Press Conf","","256","2019-07"
"2019-07-31","So I think this was—this was well telegraphed. What we did today was—was very consistent with what we had said we were going to do. I had mentioned the reasons for it. They’ve been well telegraphed, and I think—you know, I think they will—they will achieve their goals. We do know that monetary policy works through communications and then actions that are consistent with those communications, and we think that the changes that we’ve made this year have really worked. Of course, we always retain the flexibility to adjust our communications and our actions to—in light of incoming data and the evolving risk picture, but—I’ll leave it there.","Q&A","Press Conf","","108","2019-07"

You mentioned lower r*, trade slowdown— and I would actually add, lower natural rate of unemployment too has moved down, all of which Committee moving away from rate increases to a neutral posture to, now, a rate cut. So I think we’ve been providing—and that affects the forward rate path, and it affects financial conditions, and financial conditions affect the economy. You see an economy which is actually performing pretty well. Growth in the first half of this year is about the same as it was in all of ’18 and actually a little better than our forecast for growth in 2019—at the end of 2019. So I think, in a way, that’s monetary policy working. And, again, I wouldn’t just look at the 25 basis point cut as the right question.","Q&A","Press Conf","","148","2019-07"

Since—you know, since we noted our vigilance about the situation in June, you saw financial conditions move up, and you saw—I won’t take credit for the whole recovery, but you saw financial conditions move up.

"2019-07-31","So I think you have to look at not just the 25 basis point cut, but look at the Committee’s actions over the course of the year. As I noted in my opening statement, we started off expecting some rate increases, we moved to a patient setting for a few months, and now we’ve moved here. I think what you’ve seen over the course of the year is, as we’ve moved to a more accommodative policy, the economy has actually performed just about as expected with that gradually increasing support. And I think—I wouldn’t take credit for all of that, but I do think that increasing policy support has kept the economy on track and kept the outlook favorable. In terms of the rest of your question, the Committee is really thinking of this as a way of adjusting policy to a somewhat more accommodative stance to further the three objectives that I mentioned: to insure against downside risks, to provide support to the economy, that those factors are—where factors are pushing down on economic growth, and then to support inflation. So we do think it will serve all of those goals, but again, we’re thinking of it as essentially in the nature of a midcycle adjustment to policy.","Q&A","Press Conf","","209","2019-07"
"2019-07-31","So, you’re absolutely right. The—the performance of the economy has been reasonably good. The position of the economy is as close to our objectives as it’s been that everywhere: weak manufacturing, weak global growth now, particularly in the European Union and China. In addition, we see trade policy developments, which at times have been disruptive and then have been less so, and also inflation running below target. So we see those as threats to what is clearly a favorable outlook, and we see this action as designed to support them and keep that outlook favorable. And, frankly, it is a continuation of what we’ve been doing all year to provide more support against those very same risks.","Q&A","Press Conf","","117","2019-07"

"2019-09-18","You know, so, I think—and my colleagues and I, I think, all think that the most likely case is for continued moderate growth, continued strong labor market, and inflation moving back up to 2 percent. And I think that’s, by the way, widely shared among forecasters. You know, the issue is more the risks to that. You have downside risks here, and we’ve talked about them. It’s that global growth will have an effect on","Q&A","Press Conf","","75","2019-09"
"2019-09-18","Right. So what we are looking for through all of the data, all the events that are going on around the world, we’ll be looking at, you know, the evolving geopolitical events, we’ll be looking at global growth, we’ll be looking at trade policy uncertainty. Most importantly, we’ll be looking at the performance of the","Q&A","Press Conf","","55","2019-09"
"2019-09-18","It’s very hard to say. It’s—you know, it’s tough to say. We’ll— we’ll use our tools to offset negative—that’s really the job of monetary policy, is, to the extent it can, to offset, you know, things that drive us away from maximum employment and stable prices.","Q&A","Press Conf","","46","2019-09"
"2019-09-18","So, in terms of how our rate cuts will affect the real economy, first, we think monetary policy works with, as Friedman said, long and variable lags. So I think the real effects will be felt over time. But, you know, we think that lower interest rates will reduce interest burden for borrowers, so that interest-sensitive things like housing and durable goods and other things like that—cars—it supports purchases of those. Just, again, broadly, more accommodative financial conditions—higher asset prices. That’s—the models and the data show that that’s another powerful channel. I also think there’s a confidence channel. You see—you see household and business confidence turn up when financial conditions become more accommodative. So I think, through all of those channels, monetary policy works. It isn’t, you know, precisely the right tool for every single possible negative thing that can happen to the economy, but, nonetheless, it broadly works, and, you know, we’re going to use the tool we have. And if it comes to it, we’ll use all of our tools. So that’s how we think it works and how we think it’s working.","Q&A","Press Conf","","185","2019-09"
"2019-09-18","You know, in terms of firepower, I think the general principle, as I mentioned earlier, is, it can be a mistake to try to hold onto your firepower until a downturn gains momentum, and then—so there’s a fair amount of research that would show that that’s the case. Now, I think that principle needs to be applied carefully to the situation at hand. What we believe we’re facing here—what we think we’re facing here is a situation which can be addressed and should be addressed with moderate adjustments to the federal funds rate. As I mentioned, we are watching carefully to see whether that is the case. If, in fact, the economy weakens more, then we’re prepared to be aggressive, and we’ll do so if it turns out to be appropriate. You mentioned negative interest rates. So negative interest rates is something that we looked at during the financial crisis and chose not to do. We chose to—after we got to the effective lower bound, we chose to do a lot of aggressive forward guidance and also large-scale asset purchases, and those were the two unconventional monetary policy tools that we used extensively. We feel that they worked fairly well. We did not use negative rates. And I think if we were to find ourselves at some future date again at the effective lower bound—again, not something we are expecting—then I think we would look at using large-scale asset purchases and forward guidance. I do not think we’d be looking at using negative rates. I just don’t think those will be at the top of our list. By the way, we are in the middle of a monetary policy review where we’re looking through all of these questions about the longer-run framework—the strategy, tools, and communications—and we expect that to be completed sometime around the middle of next year. extent will it offset the negative effects of the trade uncertainty and tensions?","Q&A","Press Conf","","322","2019-09"
"2019-09-18","Well, I think, yeah. I mean, it’s a challenge. There’s no simple bottom-line answer where I can say, yes, I’ve got it for you here. But what it amounts to is this: What you see is probably the kind of volatility that’s typical of an important, complex, ongoing negotiation. And I think what we need to do is to try to look through the volatility and react to the underlying forces, the underlying things that are happening that are relevant to our mandate. We don’t—we have nothing to do with setting trade policy or negotiating trade agreements. We’re supposed to be reacting on behalf of the American economy to support maximum employment and stable prices. So we need to look through what’s a pretty volatile situation. So that means not overreacting quickly. It means not underreacting, too. So that’s really what we’re trying to do. And, you know, I would say, the outlook is positive in the face of these crosswinds we’ve felt. And so, to some extent, I do believe that our shifting to a more accommodative stance over the course of the year has been one of the reasons why the outlook has remained favorable.","Q&A","Press Conf","","197","2019-09"
"2019-09-18","So my point, really, was that—to start, that trade policy is not the business of the Fed, it’s the business of Congress and the Administration. But—so why are we talking about it? We’re talking about it because anything that affects the achievement of our goals can, in principle, be something that monetary policy should take into consideration. And our discussions and the research we have suggests that trade policy is something that’s weighing on the outlook. So I pointed out in recent remarks that the thing we can’t address, really, is what businesses would like, which is a settled roadmap for international trade. We can’t do that. We don’t have that tool. But we do have a very powerful tool which can counteract weakness, to some extent, by supporting demand through sound monetary policy. And we think our policy tools support economic activity through fairly well-understood channels: by reducing interest and also investment by businesses; and also by boosting household and business confidence. So, you know, I don’t want to be heard to say that our tools don’t have an effect. They do. But I was making the point that there is a piece of this that we really can’t address.","Q&A","Press Conf","","201","2019-09"

I think, for the foreseeable future, we’re going to be looking at, if needed, doing the sorts of things that we did the last two days—these temporary open market operations. That will be the tool that we use. And the question will be, then—as we go through quarter-end, as we learn more, you know, what really—how much of this really has to do with the level of reserves? And I think we’ll learn quite a lot in the next six weeks.","Q&A","Press Conf","","93","2019-09"
"2019-09-18","You know, well, I think, if you look at the","Q&A","Press Conf","","10","2019-09"
"2019-09-18","You know, so, if you look at—if you actually look at households, households are in very strong shape. They’re less levered. They’ve got less debt. They’ve got more income relative to their interest requirements. And they’re in very good shape—much better shape than they were in before the financial crisis. So the household sector as a sort of aggregate matter is in very good shape. That doesn’t mean that every single person in the household sector is in good shape, but, overall, it’s really not a concern. The business sector is something that, you know, we’ve talked about a lot and studied a lot, and the situation there is that the level of debt relative to GDP in the business sector is at a high level. However, so is the size of the business sector. So, actually, the business sector itself is not materially higher leveraged than it was. Nonetheless, there are a lot of highly levered companies, and that’s the kind of thing that happens during a long cycle when there aren’t downturns for, now, into our 11th year. You get—you know, you do get that kind of phenomenon in a long cycle. So that’s something we’re monitoring, and I think our view still is that that’s a real issue, but what it really represents is a potential amplifier of a macroeconomic downturn. It does not have the makings of anything that would undermine the workings of the financial system, for example, or itself create a shock that would turn the economy down. It’s more of—it’s more of an amplifier. We take it very seriously, though, and, you know, we’re monitoring it carefully. We’re actually looking—the Financial Stability Board is actually conducting a project right now to identify where these loans are held all around the world. So it’s the subject of a lot of study and work, and, you know, we’re trying to keep on top of it. sense with people that the economy is actually starting to slow now. And people are—more and more, you talk—there’s talk about recession, so you—and even the Fed thinks the downside risks are rising. So is the economy over the next year—between now and the end of next year, do you think GDP growth is going to hold steady, and the unemployment rate—could you talk about, just, how do you see the economy evolving over the next year?","Q&A","Press Conf","","397","2019-09"
"2019-09-18","You know, I’d love to be able to articulate a simple, straightforward stopping rule, but it’s really just going to be when we think we’ve done enough. And, you know, our eyes are open. We’re watching the situation. We’ve cut rates twice. We’ve moved, really, through the course of this year, as I discussed, and, you know, we see ourselves as taking actions to sustain the expansion and thereby achieve our goals. And if you look at sort of the things that are happening in the economy, I think I personally see a high value in sustaining the expansion, because we really are reaching—this positive economy is reaching communities that haven’t been reached in a long time. There would be great benefit in having that last as long as possible, that’s all. So I don’t have a specific stopping rule for you, but I think we’re watching carefully, and there will come a time, I suspect, when we think we’ve done enough, but there may also come a time when the economy worsens, and we would then have to cut more aggressively. We don’t know. We’re going to be watching things carefully. The incoming data and the evolving situation and—that’s what’s going to guide our—guide us on that path. In terms of the morale of the institution, I would say it’s very high. We’re very unified.

"2019-09-18","You know, we try to be clear about that, but, really, I think our job is to use our tools as best we can to achieve—you know, to do the jobs that Congress has assigned us, which is achieve maximum employment and stable prices. That’s our real job. In terms of giving the fiscal authorities—who, by the way, are the ones who created us— advice about how to do their job, you know, we keep that at a high level, I think. And, at a high level, yes, I would say, and I’ve said before, that it’s really fiscal policy that is more powerful and that has much more to do with—fiscal policy can do those things that will increase the longer-run growth rate of the United States by improving productivity and labor force Over the long run, we can’t really affect the growth rate of the United States. The potential growth rate of the United States is not a function of monetary policy. It’s a function of other things.

"2019-09-18","Particularly, if you look at 2020, I think the use of this is, individual participants write down their forecasts.

Global capital markets are highly integrated, and, you know, our rates—our long rates are definitely being pulled down by the very, very low rates that are abroad. And, you know, the way I would characterize it is this: that low rates abroad are a symbol—or a sign, rather, of weak global growth, expectations of low inflation, low growth, and, you know, just kind of a lack of policy space to move against or ideas about how to break out of that low equilibrium.

I will say about Wells Fargo that, you know, there were quite wide breakdowns in risk management which resulted in, you know, mistreatment of consumers that we know was quite harmful to the consumers and to the image of the institution.

"2019-09-18","You know, so I would say I doubt that anyone is closer to and has more invested in carefully following the—you know, the behavior of these markets. So, of course, we were well aware of the—you know, the tax payments and also of the settlement of the large bond purchases. And, you know, we were very much waiting for that. But we didn’t expect—the response to that was stronger than we expected. And, by the way, our sense is that it surprised market participants a lot, too. You know, people were writing about this and publishing stories about it weeks ago. It wasn’t a surprise, but it was—it was a stronger response So, as I mentioned, it doesn’t—we don’t see this as having any implications for the broader economy or for the economic outlook, nor for our ability to control rates. The strains in the money markets reflect forces that we saw coming, and they just had a bigger effect than I think most folks anticipated—strong demand for cash to purchase Treasuries and pay corporate taxes. We took appropriate actions to address those pressures, to keep the fed funds rate within the target range, and those measures were successful. If we experience another episode of pressures in money markets, we have the tools to address those pressures. We will not hesitate to use them. And since we’re talking about this, let me take a step back and say this. Earlier in the year, as you will all recall, after careful study over a period of years, actually, the Committee announced the decision to implement monetary policy in an ample-reserves regime. And we’ve been operating in that regime for a full decade. We think it works well to implement our rate decisions. The main hallmark of that regime is that we use adjustments in our administered rates—the IOER and RRP rates—to keep the fed fund rates in the target range. It’s designed specifically so that we do not expect to be conducting frequent open market operations for that purpose. So, going forward, we’re going to be very closely monitoring market developments and assessing their implications for the appropriate level of reserves, and we’re going to be assessing, you know, the question of when it will be appropriate to resume the organic growth of our balance sheet. And I’m sure we’ll be revisiting that question during this intermeeting period and certainly at our next meeting.","Q&A","Press Conf","","403","2019-09"
"2019-09-18","Yes. So I think to provide a little context, Fed economists do research all the time. It’s generally of very high quality. It’s their research. It’s not an official finding of the Federal Reserve Board or the Federal Reserve System. It’s just—and, by the way, they put it out for public review so that you can see their econometrics, so you can see all of it— their whole work is exposed to critique by the whole profession. So it’s a great tradition that we have. And, you know, what this particular piece of work did is, it went after measuring trade while I would say, directly answering your question, there’s real uncertainty around these— around these effects. It’s a $22 trillion economy. To try to isolate the effects of certain things is very challenging, but we do the best we can. So—and this piece of research found significant effects, and that’s frankly consistent with a number of other research projects that economists have undertaken. It’s also consistent with what we’ve been hearing in the Beige Book. So, I mean, I think if you take a step back from that, we do feel that trade uncertainty is having an effect. You see it in weak business investment, weak exports—hard to quantify it precisely, though.","Q&A","Press Conf","","213","2019-09"

I think applying that principle in a particular situation is where the challenge comes.

But, yes, there’s real uncertainty, and it is certainly possible that we will need to resume the organic growth of the balance sheet earlier than we thought.

"2019-09-18","So, as you can see from our policy statement and from the SEP, we see a favorable economic outlook, with continued moderate growth, a strong labor market, and inflation near our 2 percent objective. And, by the way, that view is consistent with those of many other forecasters. As you can see, FOMC participants generally think that these positive economic outcomes will be achieved with modest adjustments to the federal funds rate. At the last press conference, I pointed to two episodes in, I guess, 1995 and 1998 as examples of such an approach, which was successful in both of those instances. As our statement also highlights, though, there are risks to this positive outlook due particularly to weak global growth and trade developments. And if the economy does turn down, then a more extensive sequence of rate cuts could be appropriate. We don’t see that—it’s not what we expect—but we would certainly follow that path if it became appropriate. In other words, as we say in our statement, we will continue to monitor these developments closely, and we will act as appropriate to help ensure that the expansion remains on track.","Q&A","Press Conf","","192","2019-09"

I will tell you, the staff has not only been working tirelessly on developing these plans, working through all of these, they’ve also been tirelessly working on turning me into a true New Yorker. So I have here my statement of where my loyalties lie. [Laughter] And, by the way, President Daly, it’s really driven by my, shall we say, “lack of love” for the Dodgers, if we get to that point. the message that we have this plan that gets us to what I would call a “true ample-reserves framework” by April of next year. And I think that does require us, in some way, to say what “good” looked like. And what “good” looked like is, I think, early September or earlier than that when we didn’t see interest rates spiking all over or these signs of stress. So there’s got to be a way for us to communicate what “good” looks like here is, basically, the administered rates doing most of the work, that any open market operations would either be a standing facility or infrequent use of those, and really just have a system that is a very coherent strategy.

"2019-10-04","in addition, you will continue to offer overnight repo operations to mitigate the risk of money market pressures that could adversely affect the implementation of monetary policy. Specific amounts for the pace of outright purchases and the size and other terms of term and overnight repo operations could then be announced by the Desk and adjusted over time.” So there’s a little bit of a separation of the FOMC decision with the implementation note, and I think that may help break the link to QE. We’re going to have to just “repetitively repeat”—that seems to be the phrase of the day—that it’s not QE, and I think we can make that sale. So waiting has its costs, too. And, I mean, I was on that team until the past couple of days, and now I think I’ve persuaded myself that—but anyway, I think we can manage that. So, in the course of this meeting, I didn’t—of course, we didn’t know how this was going to go, so I actually think there’s a basis to move forward with a plan that we would draw up and then send out to people early next week. We have a scheduled call, another FOMC call, next Friday, which we are happy to do. If people would rather not do that and do it by notation vote, we could do that. I sort of sense it would be better to have the second call. So, after this, I’ll open it up for questions and comments on that. It would be something, too, I think, that I would probably not leave to Q&A in my Tuesday speech. I think I would drop a couple of pages in at the end of the speech, which would load. I think it could foreshadow the decision that we then make on Friday, again, drawing away from the undesirable shock-and-awe factor a little bit, I would hope. The plan would be some pace of asset purchases that covers the consensus of the Committee. There were “slowers,” there were “faster pluses,” but I think we’ll be somewhere in the middle, maybe, with the regular number 7. So I’ll put that out as a possible way to proceed, And then why don’t we—Thomas, do you have something that you wanted to add to that? Or no?","Conference Call","Press Conf",". .","384","2019-10"
"2019-10-04","Thank you. And thank you for an exceptionally good set of comments from everybody. There is, as always, a healthy diversity, but I think there’s also a consensus that I see in that on some fundamental aspects of a plan. And I’ll come back to that at the end. Let me offer a couple of comments in the meantime. In January, we made a decision to continue what we called an “ample-reserves framework,” and we defined that as meaning that we wouldn’t be going in and out of the market with open market operations with any frequency. And we thought about that for years, and there were risks to making that decision. But we made it, and we explained it clearly, and it was well accepted. I think all of the risk now is to the credibility of that decision. We now need to follow through on that decision robustly, and that’s where the risk is now. It’s not on the other side, as it might have been before we made the decision. So that means, if you think about what the right level of reserves is—I think this is something we need to fine-tune a little bit, but the idea of early September may not be quite right. The idea of current operations, maybe, plus a buffer, as Lael just suggested, something like that. I think the market will need a focal point, and language like “at least,” “a bit above,” “learning as we go,” “uncertainty”—stressing all of those things are healthy. But I do think we need something like that. And, of course, let’s agree that we really don’t know. We really don’t know. you think the equilibrium level is, the volatility around that number is much faster and much bigger than I guess I had intuited. So that means we’re going to be using a lot of language that’s not so much about a level as about the framework and that sort of thing. It’s also worth remembering, there’s a long list of things that can affect—in a downward direction—the demand for reserves, and that includes daylight overdrafts, it includes changes to our Payment System Risk (PSR) policy, it includes internal liquidity stress tests, it includes the issue of Treasuries and reserves and the related issue of having a standing repo facility. Also, the other liabilities—Lorie mentioned this at the beginning, the foreign repo pool and the Treasury General Account (TGA). The TGA we think of as—I mean, it’s so big. We think of it as not part of this—because it’s really the Treasury’s call and all that. But it’s so big and it can move so much. I think it’s worth thinking about whether there aren’t ways to somehow manage its outsized effects on reserves. So there’s a lot that can be going on in the meantime. None of it is going to help us by year-end, or not much of it. So I think the actual answer may be quite different than what we think it is now, which again stresses the need for not being too precise. So why go before the meeting? I think this is a question that we have all been thinking about a lot, and I think the pros and cons were articulated very well by various people. I’ll give you the three reasons for going before the meeting. First, it really creates a separation from the monetary policy decision we make one way or the other at the end of October. Second, as John pointed out, right now we’re right where we need to be with markets. If we don’t do anything for three and a half weeks—25 days or 26 days—I suspect there will be, well before that, a lot of sentiment, like, “Where are they?” So pretty soon we’ll be “behind the curve.” The third thing As both Lael and Neel pointed out, the issue is, doing something off-cycle does draw attention to it. And there, I think, the communication, if you listened to what Thomas said—and this isn’t in what was handed out, but what he said was, “One approach would be to state that you will be conducting outright purchases and term repo operations as necessary to achieve and maintain your desired level of reserves","Conference Call","Press Conf","CHAIR POWELL","710","2019-10"
"2019-10-04","Yes, send it out for comment and then later for a vote. Let me come back to the timing issue that Neel and Lael raised. Of course, we don’t know what we’re going to do on monetary policy at the October meeting, but if you’re in a situation in which you’re cutting and you’re also announcing this, I don’t know how the headline doesn’t be “Fed Cuts Rates, Restarts Asset Purchases.” For all the talking you do, I just think it would be so hard to break that link, because there’s just too much news. You know, this is a coin flipper. It’s a very close call. Anyway, that’s what I worry about. Also, I think, after I speak—and John will speak, too, I guess—they’ll know it’s coming, and they may be speculating that it might be coming sooner, and then it should reduce the drama of the thing if it’s already been heavily foreshadowed. Any other comments or questions? [No response] So everybody is good with this? President Bullard. and separating it more from the FOMC meeting is probably a good idea. I don’t know if we could get a midweek vote or something. Not that I want to press people too hard, but we already had the discussion here, and probably a proposal that takes into account some of the comments here could be approved relatively rapidly, maybe next—midweek or something?","Conference Call","Press Conf","CHAIR POWELL","233","2019-10"
"2019-10-04","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Like many others, I support the faster plan on Lorie’s chart, graph 7. Like many others, I worry that it’s a little too conservative, and that the cost of being too conservative far outweighs the cost of being more aggressive. And so I would err on the side of being less specific about the level of reserves and erring on the side that we don’t run into some kind of problem at year-end, just so that we do this one and done, and that we bridge ourselves to whatever our long-term solution is. I think that I am the outlier in being less in favor of a midmeeting announcement. I guess my reaction is, that seems highly unusual. I don’t know the last time the Committee put out a formal statement between meetings. I imagine the staff knows. I don’t know the answer to that. That feels like a strategy to maximize attention on this. And if we’re trying to signal that this is a technical procedure, just for monetary policy implementation, in my mind it does the opposite of that. It’s calling maximum attention to it. adjusting the federal funds rate, it would strike me that we could announce this concurrent with our normal FOMC meeting, and this would be more technical in nature, rather than maximizing the spotlight on any notion that we’re doing something profound here. The Committee hasn’t done intermeeting in a very, very long time. Again, obviously, I’m the only person who appears to have that view, so there is the wisdom of crowds. I’ll turn to the ceiling facility. I am in favor of serious consideration of a ceiling facility. I think one thing that I have learned in this is that the discount window is hopelessly stigmatized. I thought that the stigma was because we had a penalty rate, but, boy, markets just blew through the penalty rate and didn’t even look at it. And so I think we do need some type of ceiling facility. But this comes back to, what do we mean by “ample reserves” or “abundant reserves”? If we design the system so that the ceiling facility is never going to be used, it will be stigmatized. So somehow we need to have a very robust conversation about how frequently we expect that ceiling facility to be utilized. And it can’t be never, because then we’re going to be right back where we are right now. We need to accommodate the fact that it will be regularly utilized, so that people do not view that as a sign of weakness. It’s just a sign of regular monetary policy implementation. So we may end up in ample but not abundant reserves—we’ll have to have a robust discussion about that. And then, when we design it, my view would be as wide a range of counterparties as we can get comfortable with, so that we don’t have this disintermediation problem.

"2019-10-04","Thank you, Chair Powell. I’d also like to thank the staff for the work that they have done to help us prepare for the discussion and the many discussions I have had with our staff to better understand the situation. In the short time that I’ve been on the Until last month, we had seen some volatility surrounding these events. But nothing compared with what we saw in September. Since then, we’ve learned a few things. First, I think that we are much closer than I thought to the minimum level of reserves sufficient to maintain control over the federal funds rate. Second, we have learned that repo rates can move significantly in response to the lack of supply and an increased demand for overnight funding, and that this was a surprise to both us and to the markets. And we saw those rates influence other short-term funding markets. To me, this indicates that we need to try to understand and narrow down the potential causes, whether it was the level of the balance sheet, the result of post-crisis regulation as Governor Quarles and Presidents Harker and Bullard have described, or something else entirely. In any case, it appears that we have come close to the lowest comfortable level of reserves, and, therefore, it’s wise to consider increasing the size of our balance sheet before year- end. So today, with the limited information available, if asked to choose among the options that the staff proposed, my preference would be for the second option, which combines the slower pace of Treasury bill purchases with increased overnight and term repo operations. This option seems more straightforward to communicate, and it minimizes the risk that our actions are disruptive to the short-term Treasury securities markets. Further, the smaller monthly purchases may be less likely to be linked with quantitative easing if we can communicate clearly. Beyond these operations, for the longer term, I think we should consider the advanced scheduling of overnight and term repo market operations to be held on three dates or during time frames when we anticipate these markets will face pressures because of quarterly tax filings or the size of our balance sheet. If we find we don’t need them, we could phase them out over time. As many have also discussed, it would also be helpful for us to reconsider what we think the minimum comfortable level of reserves is, incorporating our experiences of the past few weeks into the staff’s ongoing research in this area. I would prefer a level that could be sustained without frequent discussion points or interventions, if possible. I’d also like to see further analysis from the staff on whether these events were partly the result of changes to financial supervision or regulation. Thank you, Mr. Chair.","Conference Call","Press Conf","MS. BOWMAN","464","2019-10"
"2019-10-04","Thank you. Governor Brainard. principles. First, our primary goal has to be to maintain good control of the policy rate and effective transmission to other money markets in the financial system. Our secondary goal should be a parsimonious operating framework that accommodates swings in nonreserve liabilities and other changes in supplies and demands without necessitating frequent, large open market operations or risking spikes in the funds rate. And, third, we should aim for simplicity and clarity to the greatest extent possible to separate these technical execution issues from communications about the stance of monetary policy. Those principles led me in November and December of last year to favor ensuring, I think, what is really abundant reserves such that we can be confident that the amount of reserves is more than adequate to meet demand and, thus, provide effective interest rate control. I don’t believe that there are any merits to probing for the lowest level of reserves, particularly in a late- cycle environment when markets are fragile and prone to volatility and misinterpretation. And this is simply repeating, I think, what I said earlier. The process of probing for the kink between the flat and steep part of the demand curve or for the lowest efficient level of reserves is likely to be fraught. It will necessarily entail spikes in federal funds rate volatility. New operations would be needed to contain that volatility, and that is, I think, what we’ve been observing over the past few weeks. So based on that, I do prefer—I guess, would like to see an option 1 prime, perhaps option 1 as amended by Presidents Rosengren, Daly, Evans, Kaplan. I think it’s a long list now. It would be good to see what a more aggressive rebuilding strategy would look like, perhaps going beyond bills to short coupon securities. Maybe there are risks there, so I would like to see proactive and creating a framework rather than being reactive to market developments and relying for a prolonged period on ad hoc operations. So option 2, I think, could be justified, but I do worry that it looks like we will be relying to a greater extent on more reactive, ad hoc operations than an abundant-reserves or an ample-reserves regime would seem to imply. With regard to communications, I think I will make President Kashkari slightly less of an outlier. I had similar kind of instincts when I first saw these options, mostly because I worry that, first of all, there’s not a huge gap between when we would be able to make this decision and when we have our FOMC meeting. But the perception of going out of cycle might put this more in the realm of looking like we’re responding to some kind of financial-stability concerns or that this really is an emergency. And, in fact, this just goes to the core of our execution of monetary policy. I think it’s an opportunity for the FOMC, in regular-cycle communications, to say, “This is what an ample-reserves regime looks like, and that is why we’re building up the level of reserves—to amply satisfy demand.” So, also, just in terms of—it is a difficult communication. I, on balance, would prefer to see the Chair be able to incorporate it into a press conference statement, because that allows us to distinguish between what is an execution decision and a stance-of-policy decision. I do agree with those who have said it does need to be a separate statement. And then, finally, I think I agree with President Bostic. I found the September reference point a little confusing until Governor Clarida explained the connection to previous communications. To me, it would have seemed more natural to say, “We actually have gone out and offered operations, and the level of demand is clearly at the upper end of the range of So let me just conclude by saying “Thank you” to Vice Chair Williams and to the staff across the System.

"2019-10-04","Thank you. Look, to my mind, controlling the funds rate and being able to make sure that we don’t have spikes in these money market rates is the highest priority. And also demonstrating that we have that control is very important, as President Rosengren said. Controlling the narrative is in our hands here, and we have an opportunity to do that. This is very consistent with what Vice Chair Williams said. We said we were going to be looking at how market interest rates were going and how reserves were being distributed across the system, and that’s what we’ve been doing. And what we’ve learned is that perhaps we need a higher level of reserves than we thought, and maybe we need higher buffers than we thought, given that events can actually change the desired levels that any one bank will have. I just would point out that the distributional issues mean that there is a lot of uncertainty about what the aggregate level of reserves is going to be needed, and that’s something else that we learned. So I do think that we have to take some actions here even if we’d like banks to be doing it for us, and the actions laid out seem to be appropriate ones. bit higher, because the underrun in April next year suggests that maybe we should get levels up sooner rather than later and higher than what’s suggested in the memos. In terms of communications, I would communicate as soon as we feasibly can. I see no reason to wait. I think this gives us the best chance to separate this from a decision on monetary policy if we do it well ahead of the October meeting. I’m not concerned with engendering a sense of urgency, as the memo pointed out, as one of the reasons to go later. I already think the markets have a sense of urgency here, and going in and addressing it, I think, could actually be calming to the markets and reassuring to the markets. I don’t think it would actually be viewed badly. And it also means we’d be able to control the narrative. In terms of communicating the level—the September level or a dollar level—I would be circumspect, because we don’t really know how much we’re going to be needing to do. So I think the message has got to be, “We’ve noticed the volatility, we want to address it, and this is a plan for addressing it. And we will continue to monitor things and go back in as needed to make sure that we are supplying the level of reserves that’s necessary.” And if I were doing the communications, I would actually do a statement, but I also would put out FAQs, because you can then take all the questions that you think you’re going to be getting and write them out, so that people will be able to understand.

"2019-10-04","I think we shuffled the cards here. straightforward way. I have to say, the overarching issue that stuck in my mind was the tremendous amount of uncertainty that remains regarding the dynamics that drove this, and that really shapes how I think about the potential actions in moving forward and how we should consider these policies. Let me start with the two options that were offered as the potential strategies. The first: rapid Treasury purchases covered with supplemental term repos, I do believe this offers a pathway for achieving our coming close to the September benchmark. And I have confidence that this can be executed, but, like others, I am concerned about the signal that this could potentially send. It could trigger several lines of thought that could be potentially destabilizing for the economy. As some have noted—as pretty much everyone has noted—it could lead people to think that we are engaging in QE again, because of some concerns that the economy is weaker than the top-line numbers might suggest. And this concern is credible, I think, because the action that we will do will be at the scale comparable to what we did in QE, and it would last for several months. A second possibility is that some could see this as analogous to the financial market breakdowns that preceded the Great Recession, and neither of these would be good, and so the strategy would rely heavily on our communications to make the point that this is not actually what’s driving things. I came into the discussion feeling pretty nervous about this. I think that the discussion today has made me a little more confident that we can accomplish this. I do believe that the speed at which this volatility emerged gives us a real opportunity to say, “Look, I would just say that the second strategy leaves me really concerned, because it relies heavily on the consistent engagement of primary dealers. The memos and the discussion today have made it pretty clear that support from this group is not rock solid, and so a strategy that relies on them gives me some pause. So, given all that, I would “lean toward,” and support, faster-paced Treasury security purchases and moving more dramatically. And I would echo a point that was made by a number of people: Let’s figure out how we get to the desired level as fast as possible. So the approach of Rosengren, Daly, and others to try to front-load this really has some appeal to me. I think the longer this goes, the larger the possibility that there is some confusion or conflicting narratives that emerge. I would share the concern or the question about the focus on a September benchmark as a focal point for a level of reserves that we should move forward. As I was reading the memos, I really question why we would be comfortable there, particularly because the events that triggered the current crisis were modest and were fully predictable. And so the question I ask is, what would happen if something larger happens or if something unpredicted happens? If we’re just at September, I fear that we could be right back in this circus. So, to be safe, I think that there’s some value in having additional buffer above and beyond that September level, and I think this would be prudent. And that comes back to the uncertainty. There is still a lot that we have to learn, and so as we’re learning, I think there would be value in us not trying to be so precise in identifying a level. that an important part of this communication should focus on the real uncertainty that exists in the marketplace, and that we are learning as we go. This is a new space for us, and so this should not be expected to be the last adjustment that we make but rather an evolution toward a deeper understanding of the market and getting us to an optimal policy stance.

"2019-10-04","Good morning—or afternoon—everyone. Thanks for joining the videoconference today on such short notice. I know that a number of us had to change plans to participate, and I appreciate that. I also want to thank the staff for going, really, all out since the previous meeting to bring us to this point today, when we can begin to consider a plan to get through near-term issues and from there to a stable longer-run equilibrium. We’re here to discuss the recent pressures in money markets, the steps we’ve taken so far to address those pressures, and the path forward. The matter is time sensitive, hence the need to meet today rather than wait for the next scheduled meeting at the end of October. As I noted in my email to you earlier this week, we do not need to reach any formal decisions at this meeting. However, as you will see from the briefings, we will need to reach consensus soon on a reasonable near-term plan and an associated communications strategy. Nonetheless, there will be sufficient opportunity to weigh the options, express our views, and work expeditiously to reach consensus. After the briefings, we will have a Q&A round, an opportunity to comment, and then an open discussion. As you all know, the story is a complicated one, and there are many causal factors at work. So our plan will need to involve both measures to relieve pressures that are set to intensify in the near term as well as potential measures that improve liquidity conditions over time, but that will take months of careful consideration before they can be decided on and implemented. Our main focus here today needs to be on the former: measures to get us through the end of the year and through the April tax payment season, as we’ll discuss. If we can agree on the broad outlines of our approach at this meeting, I will ask the staff to develop specific plans and communications for us to review. One option is that we would discuss, revise, and vote at a That is three and a half weeks away. There are concerns that waiting that long runs the risk of being “behind the curve,” because markets have already figured this out by now. So that’s the plan for the meeting. If there are no questions on that, then what we’ll do is go ahead and move to the briefings from Patricia, Lorie, and Thomas. Patricia, would you like to begin?","Conference Call","Press Conf","CHAIR POWELL","414","2019-10"
"2019-10-04","1 Thank you, Mr. Chair. Since the decision in January 2019 to remain in an ample-reserves regime, the Committee has communicated that it is on a path toward the most efficient and effective level of reserves for that regime. This initially involved relatively rapid reductions in reserves through asset redemptions and growth in nonreserve liabilities. In March, the Committee tapered asset redemptions, slowing the pace of reserve decline, and in July, the Committee ended redemptions entirely. Recent developments suggest that it may be appropriate for the FOMC to consider next steps in the process of transitioning to the efficient and effective level of reserves. I’ll start with a review of what we learned in September and the effects of our operations on market conditions. Then, I’ll discuss the outlook for the remainder of the year and what market participants are expecting. Lorie will review some key tradeoffs bearing on options that the FOMC may consider to maintain reserve levels and provide greater assurances of interest rate control, particularly around year-end. I’ll refer to exhibit 1. As shown in panel 1, overnight money market rates rose sharply the week of September 16, with contacts reporting poor liquidity and elevated uncertainty about funding market conditions. These developments also had spillover effects, with commercial paper rates and dollar borrowing costs in FX swaps rising notably. Treasury securities market liquidity in off-the-run securities deteriorated, and the Treasury cash-futures basis widened. While there had been some upward pressure in money markets on previous corporate tax payment dates, the magnitude of the moves in September was surprising. The staff analysis and market commentary has pointed to a confluence of factors related to the mid-September tax payment date and Treasury settlement. First, money fund lending in repo markets, which had been declining before mid- September, dropped sharply the week of September 16 as shown by the decline in sponsored lending volumes in the centrally cleared repo market in panel 2. The reduction in money fund repo lending resulted in a widening of the distribution of 1 The materials used by Mses. Zobel and Logan are appended to this transcript (appendix 1). sources of funding and were willing to pay substantially higher rates in order to finance positions. Second, pressures in secured markets spilled over into unsecured markets and lenders pulled back from federal funds and Eurodollars out of caution about potential outflows related to tax payments or to lend at higher rates in repo. As shown in panel 4, FBOs and small domestic banks experienced notable outflows, while","Conference Call","Press Conf","MS. ZOBEL","421","2019-10"
"2019-10-04","G-SIBs retained reserve balances. These larger institutions held reserves well above their lowest comfortable levels of reserves, but didn’t increase lending in repo or in federal funds in response to higher rates. Other banks that were close to their lowest comfortable levels of reserves paid significantly higher rates in unsecured markets to defend their reserve positions. As shown in panel 5, over September 16 and 17, 70 percent of federal funds volume consisted of SFOS panel banks whose reserve balances had fallen near or below their lowest comfortable level of reserves. Funding markets in the past have been able to absorb similarly sized shocks associated with tax and Treasury settlement dates. However, one lesson from this experience may be that, against the backdrop of elevated Treasury debt issuance and declining reserves, smaller shocks can have more pronounced effects on markets. Internal risk limits and balance sheet costs seem to play a role in slowing the distribution of liquidity across the system and amplifying the shock, as financial institutions require high spreads to intermediate. A second lesson is that a higher level of reserves may be needed to accommodate distributional frictions in reserve markets. Some banks have elevated demand for reserves on days of high expected outflows, and even those that have surplus reserves may choose not to lend to other firms even at higher rates. In order to help maintain the federal funds rate within the target range, the Desk conducted large-scale repo operations starting on September 17. These played an important role in calming markets and improving funding market conditions. The addition of term operations helped provide assurances to market participants about funding markets over quarter-end. And at its peak, participation in the Desk’s overnight and term operations added $203 billion of reserves, as shown in panel 6. With these operations, September quarter-end conditions were stable, although rates were still somewhat elevated relative to recent quarter-end dates. Some of the higher repo rates passed through to the federal funds market, and the distribution of rates traded in federal funds was wider than normal. In looking ahead, market participants have expressed uncertainty about how funding market conditions may evolve after the currently announced open market operations (OMOs) roll off. As shown in the table in the Appendix, the Desk’s three term operations will mature by October 11, and the overnight operations will also expire. Market participants are also concerned about funding market conditions Forward measures of money market rates through year-end indicate expectations that pressures may build between now and December. Term repo rates remain somewhat elevated relative to overnight index swaps, and indicative pricing in repo markets for the year-end has been between 3 and 4 percent. Nearly all money market analysts expect permanent open market operations to be announced at the October meeting. Several of these analysts have indicated initial purchases are likely to be larger than purchases needed to offset organic growth in nonreserve liabilities in order to maintain reserves at current or higher levels. Analysts expect the size of these purchases to be around $225 billion, though estimates range from below $200 billion to as high as $400 billion. Expectations are split as to whether these purchases would be concentrated in Treasury bills, short coupon securities, or across the curve. I’ll turn it over to Lorie to discuss options the FOMC may consider.","Conference Call","Press Conf","U.S","557","2019-10"
"2019-10-04","Thank you, Patricia. I’ll be referring to exhibit 2. As Patricia noted, recent developments suggest that it’s appropriate to consider next steps in the transition process to the most efficient and effective level of reserves. In the near term, one step the Committee could consider is directing the Desk to maintain reserve levels similar to the average level in early September. This would entail operations to maintain the reserves created through recent operations and offset future growth of nonreserve liabilities. Second, the Desk could execute overnight repo operations each day through year-end to provide a shock absorber to support control of the federal funds rate in addition to maintaining reserves similar to the early September average. These two steps could provide more assurance of rate control as the Committee considers longer-run strategies to maintain an ample-reserves regime, which might include considerations relevant to reducing reserve demand or the establishment of a standing repo facility. My briefing today centers on how to reduce the risk of volatility in funding markets over the near term while providing time for the Committee to consider these longer-term issues. If the Committee wishes to maintain reserve levels close to, or moderately above, those that prevailed in early September, a fairly sizable amount of open market operations would be required. The actions taken by the Desk to address pressures in money markets over the second half of September lifted reserve levels by around $100 billion on average during the latter half of the month to just above $1.4 trillion. Absent further open market operations, reserves will decline significantly over coming months. The staff estimate that the SOMA would likely need to increase by at least $250 billion by the end of 2019 and by more than $350 billion to maintain a similar level of reserves through April of next year. Our current forecast of reserves is shown in grey in panel 7. In the memo, two illustrative scenarios using both Treasury bill purchases and term repos are presented to maintain reserve levels around $1.45 trillion, the average relate to communications and the capacity of the market to smoothly absorb these operations. In the first scenario shown in panel 7, Treasury securities are purchased in the secondary market at a faster pace. This quicker pace of purchases means there is somewhat less reliance on repo operations to add reserves, which might improve the intermediation of reserves by relying less on primary dealers that may face balance constraints to do repo, particularly around year-end. The advantage of relying more heavily on outright purchases is that the Treasury market is deep and liquid, and can absorb a fairly high volume of transactions. Outright purchases also lay a permanent base of reserves, which can reduce the size of operations needed to maintain reserve levels in the future. In panel 7, we assumed purchases of Treasury bills of around $60 billion per month, which could make a significant contribution toward filling the reserve need by year-end. We will learn more about the capacity of the Treasury market to absorb our operations through experience and could find that we are comfortably able to purchase more than this amount or possibly somewhat less. I should note that the addition of a broader “universe” of Treasury securities, such as those notes and bonds having only a few years to maturity, would likely add to the capacity. Now, Treasury security purchases do have some drawbacks. Large purchases of Treasury securities might have some chance of being conflated with quantitative easing, particularly by a broader audience that is less familiar with the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet. Purchasing Treasury bills may reduce this association, because they are money market instruments with limited duration and doing so would not materially change the quantity of duration in the private sector’s hands or the total term premium effect of the SOMA portfolio, all else being equal. However, to the broader public, this distinction might not be apparent. The second scenario, shown in panel 8, relies more heavily on repo market operations to achieve the desired level of reserves. Repo operations have been successful at restoring calm in money markets in recent weeks, as Patricia discussed. As such, repo would be an important component of any plan. However, there are important limitations of repo operations, particularly around year-end. Operating in the repo market depends heavily on primary dealer balance sheet capacity and willingness to intermediate to the broader market. As dealers manage their balance sheets closely into year-end, they may have less capacity to take up large amounts of term repo and lend this onward because of these constraints. As shown in panel 8, a greater reliance on term operations may make it somewhat more difficult to achieve the reserve level objective. In this scenario, we use the September quarter-end experience as a guide to how much term repo can be sustained. Overnight repo operations could supplement these term operations, of course, but as a backstop to rates. We cannot estimate with assurance how much overnight take-up we might see, so they’re not shown in the panel. the communications, and then purchase higher levels of securities heading into year- end. Higher levels of purchases in December may be more easily explained as associated with the year-end downdraft in reserves and balance sheet constraints. In any approach, it may take some time to maintain reserves near or above the levels that prevailed in early September. Faster purchases or higher repo take-up could help achieve the objective sooner, but it may still take some time. As the Desk works toward maintaining reserve levels, particularly around year- end, it seems appropriate to maintain overnight repo operations in order to provide a cushion against rate volatility that might occur and to enhance market participants’ confidence. The Desk would expect to offer $75 billion in overnight repos, with a minimum bid rate to","Conference Call","Press Conf","MS. LOGAN","977","2019-10"
"2019-10-04","However, the parameters of these operations could be adjusted if conditions warrant. For example, the minimum bid rate could be adjusted higher if take-up in the operations warranted and bid rates were settling near the minimum bid rate. Alternatively, if higher pressures were expected, the offering size could be increased and the minimum bid rate lowered. Before concluding, I want to make one near-term note on the current repo operations. After further consideration, we made one adjustment to the planned repo operations in the draft Desk statement we circulated to the Committee in advance of this meeting. To maintain continuity with the current amount of outstanding term repo and based upon feedback from counterparties, we will modestly increase the offering sizes of the term operations through November 4. This Desk statement outlining the continuation of overnight and term operations is slated for release after today’s meeting. These operations are consistent with the domestic policy directive to the Desk that the Committee adopted at its previous meeting and do not require Committee action at this meeting. I’ll now turn it over to Thomas, who will discuss related communications issues.","Conference Call","Press Conf","IOER","188","2019-10"
"2019-10-04","2 Thank you, Lorie. I will be referring to the handout “Material for the Briefing on Communications Considerations regarding Plans for Open Market Operations.” If the Committee were to agree on a plan for the growth of its Treasury securities holdings as well as repo operations over the rest of this year and into next, it may wish to issue a statement to communicate this decision to the public. Depending on the timing of your decision, you could issue this statement following your regularly scheduled October meeting or well before then. Even in the former case, you may want to issue this statement separately from your regular postmeeting statement to emphasize that these balance sheet decisions are distinct from the choice of the policy stance. Regarding the timing of this statement, as Lorie highlighted, announcing your decisions before the October meeting would provide more time for Treasury security 2 The materials used by Mr. Laubach are appended to this transcript (appendix 2). May 2010, and as of earlier this week most market participants didn’t seem to expect an announcement about reserve maintenance purchases before October 30. Turning to the possible content of such a statement: You could highlight the continuity and consistency of your decision with previous communications by referring to your January 2019 decision that you intend to maintain an ample supply of reserves so that control over the federal funds rate and other short-term interest rates is exercised primarily through the setting of administered rates. One important consideration in formulating such a statement is how you would describe the level of reserves you wish to maintain over time. The options that Lorie presented are predicated on the view that, in light of the experience of recent weeks, it is prudent to maintain a level of reserves at or moderately above those prevailing in early September, before the sharp decline around the middle of the month. Communicating this intention would provide assurance to market participants that your operations will be sufficiently large to prevent reserves from running much below $1.5 trillion. Another consideration is how specific to be about the mix and size of outright purchases and of term and overnight repo operations. One approach would be to state that you will be conducting outright purchases and term repo operations as necessary to achieve and maintain your desired level of reserves, and that, in addition, you will continue to offer overnight repo operations to lower the risk of money market pressures that could adversely affect the implementation of monetary policy. Specific amounts for the pace of outright purchases and the size and other terms of term and overnight repo operations could then be announced by the Desk and adjusted over time if needed. More generally, in light of the uncertainty surrounding the level of reserves most consistent with efficient and effective implementation, it might well be prudent to emphasize that you will continue to monitor money market developments as you assess what that level is, and that you stand ready to adjust the details of these plans as necessary.

"2019-10-04","So the time frame that we show in the two illustrative examples, using a combination of the two tools we discussed—the term repos and the purchases—would take about a month to reach those levels. But, again, these are just illustrative, and they depend importantly on the date at which the purchases or the term repos would begin, as well as the overall size. And so that time can be shortened or lengthened, depending on the tradeoffs that the Committee discusses today regarding the two tools.","Conference Call","Press Conf","MS. LOGAN","85","2019-10"

"2019-10-04","As in the illustrative examples we’ve shown, yes, I think at the beginning it’s weeks, but I would note that, in the second illustrative example as well as the top, there are other periods over the course of these three months when the combination of those two tools still leaves reserves a little bit short of that objective. Now, it’s important to note that the overnight repos would also be available, and so they’re not shown on these charts because we don’t know for sure what the take-up would be. But, you know, we could expect that those reserve levels will probably be above those in later parts of the forecast, but we can’t be certain.","Conference Call","Press Conf","MS.

"2019-10-04","All right. Thank you. That’s all I had, Mr. Chairman.","Conference Call","Press Conf","MS. GEORGE","10","2019-10"
"2019-10-04","Yes. Just one question, with respect to clarification. So I think I understood from the briefing that a significant problem in continuing with ad hoc operations until we could make, perhaps, more permanent changes that may be affecting incentives for the market but as a way of addressing the current shortfall, I think I understood that that had to do with the capacity of the balance sheets of the counterparties as to why we thought those ad hoc operations might be—that that might be an unsustainable way to proceed. So am I correct about that as to that being a problem, or are there problems, as well as the length of time we might be doing that, that could be perceived as undermining our commitment to an ample-reserves regime? And then I have a question—that is, if the former is the case, one of the things that has been thought about for the longer term—and although we’re talking about the shorter term today, I just wanted to make sure that I understand this as well, because it does affect a little bit how I think what we ought to do in the shorter term. For the longer term, is that an element of—a longer-term response could be the implementation of a kind of a standing repo facility, which I had understood would be kind of an Eddie Murphy–Dan Aykroyd in Trading Places—you know, “Bring ’em on. We’ll take them all.” And is that the case? And if that’s the case as to what the repo facility would be, how does it work that’s different from these ad hoc operations, which might be limited by the capacity of the counterparties? That’s it.","Conference Call","Press Conf","MR. QUARLES","281","2019-10"
"2019-10-04","Okay, thank you. So, in terms of the temporary repo market operations, I think you raised two important points. One of the limitations of the temporary open market operations that we discussed is related to the balance sheet constraints that you were talking on to other market participants—that does gross up their balance sheet. And particularly as we’re moving into your end, we’ve heard from them already that they would be unlikely to do that sort of intermediation that they started to do in these early days of September. Now, they would do some of it, but probably not to the degree that they have been doing it. So we do see this intermediation and balance sheet constraint as a key limitation of the temporary open market operations. I think the second point you raised about the commitment—you know, I do think that market participants have a view that purchases are more in line with the ample-reserves regime in terms of the permanent base of reserves that would be maintained. But that’s not a theme that we’ve been hearing a lot about right now, for the short term. I would say the other consideration and limitation of using temporary open market operations, as opposed to purchases, is that, as you can see in the forecast, sometimes the increase in nonreserve liabilities and, therefore, the drop in reserves can be quite large and very swift. And if you use permanent purchases to get ahead of that so that there’s a buffer, then we’re more likely to be able to maintain that minimum level of reserves. If you rely just on the temporary open market operations to fill that gap in those periods that you can see in gray, one, we might not have the capacity, and, two, it’s a very sudden shift in the Federal Reserve’s operations with the private sector to try to fill that large of a hole in that short amount of time. So, I would say, there are three types of constraints we’re talking about with the temporary open market operations: one, the balance sheet limitations; two, the commitment to the ample-reserves regime, though I don’t think that’s been in play in the short run; and then,","Conference Call","Press Conf","MS.

"2019-10-04","Yes. The only question is for Lorie, and I think I know your view on this—I assume you would assert that the “faster” approach versus the “slower” approach gives you greater confidence that we would meet the objective of returning to the early September reserves target and put us in the best position to deal with year-end demands, that the faster approach would give you more confidence we’ll achieve those objectives than the slower approach?","Conference Call","Press Conf","MR. KAPLAN","75","2019-10"
"2019-10-04","From a purely operational perspective, as we noted in the memo, I think the first illustrative example would, of course, give us more confidence of being able to maintain that level of reserves. But also as discussed in the memos, there are important tradeoffs that the Committee would need to make, related to communications and whether the broader public might interpret those larger purchases at the beginning as potential quantitative easing (QE). And I think that’s a broader tradeoff for the Committee to consider. But from a purely operational perspective, the first illustrative example would give us more confidence.","Conference Call","Press Conf","MS. LOGAN","99","2019-10"

"2019-10-04","Yes. I may be wrong, but I think Governor Quarles also asked you about the temporary versus the standing repo facility and how to think about that, and I thought that was an important question. Lorie, I don’t know if you want to come back in on that. October on the idea of a standing repo facility. First, I think we have learned that the repo operations generally are effective. They have brought down rates, and they have calmed markets through the use of a repo-type operation. This wasn’t a standing facility but had some similar features that, I think, would be effective. We have also learned, though, that there is not perfect pass-through from the type of counterparties that we have. Currently, we rely on primary dealers involved in that, those repo operations. And as we discussed in answer to the question from Governor Quarles, those dealer balance sheets are not fully elastic, and so the pass-through and intermediation is not very smooth. There are some frictions there. For example, the dealers that are coming into our operations and then on-lending are charging quite a bit of a spread to those who don’t have access to the operations. The other thing I think we have learned through this process—not specific to the open market operations, but to the money market conditions more broadly—is that we did see that 15 banks did borrow in federal funds or unsecured markets at rates above the discount rate. So, you know, there is stigma associated with the discount window that we can evidently see. And I think it would be important, when designing a standing repo facility, to consider what type of restrictions or communications surround it, so that that type of stigma wouldn’t also apply to this facility. So I think issues regarding the counterparties that would be appropriate for a permanent standing repo facility would be an important discussion in October—the appropriate rates as well","Conference Call","Press Conf","MS.

"2019-10-04","Okay, thank you. No one so far has visibly raised his or her hand. Oh, there’s someone. Is that—President Evans.","Conference Call","Press Conf","CHAIR POWELL","20","2019-10"
"2019-10-04","Thank you, Mr. Chair. I have a couple of questions. I guess the first one starts from the options for communications, the second bullet, which highlights that we can “highlight continuity with our January 2019 decision to maintain an ample supply of reserves so that control over the federal funds rate and other short-term interest rates is exercised primarily through the setting of administered rates.” That got my attention, because I know that we have talked about administered rates being the focal point for how we establish the federal funds rate within our target range. But, you know, it seems that’s highly dependent on the level of reserves that we have, because as we have had to move the interest rate on excess reserves (IOER) lower into the target range, the funds rate is trading above that, and the IOER rate and the overnight reverse repurchase (ON RRP) rate are lower than that. And it seems that it’s more money market arbitrage that is determining the funds rate. If we really wanted—so I’m a little concerned about highlighting administered rates there. That’s one part of the question. But the other one would be, it seems quite related to the size of reserves. If we had greater levels of reserves so that it is the arbitrage for the administered rates, then it could be consistent with this point. Is there some relationship between the level of reserves and the emphasis on administered rates? I mean, that’s a combination of questions maybe for Thomas and the Desk. that the federal funds rate is trading reliably within the target range. I don’t necessarily see a strict relationship there between the level of the federal funds rate and the level of the administered rates. So if you have a mechanism by which you set the administered rates and the federal funds rate—for example, trades above the administered rates—but you have firm control of the federal funds rate within the target range, that would seem to me to be one version that is consistent with what you expressed, because, basically, it is, as you move the administered rates, the federal funds rate is really closely tied to them. In contrast—right?—if you had, for example, a situation in which you have signs of reserve scarcity, then you have high-frequency fluctuations in factors affecting reserve supply, like the things we have seen with tax dates, et cetera. And then what you might see is that, actually, the link between your administered rates and the federal funds rate becomes a lot more volatile. And so that might be the situation that I would interpret your statement as indicating you wanted to avoid. Lorie or Patricia, I don’t know if you have thoughts.","Conference Call","Press Conf","MR. EVANS","454","2019-10"
"2019-10-04","Thank you, Thomas. I think that all sounds right. I think the only thing that we would add is that, over the course of this year, we have seen a relationship emerging, as you noted, between changes in the reserves supply and changes in the federal funds rate. And so, at higher reserve levels, maybe last March, we saw a lower degree of that relationship—and rates that were more centered and more stable above the IOER rate. And there was less dispersion in the federal funds and Eurodollar markets than we saw over the course of the summer and, most certainly, more recently. I think we saw a little bit of that relationship emerging, and then, most","Conference Call","Press Conf","MS. ZOBEL","117","2019-10"

"2019-10-04","Okay, all right. If I could ask a second question—the communications memo points to us talking about early September levels of reserves—the documents are prepared. So I guess my question is, early September size of reserve balances—that’s a focal point. I’m trying to be careful here. I’m not asking anybody for what they think of as the optimal size of reserves or anything, but it seemed to be a focal point from a time when things were working a little bit better. In preparation, I went back and thought a little bit about some other levels of reserves that have been mentioned. So back in December 2018, at the FOMC meeting, there was a presentation. And it was just mentioned that the level of reserves at that time, if we had sort of stopped reducing the runoff, would have been $1.74 trillion, and we shouldn’t have any difficulties with how money markets are functioning. That’s well north of where we are, so I guess that’s not so surprising. The early September number is about $1.45 trillion. But in March 2019, we had a presentation in which we talked about the Senior Financial Officer Survey estimates of comfortable levels of reserves and aggregated those—a little under $900 billion, I thought, was what they were pointing to. There were uncertainties associated with those estimated, a couple of buffers were added on top of that, and I think we got to what was supposed to be a pretty comfortable level of reserves—$1.1 trillion—or maybe it was $1.2 trillion, but it’s pretty far south from where we are. And that was our best thinking at the time. This is evolving, we’re learning about the markets, and so, you know, there’s good reason to think that that was a good market functioning should be pretty good if we were going to go that route. I’m just trying to figure out these other kinds of levels.","Conference Call","Press Conf","MR. EVANS","320","2019-10"

"2019-10-04","As we discussed in the memo, the focus that we took was to return reserve levels to early September, but also to combine that with the use of overnight RPs as a backstop. And we think that combination over these next three months will reduce volatility in money markets. And, more importantly, it will provide time for the Committee, I think, to make longer- term assessments—like the ones you’re raising, President Evans—about what the appropriate efficient and effective level of reserves is. I think, importantly, over that time, we can go back to some of those historical experiences and do more analysis about the type of relationships that Patricia was talking about. And we can think more deeply about the shape of the aggregate reserves demand curve and the type of distributional frictions that we saw. And it also gives the Committee time to think about some longer-run strategies about a standing repo facility or changes in other nonreserve liabilities or overall incentives to affect the demand for reserves. So our focus, really, here in the memo was on the next three months. And in the context of the next three months, I think that returning to that level is what is feasible in combination with the overnight RP and will give the Committee time to discuss these issues in more detail.","Conference Call","Press Conf","MS.

"2019-10-04","Now it is your turn to speak.","General","Speech","N/A","7","2019-10"
"2019-10-04","I can discuss that question in the context of the Senior Financial Officer Survey, which is how we’ve learned about reserve demand, and through conversations with market participants. The majority of the Senior Financial Officer Survey respondents noted that internal liquidity stress tests and high-payment flow days were the determinants of their lowest comfortable level of reserves (LCLoRs), and so each of those banks responded for their own estimates of what their stress payment outflows might be. Some banks consider this lowest comfortable level of reserves to be a hard floor. So it’s a governance minimum, and they tend to hold cushions above that to make sure they don’t breach that level. It could be that on high payment flow days, banks increase the cushion that they want to hold above those LCLoRs, and we heard a little bit about that from banks that day. So it might be that, under some circumstances, banks increase their demand for reserves on days that have high-payment flows. Also, on some high-payment flow days, banks end up with unexpected surpluses of reserves. And what we know from the survey is that banks are not willing to lend those reserves to other banks in the interbank market, and we think of that as distributional frictions. I think we had a sense before that there were distributional frictions that we couldn’t measure, and we talked about that a few times. I think what we found is that they are quite large, and the willingness of banks to give up these surplus reserves above the governance minimum is actually quite low, whereas we thought, in some environments, they may have been willing to relax those distributional frictions that may result in a higher level of reserves being needed.","Conference Call","Press Conf","MS.

"2019-10-04","Just getting back to the Chair’s question, we’re using this “organic growth of the balance sheet” term pretty loosely. Can you just—what are we talking about? Is this trend growth in currency? Are you really thinking about compensating for all shocks to nonreserve liabilities and keeping that kind of smooth? It just seems important for this question about how much we’re going to be intervening.","Conference Call","Press Conf","MS. BRAINARD","65","2019-10"
"2019-10-04","So the way we were framing the discussion about “organic growth” is meant to be the average trend growth in all of the Federal Reserve’s liabilities—which would include some trend growth in reserves as well. And so, on average, over the course of a year, I used the number of $20 billion per month. Of course, that would depend importantly on the forecast of that trend growth, but something in that order of magnitude. Those purchases, depending on the level of buffer that the Committee decided to hold above this minimum level of reserves—that average pace might differ. So, for example, if there was a lower level of buffer above this minimum level of reserves, then that $20 billion per month might be quite volatile over the course of the year to maintain reserves above that level. It would still average that over the course of the year, but some months those purchases may be larger, and other months those purchases may be smaller. If the Committee were to decide to maintain a larger buffer over the minimum, then those average purchases would be more consistent across months over the course of the year.

"2019-10-04","Well, I did have one more question. I don’t mean to get ahead of anything, but we did have the options for communications items laid out.

I think, Chair Powell, that you’re going to be speaking at the National Association of Business Economists (NABE) convention next week on Tuesday.

"2019-10-04","Yes. No, it does, to some extent, depend on what we decide today. I am planning on getting that question, and I’ll have to have a good answer. If we come to a broad consensus on what to do and also agree that we might move to do that next week at a meeting, then I think it would be a good time to maybe lean a little bit forward and foreshadow that. And I would expect Vice Chair Williams to do the same, as the head of the New York Fed. So that was the thought. If we’re not there, then I’ll certainly play off what we agree to and discuss today. In a sense, if we are going to make an intermeeting announcement, it would be good to telegraph it a little bit, I think, just to sort of take some of the buzz off that so that it doesn’t seem completely out of the blue if the market already has a sense of what we’re doing. If that’s where we’re going. Again, I haven’t decided that yet. Any more questions?","Conference Call","Press Conf","CHAIR POWELL","183","2019-10"
"2019-10-04","Okay. Thank you. Any other questions? President Daly. these things to smooth us through—and I’m not against it—are we taking away, in your estimation, any chance that the market can create some more financial resiliency by doing better about intermediating with each other? Or are these just fixed, hard things that you have discovered that aren’t changing? And I just don’t know where you are on that.","Conference Call","Press Conf","CHAIR POWELL","67","2019-10"
"2019-10-04","I think it’s important to look back over the course of the year as the level of reserves has been declining. We have seen banks with surplus reserves lending those into the repo market. So some of the changes that we’ve been seeing and the correlation between movements and repo and unsecured have been because banks have been lending more or less of some of that surplus into the repo market based on price movements. There is some distribution that’s taking place. That distribution tends to take place more in the repo market, as Patricia discussed, and less in the interbank unsecured market than it did pre-crisis because of the regulatory frictions associated with the cost of balance sheet for those two types of transactions. That said, not all banks lend in repo, and so I think if we were going to see an enhancement in that distributional process, some banks that don’t currently do that type of transaction would have to begin to do that, and that’s not part of their business model today. That’s particularly true for some of the large domestic banks outside the SIFIs and also with regional banks as well. And it’s unclear what type of price that would require for them to change that business activity and over what length of time.","Conference Call","Press Conf","MS. LOGAN","218","2019-10"
"2019-10-04","Other questions? [No response] I don’t see any hands waving. All right. Let’s begin our opportunity to comment, beginning with Vice Chair Williams. with Thomas there—efforts to analyze and distill a lot of information from supervision, from our market outreach with our economists, to really come to an understanding, as best as we can, of the events in the past few weeks and to come up with policy interventions that I think have been very effective, at least in the past few weeks, at stabilizing conditions in money markets and, obviously most importantly, keeping the federal funds rate well within the range. In thinking about the topic for today and for our next meetings, I do think it’s important to start from the decision that the FOMC made, in January and then in following meetings, about having an ample-reserves operational framework. I think this is the right decision. This is the decision that, you know, we discussed at length. And we also discussed, as part of that, a plan to monitor, analyze, and assess at what point we think the level of reserves is at a level appropriate to carry out, on a sustained basis, this ample-reserves framework. And the way I think about this—and this gets back to President Evans’s comment and questions and President Rosengren’s, too—is by asking: Is it an ample-reserves regime? We are not doing regular or frequent open market operations. So that’s just, I think, the way we’ve understood it, and that’s what success will look like in the medium term. In light of the events of the past few weeks, I think that it’s really important to—the points that both Patricia and Lorie made, that we’ve actually been watching for many months an evolution in the behavior in these markets. We’ve seen the funds rate spread to the IOER rate rising gradually as the level of reserves has gone down. We’ve seen issues in terms of the spread of interest rates, and now we’ve seen, as of mid-September, just a lot more sensitivity of the repo rates and the federal funds rates to shifts in the underlying payments and demand for reserves. defensive mode. So instead of lending into that market, we saw a lot of pulling back from that and therefore, I think, amplifying some of the movements in repo rates and funding rates. And we’ve seen, as we’ve been doing regular open market operations and we did the term operations that were at quarter-end, that that concern about “I know I have funding today, but what about tomorrow and what about next week and what about quarter-end?” has damped down, and we’ve seen that be successful. We’re looking at all of these indicators over the past six months or so and especially the evidence from the past few weeks. It’s clear that we are close to, or around, a level of reserves in the system that will support an ample-reserves framework. I will just note something. You know, we talked about, why early September? How to think about that is that we were running around $1.45 trillion to $1.5 trillion in that period, and then, as we saw the reserves come down, that’s when the stress really did become amplified. As we’ve brought in up to $150 billion to $200 billion into reserves, as you can see in this chart, we did bring the total quantity of reserves, including open market operations, back up to that level, and markets seemed to be functioning. So that’s another data point that, at least over the next several months, this level seems to support well-functioning money markets. So in terms of how I’m approaching these issues, I’m thinking about the medium-term goal of getting to a sustained ample-reserves regime. If we were in a world in which everything was growing very smoothly, that would just entail growth, this organic growth, in reserve balances. But as you see in figure 7, you know, you look at the gray part of figure 7—without actions, the amount of reserves in the system, due to some seasonal and other factors, will level of reserves—we will actually see reserves decline quite a bit. If you wonder what picture keeps me up at night, it is this picture—it’s about the need to take action relatively soon, in order to keep reserves ample on a sustained basis. Again, I think about this longer-term or medium-term strategy. It does consist of both a transition to get through the year-end and a longer-term sustained level of reserves, and the way we talked about it such that the amount of total reserves in the system doesn’t dip below this current level very often. And then I think about OMOs, whether it’s a standing facility or however we operate, thinking about next April or May and on—those are only there as a backstop for quarter-ends or other days when big payment shocks cause there to be some stress in the market. Again, going back to President Rosengren’s comment, a successful ample- reserves system is one in which we are not doing frequent open market operations actively, and perhaps with some kind of backstop there just to provide that support. Again, I think an important point is what we’ve learned—and Lorie made this point very clearly—is that bank reserves are not perfect substitutes with open market operations. Open market operations, whether term or overnight, especially at scale, do not pass through directly through the financial system fully and, therefore, I think, have some important limitations, as we think about the long-run or medium-term strategy. In terms of the transition, I do think that we do need to get through the end of the year with interest rate control. That is an important part for the FOMC and for monetary policy. So we do need to have, as we transition through the next several months, a combination of purchases and a building-up of the bank reserves over a period of many months so that we have To get us through that period, given this decline in reserves, I think a combination of overnight and term repos will be there to supply reserves into the system to support the FOMC’s directive for the federal funds rate to be in the target range. I do think we need to have both of these pieces, because the long run requires us to get bank reserves higher, but to get through the next few months, we’re going to need repos to support that. And, again, I think there is a matter of needing to move quickly because we need to get the level of bank reserves higher, in order to have confidence that we have good control of the federal funds rate. In terms of delay, it just means that you have to do more per month. On the communications issue, I think it’s really important that this is not about the stance of monetary policy. This is really about the execution of monetary policy. We’ve already described our ample-reserves regime. We’re told everybody that we would be monitoring and analyzing and coming into a view, and when we got to that view, that we’re maintaining those level reserves. And so it’s really about executing on a plan that’s out there. I do think we have to avoid any perception that this is a restart of quantitative easing or of “asset purchases for monetary policy,” from the point of view of monetary policy stance. So there are some pretty strong advantages associated with gradually, initially, building the level of reserves up in such a way that we maintain the level of reserves. I think buying Treasury bills—T-bills, or potentially shorter-term Treasury securities, or both—can make that point clearly. The other thing that I, again, think is important is that we’re really trying to lay out this medium-term strategy. We are laying out a strategy about how to get through April, and that’s, I think, kind of the context of all of this. Then there’s the issue that we have to do about how do they’re already kind of thinking that that’s what we need to do, under our ample-reserves regime. I do think there are some advantages in providing greater clarity that that’s what our approach is over the next six, seven months. I think that what we’ve learned also is that with year-end coming, having that clarity and understanding in the marketplace earlier reduces some of this worry and stress around what’s going to happen at year-end and some of that behavior. I also think it’s important that we have this flexibility in our approach. One of the things that’s come up a lot is, you know, we don’t have all the answers about why things happened. There’s ambiguity about the appropriate level of reserves. There’s going to be continued learning, continuing analysis as we move forward. And so from my point of view, success right now is laying out an overarching strategy of how we plan to get through April, what success looks like. Thinking about April, how we get from here to there, but also having that flexibility that as things evolve, how are we going to adjust our decisions and plans about that. And I do think, from the point of view of market communications, that, right now, markets are not focused on us making a decision anytime soon. They are thinking we’re waiting until October. But I will assure you that between now and the October meeting, the amount of chatter and comments and articles and people talking about “What’s the Fed going to do—they need to have a plan, they don’t have a plan”—it’s just going to rise and rise. So even though they may be saying they’re not expecting anything until October, I think there’s just going to be a lot of uncertainty and debate out there. And if we’re silent on this and we’re not expressing our own strategy and plans ahead of that, I think that that could also be somewhat disruptive.

There is much broader interest in something that we probably ideally should be doing in the background. The second concern I have on the reputational effects is, there are a lot of misleading articles, frequently by people who don’t quite understand what’s happening in the money markets. But they’re making associations to the financial crisis or to other kinds of disruptive economic concerns, and I think that’s really problematic at a time when there’s a fair amount of uncertainty about the outlook. So those reputational concerns are something that I think we ought to think about, in terms of both the urgency and speed with which we address what’s been happening in the money markets. My own preference would be to have an abundant-reserves regime rather than an ample- reserves regime. I know I have lost this debate, but I think we’ve learned the costs are actually larger than I might have thought, and I think this is the appropriate time to think that maybe there’s little cause for taking out more insurance against the volatility we’ve recently seen. And given that these reputational risks seem a little bit greater, I’d prefer not to be so close to the upward-sloping part of the demand for reserves. options, that would be my preferred option. However, my preference would be to be bolder. As the memo highlighted, there are going to be more downdrafts and reserves next year. I’d prefer to announce a technical adjustment relatively soon—involving a larger expansion of our balance sheet, possibly including notes and bonds, in light of some of the Q&A that just occurred, in addition to more quickly increasing the bill purchases. This would more quickly get away from the need for term repurchase agreements and have us better situated for lower reserve balances next year.

"2019-10-04","I am. There you go. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Maybe it was better when I was on mute. [Laughter] Although I share the immediate concerns for our money markets, I would like to briefly start by posing two fundamental questions that go beyond the recent developments. First, I think we need to ask ourselves if the existing regulations or supervision explicitly or implicitly favor reserves over other high-quality liquid assets and are interfering with market functioning. The second question is whether the federal funds rate remains the best choice for our policy target, given that the unsecured lending market is decidedly thin compared to the repo market. Now, these questions are not on the agenda today, but I believe we should revisit them and other fundamental issues in the near future. Regarding the pressing operational matters, I believe we should take action as soon as possible to keep the level of reserves somewhat north of $1.4 trillion through the end of the year. I suspect that a lower level of reserves could still be compatible with an ample-reserves regime. All that said, there is little to gain by letting reserves decline further at this point and much more to lose if we struggle with interest rate control. With regard to the questions of how to stabilize reserves, I have a preference toward outright purchases of Treasury bills in the faster- purchases scenario, effectively restarting the organic growth of the balance sheet. To avoid impairing markets, the right mix should also include term repo operations as well as overnight repo operations as a backstop for rate control. So, like many things in life, “Timing is everything,” as they say. Let me turn to the question of whether to announce our actions before the October FOMC meeting. I actually see both pros and cons to this. In light of the large shortfall of reserves projected by year-end in the absence of actions, an early start to purchases would be helpful and allow a smoother and slower pace. Yet moving early may surprise markets—which could, in turn, lead market participants to believe that there are broader concerns about financial stability or liquidity. For me, the tiebreaker is the ever-present risk that our actions may be misperceived as a change in our policy stance. The silver lining—if there is a silver lining in the September episode—is that this has actually made our communications, in my mind, a bit easier, giving us a real-life illustration of the kind of episode that we aim to avoid by restarting the organic growth of the balance sheet. That said, we cannot be too cautious. A decision today and an announcement shortly thereafter would put further distance between implementation decisions and the stance of monetary policy, particularly because we cannot discount the possibility of a rate cut in October. Thus, I favor taking immediate action. policy stance. So I’d like to save our occasional disagreements for monetary policy but strive in this case to try to send a unified message. Thank you, Mr. Chair.","Conference Call","Press Conf","MR. HARKER","505","2019-10"
"2019-10-04","Thank you, Mr. Chair. So I’ll join what I’m sure will be a tsunami of thanks to the staff for the quick and clear analysis of recent repo market developments. I know how much work that has been and, particularly, the time constraints that it has been done under. So much more is clear than was clear two weeks ago, although there is still a bunch that remains unclear. But my current view is that the recent spike in rates is primarily indicative, as President Harker was suggesting, of structural features in our regulatory framework that have introduced rigidities into the system’s ability to allocate reserves across institutions. In the absence of those regulatory and supervisory incentives and disincentives, which we have introduced into the system, my current hypothesis on the basis of what we’re hearing is that the current overall level of reserves would be abundant—should be more than abundant, or ample, or whatever the correct word is—and I view the problem as one of allocation rather than scarcity. Now, directing those incentives would be a midterm project, and we have a short-term problem. And today’s discussion is to focus on handling the short-term issue. I don’t want to distract us from that. On top of that, the regulatory and supervisory issues that I think are in question are matters for the Board rather than the Committee. That’s why I mention that point whenever raising regulatory issues in an FOMC meeting. But I do think that my particular contribution to this discussion is at least to lay out how I see those issues having contributed to So what’s the source of the allocation problem? Banks have told us—and the largest banks have particularly emphasized this—that they feel under supervisory pressure for reserves over short-term Treasury securities in satisfying their liquidity requirements in a post-crisis framework. Now, as most of you know, they cited other regulatory incentives as well that are related to the leverage ratio and the calculation of the G-SIB surcharge. I think these latter two are much less likely to have been particularly relevant to the events of September, but I do think that the unwillingness of the large banks to part with reserves at any price in September is showing us that we need to address those incentives that are biasing some banks to hold reserves over Treasury securities. And, again, just to review for everyone, the consequences of the current liquidity measures come from two principal elements: the Liquidity Coverage Ratio and the internal liquidity stress tests that we require banks to run. The Liquidity Coverage Ratio— again, as almost all of you know but maybe not all of you have at the top of your head— establishes a minimum that firms have to comply with. It’s based on standardized definitions and outflow rates. And under the Liquidity Coverage Ratio, the actual regulation—there’s no difference between reserves and Treasury securities. It is indifferent. The stress tests are not, necessarily. In 2018, for example, our supervisors conducted an internal liquidity stress-test buffer monetization exam, looking at how the firms were assigning appropriate monetization haircuts to highly liquid securities in the event of stress. And there are differences in the speed and ease of monetization of Treasury securities and reserves, and that will show up in the banks’ internal liquidity stress test. fair bit of time since mid-September on the phone with my counterparts at the Bank of England and ECB, who were quite direct about that. And, interestingly, the ECB, for example, has a much lower level of long-term demand for reserves, as I’ve mentioned in the Committee before—close to $400 billion relative to what, in our case, had been, at one point, $2 trillion and now $1.45 trillion or higher. Now, a standing repo facility would be important in conjunction with this, and I’m looking forward to our discussion at the October meeting. Part of the concern with these internal liquidity stress tests is that there is a difference between the monetizability of reserves and Treasury securities and stress—it’s not huge, but it is there. And a standing repo facility—or at least the Platonic ideal of such a facility—would dramatically reduce or eliminate such a difference and, therefore, reduce or eliminate the different treatment of reserves and Treasury securities in banks’ liquidity stress tests. The ECB, for example, has a facility through which the central bank monetizes nonreserve high-quality liquid assets, and this is likely to be a factor in their much lower long-term level of reserves demand—although negative interest rates are also a strong contributor, obviously. So such a facility would be helpful in handling periods of stress, but it would also likely lower the overall demand for reserves by guaranteeing the convertibility of Treasury securities. We have been told by","Conference Call","Press Conf","MR. QUARLES","797","2019-10"
"2019-10-04","banks that this would likely be the case and, therefore, would have made the events in September much less likely had it all been in place by then. But we do not yet have really the rough quantification of the size of this effect, and the details around such a facility would be complex. Much remains to be worked out. So recognizing that we either use effect on the demand for reserves would be even if we do implement these measures, and we have to have a plan to cover the near term. That will likely require, in addition to the current levels of reserves, whether and to what extent these structural rigidities can be addressed. So I now turn to the topic for today—the potential plans for expanding the balance sheet detailed in the staff memo. Principally because I view this as an allocation rather than a level problem, if we were to grow the balance sheet, I’d like to do that in a way most likely not to confuse our actions with a renewal of QE. There are fraught communications issues in resuming balance sheet growth at this point and seemingly under duress. I prefer buying bills in order to have the least effect on the market for duration. My preference would be for smaller interventions. I’d like to keep the amount as close to the organic growth of currency demand as possible, but I do recognize that “as close as possible” may, in fact, be quite a significant addition to reserves in the near term, in order to address this short-term issue. As we think about how all of this will evolve over the longer term, I think we should keep in mind the potential effects of our ability to address these incentives. Thank you, Mr. Chair.","Conference Call","Press Conf","U.S","300","2019-10"
"2019-10-04","I’m sorry—I thought I was in the order last. I’m ready to go, though. I’m supportive of announcing in advance of our next scheduled meeting, frankly, that we intend to rebuild and maintain reserves at or moderately above levels prevailing earlier this year. This would provide assurance to market participants—and to the public more generally, to the Like Vice Chair Williams, I would like to remain flexible and focus on our goals of interest rate control and providing ample reserves in order to execute on that. I worry if we provide too much detail—although Thomas and Lorie convinced me of September having some benefits, too much detail, I think, could signal too much confidence in the quantity when we’re actually not sure about that. We have a lot of uncertainty, and we’re going to continue to learn. What we’re really sure about is that we want the funds rate to trade within the range, and the rest of it is something we’re going to learn about. So I lean toward fewer details—as few as would reasonable—and more framework and commitment. Now, in terms of the two options presented in the staff memo, I’m in favor of using purchases of Treasury bills as the primary tool for ensuring an ample supply of reserves. I tend to favor the approach of a faster pace of bill purchases. Indeed, much like President Rosengren, I would like to even consider an alternative strategy that front-loads these purchases, taking the opportunity of making a technical adjustment because there’s so much emphasis right now on the disruptions in the repo market and perhaps make some immediate larger purchases to the extent that the market can withstand it in order to get us back up to a level that’s more comfortable. We could then allow the balance sheet to grow more organically as we learn about the desired level of reserves and whether to use a standing repo facility. And here I support the idea that has been discussed by many that the standing repo facility, even if we have it, should be something we occasionally use. My understanding of an ample-reserves regime is we rarely need to go to that—only for payment shocks. Desk announcement. Like Thomas indicated, this seems like a sizable decision—and one that we should take ownership of. Importantly, I think we can take control of the narrative. Right now, the narrative is being written for us. And it’s often not very positive, as President Rosengren mentioned. The opportunity for us to go in and say, “This is not QE, this is really the plumbing, this is a technical adjustment. We’re committed to having the funds rate trade within the range we’ve stated”—I think those are things that, if we have unified talking points, we can absolutely accomplish. I’m not just optimistic. I’ve actually been in situations like many of you—more than I’d like to be, really—of being asked these questions by my board of directors, by outside participants, many of whom are involved in markets. And when you go through the details and explain the framework and explain what we’re doing, then they get it. And I think this is enhanced by being at the short end, using bills and not longer-duration purchases. That really kind of tells them that this is not QE, it’s really technical adjustments. So I believe that we can do this. I would like to see us do it earlier, so that we don’t confuse distinct things. It’s just another opportunity not to confuse the stance of monetary policy with the plumbing or the execution of policy. So with that I would say, thank you, Mr. Chair.","Conference Call","Press Conf","MS. DALY","610","2019-10"
"2019-10-04","Thank you, Mr. Chair. I want to thank New York and the Board for all the hard work. This is an area in which helping educate us all on the details of money markets and how they behave and new development here is really important. So I appreciate all of that. channel of our monetary policy transmission mechanism is directly through credit intermediation that supports our growth and inflation mandates. The Committee’s recent actions to cut rates have worked to recalibrate our policy setting to a more accommodative setting of the federal funds rate. Unexpected financial volatility in money markets that’s symptomatic of weaker, poor market functioning increases the cost of credit intermediation. Unintended additional volatility may frustrate our recent policy actions. So making adjustments to our programs here—that’s not monetary policy, but it is important for monetary policy. This is likely to be a challenging issue, as our preference for pointing to the setting of administered rates, like the IOER rate and the ON RRP rate, will likely be less powerful alone. That is, as the IOER rate is reduced further within the funds rate target range, the market’s determination of the federal funds rate is becoming less about arbitraging administered spreads to the IOER and ON RRP rates, and it’s more about arbitraging spreads to money market rates, which we don’t control directly. And I think the size of reserves in the system probably influences which arbitrage is going to be most prevalent. So that’s why that’s going to be important for us. This tells me that our earlier, better experience when we had a clearly ample quantity of reserves was important. We haven’t defined “ample” precisely—but the recent market disruptions are clear evidence that reserves have fallen below “ample.” So the question now is, what’s the best way to get back to an appropriate level? And I think Governor Brainard’s question about—we’re talking about organic growth a lot. What do we really mean by that? I agree with Lorie’s response that there are trend factors that we’re other nonreserve liabilities are evolving. So there’s going to be a lot going on, and we shouldn’t be surprised if we have to revisit moments like this. I doubt that organic growth is going to be the easy type of in-the-background assessment that we would all like. Second, we obviously need to implement a near-term fix in order to keep money markets best aligned with our policy setting. But we also need a longer-term plan for how we will maintain an ample-reserves regime over time. It seems clear to me that such a plan will include Treasury security purchases. Near-term issues aside, over the longer term, we will need to grow our balance sheet to keep up with organic growth in currency and other nonreserve liabilities. We will do this by buying Treasury securities, just as we always have. So we should coalesce around a long-term implementation plan that includes regular asset purchases. It makes sense to rely on Treasury bill purchases now as much as possible to address the immediate problem of our current reserves shortfall. As I understand our risks and policy objectives, I favor emphasizing bill purchases to add the majority, or lion’s share, of the new reserves and using a combination of daily and term repos to fill in the market-functioning details. So I think that the $60 billion per month T-bills proposal is better than the $30 billion per month proposal. I agree with the Daly–Rosengren proposal so far, about making a one-time program of additional purchases of some size to close the gap sooner would be helpful. Now, I recognize that some have worried that outright bill purchases may be misconstrued as a new round of quantitative easing. I think that’s a communications issue that can be dealt with quite adequately by the Chair and supporting commentary coming from all of us and also publication of the implementation details. Basically, with quantitative easing, hands of the private sector. It’s really all about duration, I would say, for anybody who’s paying attention to what the actual thrust is of QE purchases we’re supposed to be doing. Short-term bill purchases will not add to duration meaningfully, and this just really becomes a communications task. Third, there’s undoubtedly much to learn about financial stability from the past few weeks, and we’ve already heard commentary by President Harker and Governor Quarles about the implications of regulatory policy—supervisory interpretation of things that are interesting and we should digest better. One lesson that’s been driven home for me is the value of ample reserves and facilitating the intermediation process and in preventing an amplification of market volatility. The ample-reserves regime has proven its ability to prevent small shocks from turning into big problems. One conclusion I drew from the memo is that there’s a good chance that the early September tax payments and Treasury security issuance would not have even shown up on our radar screens if reserves had been higher—say, at the level of just a few months ago. Indeed, an implementation regime that can handle these kinds of shocks seems to be exactly what the Federal Reserve Act had in mind when it told us to furnish an elastic currency. I’m uncomfortable with communicating a message that our balance sheet goal is merely reserves at the level of early September. We need to make sure that we’ve got a large margin for error, and that’s why I asked about other assessments of what those numbers might be. Some of those numbers were larger, and some were smaller. So we need a larger margin for error. I don’t know what that number should be. I’d err on the side of making sure we had plenty. The It’s certainly the case that regulatory adjustments for some of the largest banks that are worried about the Liquidity Coverage Ratio and the supervisory implications could be an important aspect to that. But I go back to what we were thinking about when we said, “We want an ample balance sheet, and we’re focused on efficiency.” Efficiency always sounds like an excellent idea. and I’m an economist, so I certainly subscribe to—we like efficient outcomes. But in this context, it always struck me that efficiency was more about “optics” and people criticizing the Federal Reserve for having a profligate size of the balance sheet. We’ve already sort of incurred some costs for wanting a somewhat lower-sized balance sheet, and if we go the route of just adjusting regulatory policy somewhat, hoping that that will help us, I think that that’s got quite a lot of risk. I would describe that as a risky strategy, myself. Lastly, I agree with the suggestions that we should communicate earlier. I asked about the NABE speech. I would be completely comfortable with the Chair taking the lead early on describing all of the issues that are in front of us and providing some indication of what the Committee action is likely to be. Bolder is safer, I think, for our monetary policy and the objectives that we have. Thank you, Mr. Chair.","Conference Call","Press Conf","MR. EVANS","1185","2019-10"
"2019-10-04","Thank you, Chair Powell. It is customary to thank the staff, but thanks are especially warranted this time. And also, special thanks to Vice Chair Williams, who has led the effort and brought us to a good set of notes and materials for discussing this. So let me just chime in. I’m broadly supportive of the outlines of the effort that have been outlined in the memos that would combine a resumption of bill purchases with the operations as well. I’m also sympathetic—and, indeed, think, for communications purposes, that the artful approach here is useful to us—to put in the language with reference to the September level of reserves but also indicating that we would probably want a cushion above that, but to leave that with a degree of ambiguity to give us the ability to be flexible there. The reason why I like that approach to communications is that we announced in July that we were bringing the process of balance sheet reduction to an end, and we also indicated that we would be learning about the appropriate point and that we would resume purchases. And putting this in September and achieving that level, I think, provides us with a bridge between the July decision and what will be the October decision. I agree with Presidents Daly and Evans and others and, I think, President Harker. I would certainly strongly urge that we do this before the October meeting. I think that would serve a couple of purposes. It would serve the purpose of distinguishing between an ambitious but ultimately a technical action in the functioning of the markets from a policy decision. Literally, there would be time between those two announcements. Also, we’ll have important issues to discuss in October. It would give us more time to do that. So I am very enthusiastic about doing that before the next meeting. In terms of preference for the details, again, the broad plan, I think, is a good one. I would have a preference for something similar to option 8 on exhibit 2, but with the addition— that I think both Presidents Rosengren and Daly mentioned—that, instead of having a constant amount of purchases over the window, would think of some months where there would be some bunching of purchases at very high levels. My preference would be to put that in December, through outright purchases. Again, I think we’d need to keep the term repos in place, but as opposed to, say, doing $60 billion a month continuously, do a somewhat smaller—perhaps much smaller—number in most months and then really loading in big purchases if that were technically possible. Let me conclude with a couple of longer-term thoughts. Again, I know our interest is the near term, but I do think I’d like to provide some context on some points that Governor Quarles mentioned. I do think we’re going to end up, at some point, with a standing repo facility. I think that can be potentially helpful in a lot of dimensions that we’ve discussed. I know that’s not on the table today, but certainly my own view is that it’s going to have to be an element of a longer- term solution. One thing that I did pick up in my conversations that we had with the Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee (TBAC) crowd when they were at the Board last week is that it will be important to get the details and the way we communicate a standing repo facility, right? If we really want this to be a facility that we use as a substitute for having high reserve levels, then they need to know that they are able to use it in size. We’d have to think about the pricing, we’d have to think about the spread and all of that. But, again, I think that’s where we’re going to end up, and I think that’s an important part of the longer-term resolution here. Let me perhaps offer a cautionary note on the issue of the funds rate versus the repo market. Clearly, the repo market is much more important than the funds market now, and the funds market is a different funds market than it was before the crisis. But that being said, I would urge that we give a longer-term and really serious discussion over time to moving primary reason is that the repo market is much larger. I had my staff print a chart of the daily spread between general collateral (GC) repo, and the funds rate going back 45 years. That spread moves around all the time. You can have a well-functioning, growing, healthy economy in the ’90s with the repo and the funds rate spread moving around. And there are some reasons why that spread moves around. The art to doing this is we don’t want a replay. The move in this spread on September 17 was the largest spread in the history of the data set going back 45 years times 250 days a year. So, yes, you don’t want those moves. But on the other hand, I would be nervous about publicly committing us to the repo rate being plus or minus 1 basis point. So we would have to be careful if we moved down that road. I’m not saying we are moving down that road, but that would be a consideration. And then, finally, and I’ll close on this, the staff has offered some good ideas about bridging between now and April on what we call the temporary open market operations. At least one thing I’d put on the table is perhaps keying the decision to do those operations to where the funds rate itself trades. So, for example, on a day when the funds rate is within 1 or 2 or whatever basis points of the top of the range, we might announce an operation. And then that would make it clear that, at least now, this is about controlling the funds rate. This is about keeping the funds rate in the range. And, again, there may be problems with that, but it’s at least something to think about down the road when we’re talking about the detailed design of the temporary operations. But, again, I do think this is going to be a necessary step. I like the idea of bridging between the July decision and what we would be announcing, and I very much like the idea of doing it before our October 30 meeting.

"2019-10-04","Thanks. Like others, I agree with the notion of bolstering reserve balances. The story I would tell is, we said we would gradually shrink the balance sheet and learn where the point of scarcity might be. We seem to have found it. We’re not bothered by the fact that it was somewhat earlier than we might have thought. “Excess reserves” in practice were just less than we had analyzed, and we’ve learned from that. I do worry that a message of $60 billion a month will be misinterpreted as a return to QE, as it does appear comparably scaled. Our communication needs to emphasize that this is about liabilities, not about assets. It’s a reserves-maintenance program, not a balance sheet expansion. In line with the options presented in the communication, I would just communicate the point that we will maintain reserves at a minimum level, perhaps consistent with early September, and to do that we will conduct a limited-time technical adjustment as necessary. I also worry that we, and the media, overfocus on volatility. Some volatility is inevitable. Perhaps echoing Governor Clarida: From 2000 to 2006, for example, we had 30 days on which the effective federal funds rate was plus or minus 25 basis points away from target. So I believe expecting zero volatility is not a sensible platform. Instead, I’m very supportive of a strategy that lowers the cost of volatility when it inevitably happens, and the right repo facility has the potential to do that. swings from the Treasury’s General Account.

"2019-10-04","Thank you, Mr. Chair. I’m generally supportive of Desk recommendations on these issues to carry us through the current quarter and over year-end into the first quarter of 2020. But I do think that this has an ad hoc feel to it. And because of that, I think it requires careful management, especially around the quantitative easing issues as just articulated by President Barkin. Like others, I think a standing repo facility would greatly mitigate many of the key issues that we face. There does appear to be a preference in markets for reserves to meet regulatory requirements concerning liquidity, such as the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR), and I agree with President Harker and Governor Quarles on this issue. Governor Clarida also brought this up. I think this is a very important source of distributional issues within this market, and one that could be mitigated greatly by a standing repo facility. Another issue that we face is that we don’t want the federal funds rate trading above the upper end of the range, but repo would remove this. A standing repo facility would fix this. And also, we would meet an international standard. Other central banks operate with a repo facility and a reverse repo facility. So I think we could definitely go in this direction over the medium term, and I know we’ll have an opportunity to discuss this more at our upcoming meeting. One thing about a facility is that reserves could potentially be lower because of expectations effects—that is, knowing that the facility is there, knowing that it’s credible, and development, because it would give the Committee more policy space should we eventually want to return to true quantitative easing at some point in the future in reaction to a particularly negative shock to the","Conference Call","Press Conf","MR.

I would also concur with others that we should announce before the October FOMC meeting in order to separate this decision from the policy decisions that could be made at the October meeting. I think it might muddle our message in October, no matter what way the Committee goes, if we try to announce this at the same time. So I think that, by announcing sooner, we have a better chance of keeping this as a technical adjustment sort of feel to it, and we have a better chance of addressing the idea that this is not a return to quantitative easing in the United States despite the return to quantitative easing in Europe.

"2019-10-04","All right. Sorry about that. I got cut off for a moment. So I agree with the objectives as stated of returning to a sustainable level of ample reserves, and I think the other objective I would have in assessing these options is erring on the side of preempting volatility in the future versus reacting to it. I think, in that regard, I prefer the faster approach as outlined, the of short coupon securities, if that’s our judgment of what the market could tolerate, I would also be supportive of that. I would not be supportive, though, of going further than that, or I would be buying bonds. In terms of the public’s perception, I don’t personally think that if we’re buying bills and only short coupon securities, I don’t know that the public is going to be able to see much difference between $30 billion and $60 billion a month or even $60 billion and $80 billion a month, and so I would rather back a solution that is more likely to address this issue and preempt future volatility. So I would want to give the staff latitude to do that. Obviously, the communication is going to have to emphasize that this is not QE, that it’s a technical adjustment, but I actually believe we’ll be able to do that. And I like bill purchases and relying more heavily on those, for all the reasons others have said because it’s much more likely to spread reserves through the system. In terms of the announcement, I would strongly favor doing an announcement well before the FOMC meeting, as others have suggested. I think that would de-link it from monetary policy. It’s more consistent with it being a technical adjustment, and it allows us also to start making purchases sooner. I’m glad that Governor Quarles is talking about looking at the regulatory incentives for owning reserves versus Treasury securities, and I think, in the longer run, that would be a good exercise to do. It obviously doesn’t address this situation now. Lastly, as many have said, I think we would be very well served to get this issue off the table. I notice in my own meetings with the public that they are starting to raise broader concerns about liquidity at a time when the economic outlook is more uncertain and we’re more actions, again, that err on the side of preempting future volatility and, if necessary, overdoing this a bit rather than underdoing it. Thank you, Mr. Chair.","Conference Call","Press Conf","MR. KAPLAN","418","2019-10"
"2019-10-04","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I’ll be brief here, because I agree with the general consensus—that is, we should begin right away with our purchases of Treasury bills. I think that’s the best short-term solution to getting our level of reserves back up. I also believe, over the longer term, we should clarify what’s happening with some of these structural issues. I think the fact that a liquidity regulation was aimed to enhance market functioning—an important role of intermediation during times of stress—means something isn’t calibrated right there. So I’m glad Governor Quarles has raised that issue as something that needs to be addressed. And then, finally, with our communication, I would announce quickly and act quickly to affirm our operational framework for ample reserves and our objectives of rate control. I think the sooner we do that, we can put many of the questions and issues behind us about whether there are other things going on. And I was concerned about QE-like issues if we emphasize that we are really supporting the decisions that we made earlier. Thank you.","Conference Call","Press Conf","MS. GEORGE","179","2019-10"

I appreciate your suggestion, Jim.","Conference Call","Press Conf","CHAIR POWELL","77","2019-10"
"2019-10-04","Thank you, Mr. Chair. I guess my first question is for Lorie, which piggybacks on Charlie’s question. I just want to make sure that I’m understanding the very basics of this. If I look at the forecast, if we do what you’re proposing but we don’t do anything else, in April you would expect to see rates spike again. Is that fair to say? So we’re buying ourselves four or five months, something like that?","Conference Call","Press Conf","MR. KASHKARI","75","2019-10"
"2019-10-04","That’s right. If you look at panel 7, as I just mentioned, the focus of the memo and the work is on the next three months.","Conference Call","Press Conf","MS. LOGAN","26","2019-10"
"2019-10-04","And during that time the Committee would have more time to discuss the appropriate approach to think about the first quarter of 2020. We wanted to show, though, this longer horizon in the forecast so that you could get a sense of how the decisions being made in the short run would affect that second quarter and into the April period.","Conference Call","Press Conf","MS. LOGAN","61","2019-10"
"2019-10-04","Okay, thank you. So a quick follow-up to that. In previous meetings, I thought the staff was being too conservative in your “buffers on top of your buffers.” Pretty clearly, I was wrong about that. I guess my question here is, if we’re going to do something somewhat extraordinary, do we want now to build in more of a buffer and just make sure that we don’t have any hiccups or surprises, between now and April? And so my question is—and we can talk about it later in the actual go-round—do we need to have more of a buffer if we’re going to do something extraordinary right now than what appears to be in the proposal? So that’s just kind of a comment. policy, we’re talking about the implementation of monetary policy. Is it remotely possible that this could be a Desk communication, which would turn the heat down a little bit and put more focus on “this is just technical details of how we implement policy,” so that there’s less confusion that the FOMC is changing its stance of policy? Thank you.","Conference Call","Press Conf","MR. KASHKARI","183","2019-10"
"2019-10-04","I was looking here at your trusty general counsel. He will have to opine. I think that a very expansive reading of “open market operations” would also include outright expansion of your outright holdings. If you ask me, it feels like this is a sufficiently significant step that it would be surprising and might raise questions about whether this was a unilateral Desk decision that I would see advantages to having a communication that would clarify that, no, this was actually a Committee decision.","Conference Call","Press Conf","MR. LAUBACH","84","2019-10"
"2019-10-04","Thank you, Mr. Chair. So my question, I guess, piggybacks off both President Evans and President Kashkari. Back to this September thing. I don’t want to put too much weight on it, but we do seem to be hovering around “Let’s get it back to September.” But we’ve been—as Patricia briefed us, we started to see some movement, some volatility that might have been a warning sign all the way back in March. And so my question is, really, when we’re communicating about building reserves back up to get through the next several months, do we really need to put a date at which we’re targeting it, or can we learn? Because part of it is, we’re going to discuss, but part of it is, we’re also going to learn about what the appropriate amount of reserves is to operate effectively and I guess, Thomas and Lorie, from your market outreach?","Conference Call","Press Conf","MS. DALY","151","2019-10"
"2019-10-04","I will defer to Lorie in terms of, you know, how market participants might view the early September level as a focal point. It seems to me that what would be helpful is some clarity—you know, what your purchases over the coming months are trying to achieve. So if you just indicated, for example, a monthly pace, that may leave a little more uncertainty as to what you are willing to provide.","Conference Call","Press Conf","MR. LAUBACH","72","2019-10"
"2019-10-04","Thank you, Thomas. I agree with Thomas that providing the sense of early September gives the market a focal point for what we’re trying to achieve over the shorter- run period. I think that would be associated with communications about continued discussion that the Committee would be having on the efficient and effective level of reserves. In terms of market expectations, we haven’t seen a lot, in terms of the level of reserves the Committee would choose to maintain over some longer horizon. We’ve only seen a few market participants give a figure along those lines. I think most of the discussion that we’ve seen in the market is focused on a near-term issue, and there’s a general understanding that the longer- run level of reserves that the Committee would deem to be efficient and effective would be influenced by other policies. And there’s some expectation that there’s going to be discussion of a standing repo facility or other policies that could affect the overall demand for reserves of individual institutions. In my view, the communications about the near term is what the market will focus on, and then, after that, they’ll start making broader predictions or expectations about where the Committee is heading over a period that goes beyond the end of the year.","Conference Call","Press Conf","MS. LOGAN","215","2019-10"
"2019-10-04","So, Lorie, and maybe Thomas, is there a reason that you’re focusing on the date, early September, rather than telling the markets the level you’re doing? Is that because you don’t want to associate a level—because you may change the level later on?","Conference Call","Press Conf","MS. MESTER","43","2019-10"
"2019-10-04","President Evans, if I might just add, from the perspective of communications, you may, therefore, also want to emphasize that this number or the level that","Conference Call","Press Conf","MR. LAUBACH","26","2019-10"
"2019-10-04","I think there was a sense that, from a communications perspective, there was some benefit in focusing on returning to a level before these events took place, but not being so precise at this point. From a market perspective, I think what they will do is look at the H.4.1 numbers from the first and the second week of September, and I think they will begin to communicate that it’s a level of $1.45 trillion based on that information. Really, that’s a communications decision for the Committee and an important discussion point for today.","Conference Call","Press Conf","MS. LOGAN","94","2019-10"
"2019-10-04","Yes, I just want to point out, there’s one issue about this level, just to clarify. When you talk about a level of a certain dollar amount, it sounds like we’re targeting that level, and when you think about using temporary open market operations, you really can’t think about targeting the level of reserves when you’re relying on those open market operations. Because, as we’ve seen, the take-up of those operations depends on the circumstances at that point in time. Even with this plan, we can easily see the amount of reserves, inclusive of the open-market operations, fall below $1.4 trillion. So there’s a communications issue about, really, what we’re trying to do, I would think, is supply a level of reserves into the system and consistent with the level of reserves that we’ve seen in early","Conference Call","Press Conf","VICE CHAIR WILLIAMS","137","2019-10"
"2019-10-04","I think it’s also just worth highlighting the fact—which is important from an operational perspective and in how we would go about implementation—that the goal is to supply sufficient reserves so that you’re consistently above that level. So that’s a minimum level. On average, the amount that we would be supplying would be above that. And then that gets into an earlier question about how big a buffer the Committee would like to have to allow for those changes in nonreserve liabilities that then bring you back down. So, really, this is meant to communicate a minimum level that we would be aiming to supply reserves above.","Conference Call","Press Conf","MS. LOGAN","107","2019-10"
"2019-10-04","Great. Any further questions before we begin our opportunity for—","Conference Call","Press Conf","CHAIR POWELL","10","2019-10"
"2019-10-04","There is. President Rosengren, I see you now.","Conference Call","Press Conf","CHAIR POWELL","8","2019-10"
"2019-10-04","Tom also has a question. I’ll go first. I actually have two questions. The first question gets to the word “efficient.” I was thinking that “efficient amount of reserves” referred to the amount of reserves necessary so that we didn’t have to do overnight or term repos (RPs). And this memo seems to have a different definition of what “efficient” is that somehow allows both term and overnight RPs to go up or down, sometimes by fairly substantial amounts. So it would be useful to get a clearer definition of whether “efficient” means we don’t have to do overnight and term RPs and our balance sheet is sufficiently large that we don’t have to do that, or—what is the alternative definition to what “efficient” means? That’s my first question. And my second question is, if we think “efficient” is actually trying to avoid doing all this intervention by the Markets Group on a more regular basis, how many bills and notes could we buy over a relatively short period to expand our balance sheet so that we don’t have as much purchase of bills, in order to get up to a higher level, what would the quantity be that would start becoming disruptive? Thank you.","Conference Call","Press Conf","MR. ROSENGREN","205","2019-10"
"2019-10-04","I’ll try and do the first one, and, Lorie, maybe you could take the second. The communications that you issued in January actually do not exactly refer to an efficient and effective level, but they, of course, have this important clause that, you would like to be in a position in which active management of the supply of reserves is not required. Arguably, what the Desk is currently doing, with its heroic efforts, is pretty active. And so you can argue that, in fact, you would like your securities holdings to be sufficiently large that operations of this sort should be an exception—and not an ongoing activity.","Conference Call","Press Conf","MR. LAUBACH","107","2019-10"
"2019-10-04","Thank you, Thomas. I think, also, just in terms of the memo itself, our focus was on the transition over these three months and not to define the steady state—which is where Thomas focused in his comments. In terms of the overall size, in the memo we proposed $60 billion of bills per month in the illustrative scenario 1. Based on some analysis that we’ve done looking at changes in the supply of Treasury securities when the Treasury has needed to move the bill supply up and down fairly rapidly, for reasons related to the debt ceiling, we’ve gained some experience about the amount of bill supply in the short run that wouldn’t affect market functioning. Of course, we would learn along the way, but we think to start somewhere around $60 billion, maybe a little bit higher, is where we’d feel comfortable from a market-functioning perspective. short coupon securities or even a little bit further out along the Treasury curve to get to a total of maybe $80 billion per month or a little above $80 billion over a one-month horizon. But I think, from an initial starting place, that’s where we’d feel comfortable from a market-functioning perspective.","Conference Call","Press Conf","MS. LOGAN","199","2019-10"
"2019-10-04","Before we go on to President Barkin, can I just follow up on President Rosengren’s question? Maybe you answered this and I didn’t get it, but—let’s say we’re at the end of April next year, and we have the level of reserves that is shown in the top panel in picture 7, and that we’re growing organically from there. What would be our expectation going forward for the next 12 months, let’s say? Would we then be able to look at the language that Thomas read and believe that we have a level of reserves such that we do not expect to be using open market operations to manage interest rates? Would we be satisfying that language at that time, or would we still be short of it?","Conference Call","Press Conf","CHAIR POWELL","128","2019-10"
"2019-10-04","In terms of the projection that we’re showing through the end of the year, as I mentioned earlier, the amount we’re trying to fill by the end of 2019 was $250 billion. We would need to fill another $100 billion before April 2020. That would be inclusive of thinking about organic growth during that period, but organic growth purchases over the course of a year would probably average around $15 billion to $20 billion per month generally. But, in this first part, there’s an amount that’s needed well above that average organic growth over the course of the year.","Conference Call","Press Conf","MS. LOGAN","99","2019-10"
"2019-10-04","So, with the extra. $100 billion for the April period, and then after that you would grow, on average, whatever we determine to be that organic growth number.","Conference Call","Press Conf","CHAIR POWELL","28","2019-10"
"2019-10-04","My question really is, standing there on April 30 with that amount of reserves, do we believe we’re in an ample-reserves regime, as we have defined it? Or do we believe that we’ll still need to be doing intermittent repo and things?","Conference Call","Press Conf","CHAIR POWELL","42","2019-10"
"2019-10-04","I think the focus that this projection is based on is the idea of limiting volatility over this short-run period: targeting a minimum level of reserves from early September plus the overnight operations. The longer-run level of reserves, such that you are relying purely on purchases, would likely be higher, but would importantly depend on the Committee’s discussions about whether to maintain a standing repo facility or to take other actions to reduce nonreserve liabilities or changes in policy related to the demand for reserves. I think that question would need to be in the context of those longer-term questions.","Conference Call","Press Conf","MS. LOGAN","100","2019-10"

"2019-10-04","Can I just make one suggestion in that regard?

"2019-10-08","Today a higher oil price would still cause dislocations and hardship for many, but with exports and imports nearly balanced, the higher price paid by consumers is roughly offset by higher earnings of workers and firms in the U.S. oil industry.","General","Speech","N/A","41","2019-10"
"2019-10-08","Moreover, because it is now easier to ramp up oil production, a sustained price rise can quickly boost output, providing a shock absorber in the face of supply disruptions.","General","Speech","N/A","29","2019-10"

"2019-10-08","""6In the second half of the 1990s, this measurement puzzle was at the heart of monetary policymaking.7Chairman Alan Greenspan famously argued that the United States was experiencing the dawn of a new economy, and that potential and actual output were likely understated in official statistics.","General","Speech","N/A","45","2019-10"
"2019-10-08","Where others saw capacity constraints and incipient inflation, Greenspan saw a productivity boom that would leave room for very low unemployment without inflation pressures.","General","Speech","N/A","24","2019-10"

"2019-10-08","Official statistics currently show productivity growth slowing significantly in recent years, with the growth in output per hour worked falling from more than 3 percent a year from 1995 to 2003 to less than half that pace since then.9Analysts are actively debating three alternative explanations for this apparent slowdown: First, the slowdown may be real and may persist indefinitely as productivity growth returns to more‑normal levels after a brief golden age.10Second, the slowdown may instead be a pause of the sort that often accompanies fundamental technological change, so that productivity gains from recent technology advances will appear over time as society adjusts.11Third, the slowdown may be overstated, perhaps greatly, because of measurement issues akin to those at work in the 1990s.12At this point, we cannot know which of these views may gain widespread acceptance, and monetary policy will play no significant role in how this puzzle is resolved.","General","Speech","N/A","148","2019-10"

"2019-10-08","Of course, the pace of job gains is only one of many job market issues that figure into our assessment of how the economy is performing relative to our maximum-employment mandate and our assessment of any inflationary pressures arising in the job market.","General","Speech","N/A","43","2019-10"
"2019-10-08","Based on a range of data and analysis, including our new measure, we now judge that, even allowing for such a revision, job gains remain above the level required to provide jobs for new entrants to the jobs market over time.","General","Speech","N/A","41","2019-10"
"2019-10-08","Thus, the currently reported job gains of 157,000 per month on average over the past three months may well be revised somewhat lower.","General","Speech","N/A","23","2019-10"

"2019-10-30","So we monitor financial stability risks very carefully all of the time. It’s what we do since the financial crisis, as I’ve mentioned before. Currently, we don’t see large imbalances. This long expansion is notable for the lack of large financial imbalances like the ones we’ve seen certainly before the crisis happened. So we have a four-part framework, I’ll quickly mention. The first is leverage in the financial system, which is low by historical standards. The second is funding risk, which is the risk of runnable funding, and that risk is also quite low for banks but also for, you know, the nonbanking financial sector. If you look at asset prices, we see some high asset prices but not broadly across a range. We don’t see bubbles and that kind of thing. And that leaves the fourth, which is leverage in the nonfinancial sector, and that’s households and businesses. So with households, again, we don’t see leverage. We see them actually getting in very good shape financially in the aggregate. Obviously, plenty of households are not in great shape financially, but in the aggregate, the household sector is in a very good place. That leaves businesses, which is where the issue has been. Leverage among corporations and other forms of business, private businesses, is historically high. We’ve been monitoring it carefully and taking appropriate steps. So that’s what I would say, but it’s—corporate debt is one part of a larger part of our framework, and it is something that we’re paying quite a bit of attention to. And it’s been part of the last couple of Shared National Credit exams, and we’ve been monitoring it carefully and taking appropriate action. requirements for banks are too high? Is that something that the Fed might review?","Q&A","Press Conf","","294","2019-10"
"2019-10-30","That’s one factor among many, many factors that factor into our assessment of the outlook. And if we see—if we have—if we—if things happen that cause us to materially reassess the outlook, change our assessment of the outlook in a material way, then we would act accordingly.","Q&A","Press Conf","","47","2019-10"
"2019-10-30","So, not for us to say what the appropriate labor arrangements will be. I will just say, on the General Motors strike, it’s—it’s likely to have taken away a couple of tenths of growth this quarter. That’s likely to come back, maybe, over the first half of next year. And I think it’s good to see it settled. But I’m not going to comment on what the appropriate labor arrangements are. That’s a little bit far afield from our task here. Thank you. Thank you—thank you, Chairman. Wondering if you would categorize the current stance of monetary policy as accommodative, or if it’s just, you know, that neutral was lower than we thought at this time last year. Secondly, you know, we’re now two years removed from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and the economy is growing at about the same pace it was before—2 percent. So, given your mention of fiscal policy and the role it plays in supporting long-term growth, you know, is it fair to say that the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act worked the way it was supposed to? Thanks.","Q&A","Press Conf","","185","2019-10"
"2019-10-30","Sorry, say again what your first question was? I wrote it down, I can’t—","Q&A","Press Conf","","14","2019-10"
"2019-10-30","Ah, yes. Okay. So if you look at where the federal funds rate is trading, it should be in the middle of, or maybe the lower half of, the range of 150 to 175. So that means the real rate is probably modestly below zero. I think my own sense would be that that’s somewhat accommodative policy. I would say, though, that there’s a range of plausible estimates of what the neutral rate of interest is, and I think many of those who make such estimates have moved their estimate down over the course of many years, and that process continues. But, nonetheless, that seems to me to be very likely to be an accommodative stance of policy, and an appropriate stance, given the situation we’re in with continuing downside risks and—that I mentioned. So—","Q&A","Press Conf","","135","2019-10"
"2019-10-30","So we’re—I think, again, I think the most important basic thing is to get the level of reserves back up so that—reserves move up and down with some volatility. We don’t want them to move below the level they were at in the beginning of September, which is, again, between $1.45 and $1.5 trillion. That’s the main thing, that’s the first thing. And we’re on a path to do that, between our temporary open market operations and also our bill purchases. In addition to that—in addition to that, we’re looking at—there are—it’s a big, complicated marketplace, and there was the—one of the surprises, as I mentioned, was that banks that had told us that their lowest comfortable level of reserves was here. They were well above that, and yet they didn’t deploy that liquidity when there seemed to be great opportunities to do that. That didn’t happen. So why is that? And so, we’re doing careful analysis of that. You ask, would we lower capital and liquidity requirements because of this? I don’t think so. I don’t think that’s where this goes. I think where it may go, though, is to look at, for example, intraday liquidity, which used to be a common thing. It used to be a common thing for banks to have intraday liquidity from the Fed, what are called “daylight overdrafts.” That’s something we can look at. Also, there are just a few technical things that we can look at that would perhaps make the liquidity that we have—which we think is ample in the financial system—move more freely and be more liquid, if you will. And those are things we would do, but only if we can do it without compromising safety or soundness or financial stability.","Q&A","Press Conf","","292","2019-10"

As with Brexit—it’s still quite uncertain what will be the result of the election and what the ultimate result will be.

"2019-10-30","So we—we, of course, have watched the situation in Japan and now the situation in Europe, and we—we note that there are significant disinflationary pressures around the world. And we don’t think we’re exempt from those. But, of course, if you look at our current inflation performance, it hasn’t been anything like what we’ve seen in those other places. But we don’t think—again, we don’t think we’re exempt from those pressures, and we are, therefore, strongly committed to having inflation expectations anchored at the level that is consistent with the symmetric 2 percent inflation objective. That’s what we’re committed to, and we’ll use our tools to achieve. So we take—we take the risk very seriously. It’s not—the risk isn’t that inflation might run a couple tenths below 2 percent. The risk is that what we’ve seen is other economies getting on a disinflationary path, that it’s been very hard for them to get off. Once inflation expectations start sliding down, inflation moves down. You have less—interest rates move down as well, because there’s an inflation component in interest rates. And, you know, we think that the right thing to do is to do what we can now to hold and really move inflation expectations up so that they’re squarely and firmly anchored at a level that’s consistent with 2 percent inflation.","Q&A","Press Conf","","221","2019-10"

The sort of rural–urban disparities in—you know, in employment, in growth, in all kinds of things, in health outcomes. You know, it’s a big and growing difference—set of differences. We don’t really have, you know, the tools to address that, but we call things out that are important to our economy that we may not be—that we might have—may not have the right tools to best address national level and at the state level.","Q&A","Press Conf","","131","2019-10"

"2019-10-30","Well, I think monetary policy works through the channels that we understand. I think the effects are clear in what we think of as the interest-rate-sensitive sectors, which are the ones—some of the ones that I mentioned. I think it’s—I think interest rates are a factor in business investment, but I don’t believe they’re the main factor and main driver. And I think, you know, what one would like to see for—to support greater manufacturing activity, business investment, and exports would be a global recovery. And, you know, there’s a lot of monetary policy accommodation and some fiscal accommodation, maybe, in the global economy now. Not here, but perhaps elsewhere. And that should turn—that should support growth in the global economy. And, again, resolution of our trade issues would contribute to that over time as well.","Q&A","Press Conf","","136","2019-10"
"2019-10-30","So that is—our outlook overall is for moderate growth of around 2 percent, which is pretty close to trend. That’s our outlook: could be better, could be worse. You know, it’s—you never say you’ve achieved it. But that’s our outlook. And we feel like our current stance of policy is appropriate as long as that remains broadly our outlook. today—can you tell us a little bit more about the rationale behind moving at this particular meeting as opposed to waiting six weeks and cutting in December, and if there was any discussion about that around the table? Thanks.","Q&A","Press Conf","","98","2019-10"
"2019-10-30","We think—we think that Fed Listens has been a great success for us, and I’m sure we will repeat it. In fact, I would imagine that this entire monetary policy review will become institutionalized and be done every few years. I would say this: In the Beige Book, we talk to educational institutions, health-care institutions, community groups, labor groups—it’s not just businesses. And, by the way, all of those groups are also represented on the boards of our regional banks. We also meet quite regularly at the Board with representatives of low- and moderate- income communities. And so we’re—we’re very conscious of—you know, that we represent all Americans, and we need to hear all of their perspectives. That’s why we—you know, we talk about how low the unemployment rate is, the aggregate unemployment, but we also talk about groups that haven’t experienced that yet. And so we’re—we try to remind ourselves that we serve everybody.","Q&A","Press Conf","","155","2019-10"

"2019-10-30","You know, we don’t see any evidence of that. What we see is—what we see is that the consumer sector continues strong. Again, low initial claims. It’s all—the data we monitor, obviously, is a very broad range of data. We also see now, I think, more clearly the effects of more accommodative monetary policy on various kinds of consumer activity. You’re seeing strong durable goods sales. You’re seeing housing now contributing to growth for the first time in a while—two-tenths, I think, this quarter. And you’re seeing retail sales—the retail home buying by keeping the labor market strong, keeping workers’ incomes rising, and keeping consumer confidence at high levels, where it currently is.","Q&A","Press Conf","","113","2019-10"
"2019-10-30","Honestly, it’s really the—there isn’t any one factor. It’s really the whole range of economic data and also what we see as—about our stance of policy, which we believe is the appropriate stance. It’s really both of those things. Again, if you look at the performance of the economy through this, the consumer sector has been quite resilient. Witness today’s GDP report. And it’s just—again, all the things I went through earlier suggest that that sector continues to be strong. We know that the manufacturing, investment, trade, export sector has been weak. That continues, but nonetheless, overall, we’ve got an economy that is showing moderate growth, and we think that today’s setting—we’re now at 1.5 to 1.75 percent. That is, we believe, an accommodative level and a level that will support that outlook that we have.","Q&A","Press Conf","","136","2019-10"
"2019-10-30","Okay. So, on the “how long,” what we’ve said is that we expect bill purchases to continue at least into the second quarter of next year. And we’ve said that temporary open market operations we expect to continue, I think, at least until the end of January, I believe. Yes, through January. In terms of the causes, so there’s a lot of forensic work going on by us and by market participants and all kinds of analysts. And, you know, one thing is that we think we need reserves to be back up to the level—the minimum level of reserves that we can have during the various fluctuations that you see with reserves is something like $1.45 trillion or a little higher, and that’s the level in early September. So we’re going to be adding reserves to get back to that place. That’s one thing. There are also—it may be—one thing that was surprising about the episode was that liquidity didn’t seem to flow as one might have expected. We had surveyed the banks carefully about what was their lowest comfortable level of reserves, and many banks that were well above that level did not take that excess cash and invest it in the repo market at much higher rates. They just—they didn’t do that, and so the question is why. And are there things that we can do that would—adjustments that we could make that would allow liquidity to flow more easily in the system without in any way sacrificing safety and soundness or financial stability? So we’re looking at those. Those are not things that can happen that can really address the situation in the short term, but those are a range of things that we’re looking at as well.","Q&A","Press Conf","","292","2019-10"
"2019-10-30","Well, I think we’re doing that. I mean, I think we’re keeping—I think we’ve made very substantial adjustments to policy over the course of this year, if you think about it. We entered the year expecting some further rate increases, we went to “patient,” now we’ve done three rate cuts. It’s a very substantial shift, and the effects of it will be felt over time. So we feel like those shifts are appropriate to support exactly the outcomes you’re talking about, which are a continuing strong labor market, continued strong job creation.","Q&A","Press Conf","","92","2019-10"
"2019-10-30","Yes. So I would just say that a—if we were to have a sustained reduction in trade tensions—broad reduction in trade tensions and a resolution of these uncertainties, that would bode well for business sentiment, which is—trade uncertainty’s been weighing on business sentiment, in our judgment, in the judgment of many analysts. And, would take some time after the recent things, but I do think it would be quite positive over time. You come back to the question of raising rates. So that’s really about inflation. And you know, we haven’t yet—we just touched 2 percent core inflation, to pick one measure—just touched it for a few months, and then we’ve fallen back. So I think we would need to see a really significant move up in inflation that’s persistent before we would consider raising rates to address inflation concerns.","Q&A","Press Conf","","140","2019-10"
"2019-10-30","So we’re in the middle—we’re really quite in the middle of it now, and my thinking is still that it will run into the middle of next year. These are—you know, these changes to monetary policy frameworks happen—they don’t happen really quickly, let’s say. Inflation targeting took many years to evolve. I don’t think we’ll take many years here. I think we’ll wrap it up around the middle of next year, would be my guess. I have some confidence in that.","Q&A","Press Conf","","81","2019-10"
"2019-10-30","So, as I mentioned, we do think that inflation expectations are— they’re quite essential, quite central in our framework of how we think about inflation. We need them to be anchored in a level—at a level that’s consistent with our symmetric 2 percent inflation goal. And we think that we need to conduct policy in a way that supports that outcome. That’s what we’re doing now. We’re also, as part of our review, looking at potential innovations, changes to the way we think about things, changes to the framework that would lead us—that would be more supportive of achieving inflation on a 2 percent—on a symmetric 2 percent basis over time. That’s at the very heart of what we’re doing in the review. It’s too early to be announcing decisions. We haven’t made them yet. But we’re in the middle of thinking about ways that we can make that symmetric 2 percent inflation objective more credible by achieving symmetric 2 percent inflation. And it comes down to using your policy tools to achieve 2 percent inflation, and that is the—that is the thing that must happen for credibility in this area. So we’re committed to doing that.","Q&A","Press Conf","","197","2019-10"
"2019-10-30","Rate hikes for next year.","Q&A","Press Conf","","5","2019-10"
"2019-10-30","So the reason why we raised interest rates is because—generally is because we see inflation as moving up—or, in danger of moving up significantly, and we really don’t see that now. Inflation moved down in the first quarter of this year. We thought that that was due, to some extent, to idiosyncratic or transient factors. That turns out to have been the case, so it’s moved back up. But it seems to be settling in below 2 percent. So we really don’t see that risk. And inflation expectations have also kind of moved down and sideways—both surveys and market based over the course of this—of, really, the recent months. And, you know, we think that inflation expectations are very important in driving actual inflation, and we’re strongly committed to achieving our 2 percent inflation objective on a symmetric basis. We think it’s essential that we do that. So we’re not thinking about raising rates right now. There obviously will be times in the future where that will be appropriate. What we’re really thinking now is that our current stance","Q&A","Press Conf","","179","2019-10"
"2019-10-30","Yes, so that is a risk. That’s a risk that we’ve been monitoring, but we don’t see it yet. We don’t see rising initial claims or layoffs or anything like that. But the risk you mention of the weakness in the manufacturing—in export investment, business investment, parts of the economy getting into the consumer side of the economy, we really don’t see that. What we continue to see is good job creation. Unemployment has declined again, and the household survey is now at a 50-year low—has been, you know, very close to 50-year lows for 18 months now. So it’s very positive. The consumer-facing companies that we talk to in our vast network of contacts report, you know, that consumers are doing well and are focused on, weakness in the other areas.","Q&A","Press Conf","","132","2019-10"
"2019-10-30","So, in terms of risks, what I was referring to there—the principal risks that we’ve been monitoring have been, really, slowing global growth and trade policy developments as well as muted inflation pressure. So I was really referring there to trade developments. We have that phase-one potential agreement with China, which, if signed and put into effect, could have the effect of reducing trade tensions and reducing uncertainty, and that would bode well, we think, for business confidence and perhaps activity over time. So that has situations there’s plenty of risk left, but I’d have to say that the risks seem to have subsided. You asked about business investment, and that’s right. Business investment has been weak, and today’s reading was weak as well. And it was broad across equipment and other parts of—all parts of business fixed investment were weak. That’s consistent with what we’ve seen, but that’s the economy we’ve had this year. What we’ve had is an economy where the consumer is really driving growth, and, you know, personal consumption expenditures were almost 3 percent in this quarter—in this first reading for the quarter. So, overall, we see the economy as having been resilient to the—you know, the winds that have been blowing this year.","Q&A","Press Conf","","208","2019-10"
"2019-10-30","We’ll be looking at a full range of data about the economy and about the risks to the outlook, and I’ve given you a sense of what our outlook is. It’s for moderate growth, a strong labor market, and inflation near our 2 percent objective. If something happens to cause us to materially reassess that outlook, that’s what would cause us to change our views on the appropriate stance of policy.","Q&A","Press Conf","","71","2019-10"
"2019-10-30","So what we’ve said, to repeat, is that we see the current stance of policy as “likely to remain appropriate as long as incoming information about the economy remains broadly consistent with our outlook.” And we say that, really, because both of the performance of the economy and the stance of policy. The performance of the economy has been—particularly the household sector—has been strong, has been resilient, with low unemployment, attractive levels of job creation, wages moving up, labor force participation moving up, household confidence, and solid gains in many measures of consumer spending. The manufacturing sector, particularly manufacturing, and also investment and exports have been weaker. But, overall, we’ve seen moderate growth, a strong labor market, inflation moving up. We see the outlook as for more of the same. We also see the risks to the outlook as perhaps having moved in a positive direction over the course of this intermeeting period, although, some remain—some things remain to be seen. So that’s the economy. Turning to policy, we’ve moved the stance of policy over the course of the year to a more accommodative stance, and, after the cuts at the last three meetings, the federal funds rate is now mentioned, we’re going to be watching all factors, And if developments emerge that cause a material reassessment of our outlook, we would respond accordingly.

"2019-12-11","Well, yes. And I would also say that we—if you ask people, and we did ask people, what do you think the natural rate of unemployment is? People were writing down numbers in the fives, and then they were writing down numbers in the fours. And now, unemployment has been in the threes for a year and a half, and we still see wage inflation, as you mentioned. The level of wage inflation has actually moved down, although, there may be compositional effects in that number that may—that may be, to some extent, about younger workers coming in at lower wages that—than retiring workers. But you wouldn’t—that shouldn’t have much of an effect, actually. So why is that? It may just be that there’s more slack in the economy. And I think we are seeing that.

"2019-12-11","Good afternoon, everyone. To begin, I’d like to say a few words about Paul Volcker, who, as you know, passed away earlier this week. Paul Volcker served as Federal Reserve Chair from 1979 to 1987. He accomplished many things during his long and distinguished career at the Fed and elsewhere. Of course, he’s best known for leading the fight to tame the double-digit inflation that he inherited as Chair, thus laying the foundation for the prosperity and price stability we enjoy today. But what is perhaps most admirable about him— more than his many accomplishments—was his character. He believed that there is no higher calling than public service, and he dedicated the lion’s share of his life to it. With courage, integrity, and tenacity, he always pursued the policies that he believed would ultimately benefit all Americans. My colleagues and I continue to draw inspiration from his example. Turning to today’s meeting, my colleagues and I decided to leave our policy rate unchanged after lowering it a total of ¾ percentage point at the previous three meetings. As always, we base our decisions on judgment of how best to achieve the goals Congress has given us: maximum employment and price stability. Our economic outlook remains a favorable one despite global developments and ongoing risks. With our decisions through the course of the past year, we believe that monetary policy is well positioned to serve the American people by supporting continued economic growth, a strong job market, and inflation near our symmetric 2 percent goal. The economic expansion is in its 11th year, the longest on record. Household spending has been strong, supported by a healthy job market, rising incomes, and solid consumer confidence. In contrast, business investment and exports remain weak, and manufacturing output has declined over the past year. As has been the case for some time, sluggish growth monetary and financial conditions, we expect moderate growth to continue. As seen from FOMC participants’ most recent projections, the median expectation for real GDP growth slows slightly over the next few years but remains near 2 percent. The unemployment rate has been near half-century lows for well more than a year, and the pace of job gains remains solid. Participation in the labor force by people in their prime working years, ages 25 through 54, has been increasing. And wages have been rising, particularly for lower-paying jobs. People who live and work in low- and middle-income communities tell us that many who have struggled to find work are now finding new opportunities. Employment gains have been broad based across all racial and ethnic groups and all levels of education. These developments underscore for us the importance of sustaining the expansion so that the strong job market reaches more of those left behind. We expect the job market to remain strong. The median of participants’ projections for the unemployment rate remains below 4 percent over the next several years. Inflation continues to run below our symmetric 2 percent objective. Over the 12 months through October, total PCE inflation was 1.3 percent, and core inflation—which excludes volatile food and energy prices and is a better indicator of future inflation—was 1.6 percent. While low and stable inflation is certainly a good thing, inflation that runs persistently below our objective can lead to an unhealthy dynamic in which longer-term inflation expectations drift down, pulling actual inflation even lower. In turn, interest rates would be lower as well and closer to their effective lower bound. As a result, the scope for interest rate reductions to support the economy in a future downturn would be diminished, resulting in worse economic outcomes projection rises to 1.9 percent next year and 2 percent in 2021. We’re strongly committed to achieving our symmetric 2 percent inflation goal. Over the course of the past year, our views about the path of interest rates that would best achieve our employment and inflation objectives changed significantly, as the economy faced some important challenges from weaker global growth and trade developments. As the year progressed, we adjusted the stance of monetary policy to cushion the economy from these developments and to provide some insurance against the associated risks. In addition, inflation pressures were unexpectedly muted, strengthening the case for a more supportive stance of policy. Rather than modestly increasing the target rate for the federal funds rate this year, as seemed appropriate a year ago, we reduced it by ¾ percentage point. This shift has helped support the economy and has kept the outlook on track. The medians of participants’ projections for economic growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation are little changed from a year ago, aside from a lower inflation projection for 2019. Of course, that is the function of monetary policy—to adjust interest rates to promote employment and price stability in response to forces acting on the economy. We believe that the current stance of monetary policy will support sustained growth, a strong labor market, and inflation near our symmetric 2 percent objective. As long as incoming information about the economy remains broadly consistent with this outlook, the current stance of monetary policy likely will remain appropriate. Looking ahead, we will be monitoring the effects of our recent policy actions, along with other information bearing on the outlook, as we assess the appropriate path of the target range for the federal funds rate. Of course, if Finally, I wanted to note that we’ve been purchasing Treasury bills and conducting repurchase operations, consistent with the plan we announced in December.1 These technical operations are aimed at maintaining an ample level of reserves and addressing money market pressures that could adversely affect the implementation of monetary policy. Our operations have gone well so far; pressures in money markets over recent weeks have been subdued. To address possible pressures in money markets over the year-end, we’ve been conducting term repo operations spanning year-end. We stand ready to adjust the details of our operations as appropriate to keep the federal funds rate in the target range. Thank you, and I’ll be","Opening Statement","Press Conf","","1006","2019-12"
"2019-12-11","Well, that’s—what’s happening there is the fact that the relationship between resource utilization, or unemployment, and inflation has just gotten weaker and weaker over the years. If you go back 50 years, you would have seen that, when there was—when labor markets were tight and unemployment was low, inflation moved right up. And then as the Fed got control of inflation, the connection got weaker and weaker and weaker, to the point where there’s still a connection, but it’s—it’s a very faint one. And I—what that suggests is that you 1 Chair Powell intended to say the repurchase operations were announced in October. up inflation.","Q&A","Press Conf","","105","2019-12"
"2019-12-11","You know, I don’t think that’s right. I mean, we—the—again, the relationship between slack in the economy and inflation is weak, has been weak. The coefficient is something like 0.1. So it’s much, much lower than it used to be, but I don’t know that it’s gone down any more in the last decade. It just is quite faint. But it’s still there. I mean, you can see it. If you look—look at where wages were three or four years ago, they were running around 2 percent. And now the whole group of different wage measures that we monitor has moved up to 3 and 3½ percent, and that suggests tightening. The same thing is true, but much less true, of inflation, the relationship between—in a way, the wage Phillips curve has a higher coefficient than the price Phillips curve does. But we do still see some relationship, and that’s what you’re seeing in those numbers.","Q&A","Press Conf","","156","2019-12"
"2019-12-11","So there’s similarities, conceptual similarities, I think, between the two instances during that long expansion, I guess in ’95 and ’98, when the Fed cut three times only to resume raising rates. And the notion just is that it’s a—the economy needed slightly more accommodative policy, but it wasn’t the end of the expansion, right? And that’s the same situation we believe we’re in here. So this is that we did, in fact, turn out to do three rate cuts. That wasn’t in the plan, you know, in any kind of specific way at the beginning. So that’s the same. What’s different is, you have a very different—you have very different structural characteristics in the economy, particularly around inflation. So now, as you can see, inflation is barely moving up, notwithstanding that unemployment is at 50-year lows and expected to remain there. So the need for rate increases is less. And, by the way, this is—it’s a good thing that, you know, we think we can—I think we’ve learned that unemployment can remain at quite low levels for an extended period of time without unwanted upward pressure on inflation. In fact, we need some upward pressure on inflation to get back to 2 percent. It’s quite different in ’95 and ’98 when there were those two adjustments. So, I would say, similarities and differences.","Q&A","Press Conf","","224","2019-12"
"2019-12-11","So I’m going to take a little step back, and I will—I will get to your specific questions on the year-end and on T-bills. So I guess I want to start by stressing that these are very important operational matters but that are not likely to have any macroeconomic implications. We’d decided back in January to remain an ample-reserves regime, and that means we will be setting the federal funds rate—the range for the federal funds rate through our administered rates and not through active management of the level of reserves. We’re committed to robustly implementing that framework, as you can see by our actions. And the purpose of all this, let’s remember, is to assure that our monetary policy decisions will be transmitted to the federal funds rate, which in turn affects other short-term rates. We have the tools to accomplish that, and we will use them. The purpose of all this is not to eliminate all volatility, particularly in the repo market. So, taking you back, this—as you know, we had very gradually allowed the balance sheet to shrink, we slowed that gradual pace by half in March, and then we ended it in July. Meanwhile, we had surveyed all of the banks, and particularly the large banks who hold a lot of the reserves, and said, “What’s your lowest comfortable level of reserves?” We got those numbers, we added them up, we added a buffer, and it came out sort of at a level that was well below where we were in September. And yet we saw, actually, in September that reserves—the markets acted as though reserves had become scarce. So what had happened was that liquidity, which actually existed, didn’t flow into the repo market, and that had effects on the federal funds rate. So the question is, why did that happen? raised—we’re looking carefully at those. We’re open to ideas for modifying supervisory and regulatory practice in ways that don’t undermine safety and soundness, and a number of ideas are under—under examination there. To go through it sort of by—in time, we started off, really, on September 17 with overnight operations. By October 11 we had created and put into effect a plan. That plan is in effect. It’s working. I think, for the last couple of months, repo markets have been functioning well, short-term rates are stable, markets are functioning. So you asked about year-end. Temporary upward pressures on short-term money market rates are not unusual around year-end. And our—both our repo operations and Treasury bill purchases are intended to mitigate the risks that such pressures pose to our control of the federal funds rate. We think that the pressures appear manageable, and we stand ready to adjust the details of our operations as necessary to keep the federal funds rate in the target range. Our strategy has been—essentially, the key to our strategy is to supply reserves in the near term through—through both overnight and term repo, and, at the same time, we’re raising the underlying level of reserves through bill purchases. I’ll take that now. We’ve said bills—bill purchases. We’ve also said that we were willing to adapt our strategy. We’re not at this place, but if it does become appropriate for us to purchase other short- term coupon securities, then we would be prepared to do that if—if the need arises. So—but we don’t—we don’t—we’re not in that place. It looks—it very much looks like the bill—so those bill purchases are going well, just according to expectations. I mean, the other thing I’ll say is that we’re in, you know, very regular contact with market participants all the time. We’ll be","Q&A","Press Conf","","610","2019-12"
"2019-12-11","So, on the standing repo facility, as you know, we’ve actually had a couple of meetings where we’ve discussed that. I think the standing repo facility is something that’ll take some time to evaluate and create the parameters of and put into place. At the moment what we’re focused on is, you know—we’re now focused on year-end. I should also mention that after the year-end, the sense of it is that as the underlying level of reserves moves up because of bill purchases, as that happens, there will come a time when it will be appropriate for overnight and term repo to gradually decline. We don’t know—we can’t know today what the timing of that will be, but that’s the way—that’s the way we see it going over time.","Q&A","Press Conf","","129","2019-12"
"2019-12-11","Well, as I mentioned, actually, at the last press conference, we think our policy rate is appropriate and will remain appropriate as long as incoming data are broadly in keeping with our—with our outlook. And in order to move rates up, I would want to see inflation that’s persistent and that’s significant—a significant move-up in inflation that’s also persistent before raising rates to address inflation concerns. That’s my view.","Q&A","Press Conf","","69","2019-12"
"2019-12-11","I think what you’re seeing is, you’ve got a full year of the median being flat, which is, we think, accommodative, modestly accommodative, and inflation not moving up very much, as we’ve discussed. And that underscores, I think, the challenge of getting inflation to move up. The Committee has wanted inflation to be at 2 percent, squarely at 2 percent, for—ever since I arrived in 2012. And it hasn’t happened, and it’s just—it’s because there are disinflationary forces around the world, and they’ve been stronger than, I think, people understood them to be. In terms of those out-year rate increases, what’s you’re—you’re looking at rate increases more than a year into the future, and, you know, people will have their own explanations for why they do that, but we—really, none of us have much of a sense of what the economy will be like in 2021. So I think what may be behind some of that is just the thought that, over time, it would be appropriate—if you believe that the neutral rate is 2½ percent, it would be appropriate for your rates to move up in that direction. I will also say to you that a number of people wrote down, and you can’t see this at this level of detail, but—today—but a number of people did write down overshoots of inflation as appropriate—under appropriate policy. increased over the past year as you’ve been dropping the policy rate, what is it that gives you confidence that the Fed has the tools to get inflation back up to target or even overshoot as you just indicated that some people are considering doing?","Q&A","Press Conf","","272","2019-12"
"2019-12-11","Well, it’s just that there is still, empirically, by many, many different—by the work of many different analysts, there is a relationship between resource utilization, by which I mean unemployment, and inflation. It’s just relatively weak. And, by the way, that’s not a bad thing. That means that we can run at low levels of unemployment and have a historically good—in some dimensions—labor market without having to worry about inflation. It also means, though, that it’s not easy to move inflation up. Now, you say, why is there confidence? I mean, I would say there’s more humility than there is confidence in this at this point. It’s been very challenging to get inflation to be at target. If you look around the world, the United States, of all major economies, has been closest to it but still hasn’t quite been able to achieve it. And I would also point out that this year, which has been a good year for the economy, inflation—core inflation is actually running at 1.6 percent, whereas it ran close to 2 percent most of last year. So it’s—it’s a real challenge, and—but I think we’re using our tools as best we can to meet that challenge.","Q&A","Press Conf","","201","2019-12"
"2019-12-11","Well, I—you know, I think the answer to the question of whether saying it is enough to create credibility, the answer to that is “no.” And I think you have to back that up with policy that supports the outcome, and that’s what we’re trying to do. And so the— the changes that we’re looking at to the framework are—I think they take all of that on board, and—but they’re—what they’re—what they are designed to do is to strengthen the credibility of that—of that inflation target, but only if followed by policy. Ultimately, it will take time to establish—to move inflation expectations up from where they are, which appears to be a bit below 2 percent, will not happen overnight. It’ll have to happen over time as credibility is built. You know, the Fed has great inflation credibility, but inflation expectations are anchored at about their 25-year average, which is a few ticks below 2 percent.","Q&A","Press Conf","","156","2019-12"
"2019-12-11","Well, I did see the news today that it appears there’s an agreement to move forward to vote on USMCA, and, of course, it’s not our role to comment on particular trade policies or criticize them one way or the other or evaluate them. I will say, though, that getting—if the deal were to be enacted, then it would certainly remove some of the trade policy We’ve been hearing from our people that we talked to—the many, many people and businesses that we talked to in—through the Reserve Banks that wind up being written up in the Beige Book, and they’ve been telling us all year—for a year and a half, really, that trade policy uncertainty is weighing on the outlook. And I do think that, again, without commenting on it— in any way on the process or the content of the agreement, I think that uncertainty—removal of uncertainty around that would be a positive for the economy as well.","Q&A","Press Conf","","160","2019-12"

"2019-12-11","Well, wage gains have moved up a bit. If you look back three, four years, you’ll see wages are growing around 2 percent. Now you see them moving up, you know, more at 3, 3½ percent. So why aren’t they growing higher, at a faster rate? And it’s a couple of things. I think there are a range of explanations. For instance, one would be that productivity has just been low. So wages should go up to cover inflation and productivity. Productivity has been low, and that—that is very likely to be holding back wages. I also think there are other think that hangs over the wage-setting process—and everywhere, pretty much. You don’t see— there isn’t the kind of traction in the wage market that—even in a tight labor market. Another thing is, though, that the labor market may not be as tight as we had thought it was. And, you know, I think there—there are many, many possible explanations. I will say, though, if you look, for example, at nonsupervisory employees in the labor report, there are— their wages are going up at 3.7 percent. And so, you do see—and wages are going up the most for people at the lower end of the—that’s been true for the last couple of years—lower end of the wage spectrum. So you do see wages moving up. It’s just—they’re not moving up at—at very high rates. And, again, at the end of the day, that probably has most to do with productivity.","Q&A","Press Conf","","250","2019-12"
"2019-12-11","Yes. So the—you know, the focus really is on how to use our strategies, tools, and communications to achieve both sides of the mandate. And you’re right, though, that we’ve talked here a lot about inflation. And I think that the—I think, more broadly, over a period of years—many years—we’ve been learning that the natural rate of unemployment is lower. It’s just been—it’s in estimates not just at the Fed, but among—broadly among economists—labor economists have seen that the connection—that we can sustain much lower levels of unemployment than had been thought. And, as I mentioned, that’s a good thing because that means we—we don’t have to worry so much about inflation. And that’s—and you see the benefits of that in today’s labor market. I—you know, the Fed Listens events are about inflation to a much lesser extent than they are about maximum employment. If you’ve—if you’ve listened to or attended any of those, the discussion—we always focus on inflation as well, but the discussion is really around what’s happening in low- and moderate-income communities and among small businesses. And I think you—you get a perspective, which—you know, we were already getting that from our extensive outreach to community groups and such. But it was help to get—helpful to get it in the context of a monetary policy review. And I think that the fact that these communities have so much— such high levels of unemployment and low levels of labor force participation tells you that there is slack out there. And I think that does also inform our understanding of what we mean by “maximum employment.” And it’s been a very positive—I would say that the Fed Listens events have been—have been extraordinarily positive, and they’re certainly something we’ll repeat. You also see from environments, training is moving up—you hear just a lot—there are a lot of things going on that suggest that people at the margins of the labor force are being pulled in and being given chances, which is a great thing.","Q&A","Press Conf","","335","2019-12"
"2019-12-11","So, on Treasuries versus reserves, we’ve done a ton of work on that. We’ve talked to supervisors, and—it’s interesting, if you look at the banks, they’re all over the place on the composition of their—of their buffer. So you have to have—you have a business model, and that business model suggests what your stress outflows will be, and that suggests what your buffer should be. And you see them making quite different choices. Some of them have lots of reserves and, you know, fewer Treasuries, and then they change their mind and they switch, so it’s not obvious that there’s one thing happening there. Notwithstanding that, we have—we’ve gone out to try to understand that, talking to supervisors. In terms of the—the TGA, you know, we have not tried to pull the TGA into this yet; we’ve taken it as exogenous. I don’t know that at some point we won’t have those discussions, but, you know, Treasury—we want Treasury to be able to have the cash that it needs. And then we should—we are essentially taking that as exogenous to our—to our work. And, you know, there may come a time when we—when we talk about that, but we haven’t done much of that. Standing repo facility—so your question on that is, what are we thinking about it? What are we—I mean, I—so I think we’re—we are more focused, frankly, on the T—the bill purchases, the year-end, and also the review of supervisory and regulatory issues that we’re digging into, and—because we think, you know, there’s—these are structural things—right?— where you could, without sacrificing safety and soundness, just allow the—allow the liquidity that is already there to flow more freely, perhaps by making fairly straightforward, noncontroversial changes. And we think there is some of that, though—and so we’re working hard and fast. But those are things, you know, the—if they take rule changes, it’ll take, you year-end with the overnight facilities and the bill purchases and the term repo—those are—those are things we have to do right now and are doing.","Q&A","Press Conf","","341","2019-12"
"2019-12-11","Well, we did, actually—if you look at the statement, you’ll notice that we—we did call out global developments and muted inflation pressures later in the statement. And why did we do that? You know, those are the things that we’ve been monitoring all year. We’ve put now in place policies that we think are appropriate to address those things, so we’re not revisiting that. But those are—those are just key things, and they haven’t gone away, so we thought it was appropriate to mention them there—still subject to the idea that, for us to change our stance, we would want to see a material reassessment of the outlook.","Q&A","Press Conf","","108","2019-12"

So you’ve—you’ve had quite a significant move in the direction of higher accommodation.

"2019-12-11","So I—this wouldn’t be a—my response will not be about Paul Volcker, but—so, well, you started with Paul Volcker. So, if you look back at 2018—I’ll just take you back to the beginning of 2018. We had an economy growing at 3 percent, we had inflation at 2 percent, and we had a trillion and a half dollars’ worth of stimulus arriving, and the federal funds rate was 1.4 percent. So it wasn’t that—so we moved—we moved policy up during the course of the year. We never got policy even at the level of what we thought the neutral rate was at the time. So there was no sense of it being restrictive. We took steps to make it less accommodative, and that seemed to be the right thing. It still seems to me to be the right thing in hindsight. The idea that we were trying to, you know, slow the economy down—we rate was. So policy was always accommodative during the course of that year. I think what’s happened is, the—obviously, the facts on the ground have changed. You saw the global economic slowdown begin in the middle of last year, gather force, and then continue to go on this year, so you’ve seen a continual weakening. Just look at the IMF’s forecasts of growth from, you know, the spring of 2018 and compare them to now. You’ve had quite a significant—that does affect us. I think, also, the trade situation was just beginning in the middle of ’18, and I think it had—has had—you know, I think there’ll be a very, very wide range of estimates of the effect, but I think it’s had a meaningful effect on output just through the uncertainty channel and, to a lesser extent, through—through, you know, the tariff effects.

Remember that we write all that down, and we send it in, and it gets compiled. But we don’t discuss it at the meeting, and we don’t negotiate a plan. There is no—there’s no agreement. There’s no plan. And when the economic outlook is changing, the dots are—they’re just not a consideration. We’re going to do what we think is the right thing for the economy.

"2019-12-11","No. So let me say, we’re—we’ve been working on this all year. And we’re just at the stage where we’ve had a really interesting discussion about the various tools that we have at the October meeting. At this meeting, we talked about the way monetary policy affects different groups in the economy. So we had a—we talked about the Fed Listens events and some very interesting research. So we’re just getting to the stage where we’re looking at conclusions. You know, what do we take away from all this? And those things— many of those things would wind up as changes, if you will, modifications to the “Statement of Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy.” I think that process will take until the middle be able to—to reach a successful conclusion and make meaningful improvements. I do. In terms of “4 percent”—so that’s—I think it’s premature for people to be saying that this isn’t going anywhere. You know—and if you define going anywhere as a 4 percent inflation target—let me talk about the 4 percent inflation target. So I’ll go back to the point that just saying words is not itself credible. So I think if you said, “We’re raising the inflation target to 4,” what would be the effect of that? I mean, where’s the credibility in that, really? You haven’t been able to get it to 2. So I think we—I think you need to lower your sights a little bit. I also think, is 4 percent—you’d have to ask the question, is that really, you know, price stability? Is that really price stability? Is that within our legal mandate? I mean, I think it’s a fair question. So, you know, I think—I’d like for this review to come out with very—a set of positive results—you know, meaningful improvements. It doesn’t mean it has to solve every problem going forward. We want to—we want to have this be a successful exercise where we meaningfully improve our monetary policy framework. These things don’t tend to move in— you know, in a lurchy way, they tend to evolve.

"2020-01-29","Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for being here. At today’s meeting, my colleagues and I decided to leave our policy rate unchanged. As always, we base our decisions on our judgment of how best to achieve the goals Congress has given us: maximum employment and price stability. We believe monetary policy is well positioned to serve the American people by supporting continued economic growth, a strong job market, and a return of inflation to our symmetric 2 percent goal. The expansion is in its 11th year, the longest on record. Growth in household spending moderated toward the end of last year, but with a healthy job market, rising incomes, and upbeat consumer confidence, the fundamentals supporting household spending are solid. In contrast, business investment and exports remain weak, and manufacturing output has declined over the past year. Sluggish growth abroad and trade developments have been weighing on activity in these sectors. However, some of the uncertainties around trade have diminished recently, and there are some signs that global growth may be stabilizing after declining since mid-2018. Nonetheless, uncertainties about the outlook remain, including those posed by the new coronavirus. Overall, with monetary and financial conditions supportive, we expect moderate economic growth to continue. The unemployment rate has been near half-century lows for well more than a year, and the pace of job gains remains solid. Participation in the labor force by people in their prime working years, ages 25 to 54, is at its highest level in more than a decade. And wages have been rising, particularly for lower-paying jobs. People who live and work in middle-income communities and low-income communities tell us that many who have struggled to find work are now finding new opportunities. Employment gains have been broad based across all racial and Inflation continues to run below our symmetric 2 percent objective. Over the 12 months through November, total PCE inflation was 1.5 percent, and core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, was 1.6 percent. Available data suggest similar inflation readings for December, though we expect inflation to move closer to 2 percent over the next few months as unusually low readings from early 2019 drop out of the calculation. While low and stable inflation is certainly a good thing, inflation that runs persistently below our objective can lead longer-term inflation expectations to drift down, pulling actual inflation even lower. In turn, interest rates would be lower as well—closer to their effective lower bound. As a result, we would have less room to reduce interest rates to support the economy in a future downturn to the detriment of American families and businesses. We have seen this dynamic play out in other economies around the world, and we are determined to avoid it here in the United States. In particular, we believe the current stance of monetary policy is appropriate to support sustained economic growth, a strong labor market, and inflation returning to our 2 percent— symmetric 2 percent objective. As long as incoming information about the economy remains broadly consistent with this outlook, the current stance of monetary policy likely will remain appropriate. We will be monitoring the effects of the policy actions we took last year, along with other information bearing on the outlook, as we assess the appropriate path of the target range for the federal funds rate. Of course, if developments emerge that cause a material reassessment of our outlook, we would respond accordingly. Policy is not on a preset course. I will conclude with a brief overview of our current plans for our technical operations to implement monetary policy. The plan the FOMC announced back in October to purchase federal funds rate. In light of the resulting stability in the federal funds rate and money market conditions more generally, we decided to make a small technical upward adjustment to administered rates to ensure that the federal funds rate trades well within the target range. This action reverses the small downward adjustment made in September when money markets were volatile. As our bill purchases continue to build reserves toward levels that maintain ample conditions, the role played by active repo operations will naturally recede. Over the first half of this year, we intend to adjust the size and pricing of repo operations as we transition away from their active use in supplying reserves. This process will take place gradually, and, as indicated in today’s FOMC directive to the Desk, we expect to continue offering repos at least through April to ensure a consistently ample supply of reserves. Based on current projections, we expect that the underlying level of reserves will durably reach ample levels sometime in the second quarter of this year. As we get close to that point, we intend to slow the pace of purchases and transition to a program of smaller reserve management purchases that maintains an ample level of reserves without the active use of repos. At that point, as in the pre-crisis period, our balance sheet will be expanding gradually over time, reflecting the trend growth in the demand for currency and other Federal Reserve liabilities. All of these technical measures are designed to support the efficient and effective implementation of monetary policy and are not intended to represent a chance—a change in the stance of monetary policy. We are committed to completing the transition to our longer-run ample-reserves regime smoothly and predictably. Of course, we will continue to closely monitor Yes. So, in making that change, our goal was, really—that was, changing “near” to “returning to”—was to avoid possible misinterpretation. So you may remember, in the December minutes we noted that a few Committee members suggested that the language that stated that monetary policy would support inflation near 2 percent could be misinterpreted as suggesting that policymakers were comfortable with inflation running below that level. So we thought about that in the intermeeting period and concluded that it would be appropriate to adjust that language to send a clearer signal that we’re not comfortable with inflation rising persistently—running persistently below our 2 percent symmetric objective. So, that we’re not satisfied with inflation running below 2 percent, particularly at a time such as now where we’re a long way into an expansion and a long way into a period of very low unemployment when, in theory, inflation should be moving up. Sure. So, thanks for that question. Why don’t I say a few things about repos, since I know that’ll be of interest. So, just to bring you back, after last September’s brief turmoil, we took prompt and decisive action, and a result—as a result, money markets have been operating smoothly since then. Just to review, those two adjustments were Treasury bill purchases of at least—of $60 billion—sorry—at least into the second quarter, and term and overnight repo at least through April. And I will get to your specific question. The purpose of the adjustments has been to assure that our policy is transmitted smoothly to the federal funds rate, which requires well-functioning money markets. It doesn’t mean we’re trying to eliminate all volatility in the repo markets. We know that some volatility is normal and expected in well-functioning markets. And, as I mentioned, these adjustments have been successful in supplying an ample quantity of reserves. Money markets operated smoothly, including right through year-end, and the fed funds rate has remained in our target range. So we know—we will know when these adjustments have run their course when reserves are durably at Based on current projections, we expect that the bill purchases will durably bring the underlying level of reserves to the ample level sometime in the second quarter of this year. And when we see that we’ve reached that level, we’ll begin to gradually reduce our asset purchases to the level of the underlying trend growth of demand for our liabilities. As our bill purchases bring the underlying level of reserves up to an ample level on a sustained basis, the necessary quantity of overnight and term repo will gradually decline. We’ve already begun the gradual reduction in the quantity of repo, and we’ll continue to reduce those offering amounts gradually as conditions permit. At some point, we’ll also raise the minimum bid rate. Even after we reach an ample level of reserves, it’s possible that repo operations might play a role as a backstop and support effective control of the federal funds rate. And we’ll continue to discuss that issue and review it under our implementation framework. Coming to your question, in terms of the actually desired reserve level, we know that reserves will continue to move up and down over the course of the calendar year in a wide range depending on volatility in nonreserve liabilities, particularly the Treasury General Account, or So I’ll just—I’ll repeat that—we think that the—we think we need to continue purchases until the—until reserves are at a level at which they will not go below $1½ trillion, roughly, during the course of the calendar year. And we know that the TGA will move up and down there. So they’ll be much higher than that some of the time, but that’s kind of the number, and we think we’ll reach that sometime in the second quarter. That’s our estimate. But we will—we’ll know it when we get there. We’ll know it because we’ll be able to You know, our intention of these—for these adjustments is just to raise the level of reserves and to allow us to conduct monetary policy in an efficient and effective manner. And that’s—that is our sole intention. I pointed out on other occasions, more than once, the differences—the really specific differences between this and the large-scale asset purchase programs. We’ve been over that. In terms of what affects markets, you know, I think many things affect markets. It’s very hard to say with any precision at any time what is affecting markets. What I can tell you is that you know what our intention is. It is to return reserves to an ample level. We expect that to happen during the second quarter. And our plan as we do that is, as those purchases get to that level, we believe we can gradually reduce them, and we believe we can also gradually reduce repo as—as we reach an ample level, as we’re satisfying demand now more from underlying reserves from bill purchases rather than from repo. And, again, the last thing I’ll say is, we’re prepared to adjust the details of this plan as we’ve shown ourselves willing to do depending on conditions. Thanks. I’ll just say that we undertook the review because we felt, and I felt, that it was time to incorporate the realities of what we could call the “new normal” into our policy framework. And some aspects of that new normal would include ongoing powerful global disinflationary trends, which have led to lower-than-target inflation many places in the world; secondly, a flat Phillips curve, by which I mean low levels of sensitivity of inflation to resource utilization—for example, low unemployment; and, thirdly, a much lower neutral real interest rate here and around the world. So those are challenging conditions for monetary policy to deliver on our statutory goals of maximum employment and stable prices, although I would say that, under our existing framework, we’ve been able to succeed or get close to succeeding it for most of the time lately to achieve those goals, although we do struggle, as other central banks do, with the inflation goal. So this is about reviewing our strategy, tools, and communications to assure that they’re the best that we can do to achieve those goals in this environment on a sustained basis. And we continued our discussions at this meeting. I’m very, very pleased at the process so far. It’s included the 14 Fed Listens events around the country, at which we’ve engaged with a full range we’ve reviewed what we’ve learned and also dug deeply into strategy, tools, and communications. I expect that we will conclude the review and announce our conclusions around the middle of the year. Right now, we are just at the point of coming together to put all that together. So I think I’m not the person who should be telling you my personal preferences right now. I’m trying to—and we were trying to come together as a group around a set of answers. I feel very positive about—that we’re going to come up with some good results, and I’m just going to have to wait until we get to that point to announce them. So let me talk about the coronavirus specifically, and then I’ll turn more to global growth more generally. First, it’s a—it’s a very serious issue, and I want to start by acknowledging the significant and considerable human suffering that the virus is already causing. There is likely to be some disruption to activity in China and possibly globally based on Of course, the situation is really in its early stages, and it’s very uncertain about how far it will spread and what the macroeconomic effects will be in China and its immediate trading partners and neighbors and around the world. So, in light of that uncertainty, I’m not going to speculate about it at this point. I will just tell you that, of course, we are very carefully monitoring the situation. And, you know, as you suggested, our framework ultimately is, what are the potential ramifications for the So our stated goal is to keep IOER and the federal funds rate well within the range. That’s it. Well within the range. And that, clearly, you know—5 basis points from the bottom or from the top isn’t that. So that’s why we moved back up. You’re right. Last year we were—we saw some tightness as reserves were draining out of the system. We saw points. So now we’re—now we are well within the range, I would say. Don’t know that. We want it to be well within the range. I think we’ll continue to adjust it to the extent it’s appropriate. Ultimately, what we’re trying to do is deliver a federal funds rate that’s well within the range. IOER is just a tool to do that. If we—if we need to make changes to keep it well within the range, we’ll do that. It just means—I mean, the thing that matters for the economy is that we keep the federal funds rate—which is the rate that, of course, transmits into other money market rates, which ultimately transmit into all kinds of financial conditions—that’s what we care about. So, ultimately, we will—we will use that tool to keep it well within the range. I did. I don’t think—I’m not sure your colleagues did. [Laughter] So I’ll go in reverse order. When we—when we make decisions about the steps we’re going to be taking in that adjustment process that I described at some length, we’ll be making them as early as we can and as transparently as we can—and specifically. But we’re not at that stage. It’s January, and we’re several months away from— from that. In terms of the standing repo facility, as I mentioned in, I guess, in my answer to an earlier question, there may well be a role for repo in this system even after we’re at an ample- reserves level. Now, we haven’t decided what that role is, we have not decided—we haven’t at all made a decision on a standing repo facility. We haven’t. We’ve had a couple of discussions about it, as you know, back in, I guess, June and October. And there’s a range of views. We’re going to return, I would say, fairly soon to this question. And I think it was wise to wait, because we’re still getting a better sense of what that— what that world looks like. And, you know, it’s really going to be a question of, how useful will it be? What will be the costs and benefits? And my thinking is, we will return to that fairly soon, and I wouldn’t assume a decision one way or the other. Really, we haven’t made one, because we haven’t had to. And I think you—when you delay, you get more information by waiting. It’s good to wait. We don’t have any urgency in making that decision, because we’re still trying to find that sort of stable equilibrium where we’re in an ample-reserves regime. that you think severe weather events are happening more often and that the Fed is monitoring what that could physically do to a bank or a financial institution, but that’s sort of one institution. Do you think there’s a systemwide risk that may—that could develop from climate change? So that’s an interesting question—the question being, is there a systemwide financial stability risk? I’d say, over—over the longer term, it’s certainly possible, and I would say that sort of feeds into the way we’re thinking about climate change as an institution. So, as I’ve mentioned, climate change is an important issue, a very important issue, but it’s essentially assigned to many other agencies in the federal government and state governments for leadership on that. And, importantly, society’s overall response to climate change needs to be decided by elected officials and not by the Fed. All of that said, if you look at our mandate, we’ve got a monetary policy mandate and, more immediately perhaps, a supervisory mandate where we’re supervising financial markets, utilities, and financial institutions, banks. And we haven’t—we share overall responsibility for financial stability with a number of agencies. And that latter part—I think the public has every right to expect and will expect that we will assure that the financial system is resilient and robust against the risks from climate change. Now, I think that’s got to be right. We are in the very early stages, as are other central banks, in understanding just what that means. And there’s quite a lot of work going on around the world at other central banks and at the Fed, too, to think that through. But I do think it’s—in that sense, it has to be part of our role, and—but not the overall response of society to climate change. That’s not us. So we’ve attended all of their meetings and taken part in them, and we’ve been looking at joining in one form or another and talking to them about that. We probably will do that at some point. So that’s—that’s an ongoing question. But we’re very much attending those meetings and taking part in them. Yes. So I guess I’d start by saying that the fact that we’ve reached a phase-one deal with China and the fact that we’ve moved ahead closer to getting USM[C]A agreed—those are potentially positive things for the economy without question. Without question. And financial markets—the reaction of financial markets is very consistent with that perception. A sustained reduction in uncertainty over time should improve business sentiment, investment, which would provide some additional support for the economy. It’s important, though, to bear in mind a couple of things. First, trade policy uncertainty remains elevated. Businesses continue to identify it as an ongoing risk. We still have two or even three active trade discussions that are going on in the public square right now. So it hasn’t gone away, and we’ve just come through a round of talking to our vast network of comments— sorry, contacts in the business world. And I think, clearly, these are seen as positive developments going forward, but there’s a bit of a wait-and-see attitude—is this going to be There’s also the global economy. You could—you could well see manufacturing—as I mentioned, manufacturing PMIs have started to tick up consistently among both advanced economies and emerging market economies. We do not see a decisive recovery, but it’s possible that this mix of positive developments and also accommodative financial conditions could spur further growth. Yes. As for those forces, so, as we indicated, we would undertake a, you know, serious review of that question and look at both our regulations and also supervisory practices. And we’d be prepared to adjust those in ways that might encourage liquidity to flow more easily in the system as long as it didn’t undermine safety and soundness. And so we’ve undertaken that, and we’ve done a ton of work, actually. We don’t have anything to announce here today, but I feel good about the—what we’ve learned there. I think—you mentioned other factors. We will be announcing our findings. I’m not going to give you a time, but we’re— we’re well along in that assessment at this time. I think we also found out, though, that the level of reserves that we need in the system to conduct our operations without frequent resort to open market operations was higher than we had thought and was higher than others had thought, too. We learned that we can’t let reserves—we will be substantially higher than $1½ [trillion], but they won’t ever go below. So $1½ [trillion] is not a target level. It is the bottom of a range in which reserves will be expected to move. Well, let me just stress that we have a very specific and important reason for caring about money market operations generally, and that just is that we are—our monetary policy decisions are transmitted through the financial markets—through the money markets into other financial markets and into broader financial conditions. So we care that money markets are operating smoothly. And they stopped operating smoothly, briefly, back in September. And so we acted. This is a one-time thing that we’re doing to adjust the level of reserves so that the money markets will be able to operate smoothly on an ongoing basis. Repo markets are important, because that’s where Treasury securities—the purchase of Treasury securities, which is the way—you know, the federal—part of the way the federal government is funding its operations. It’s the way those are financed. So these are largely Treasury securities that have been purchased by dealers to—for distribution to—and buyers, to a substantial extent. That’s what’s going on in the Treasury repo market. So it’s just the financing volatility in the repo market can affect the transmission of—of our policy decisions to federal funds rate, and that really is important for the public. Sure. So we will be looking tomorrow and voting on a—a new part of—part of the existing Volcker rule, and that is the covered fund provisions of the rule. And we’ll be making a bunch of proposed revisions that we believe are faithful to both the letter and the spirit of the law. We’re going to put those proposals out for public discussion, and we’re going to listen carefully, as we always do, to public comments on those proposals. Again, we believe that they will be—and you’ll see them tomorrow—will be public—you know, will be publicly—we have a Board meeting tomorrow to do that. It’s covered funds. It’s—so it’s that covered—so it’s not the proprietary trading part of Volcker. It’s the covered funds part. You know, we’ll—we think that what we’re doing is—is very consistent with safety and soundness and absolutely consistent with the letter and spirit of the Well, China has had a problem for some years, including from that period—2014 up until, I guess, ’17 or ’18, and I thought—which was essentially just a lot of debt for an emerging market. For an economy at the—at the stage of evolution of the Chinese economy, they had very high levels of debt—not sovereign debt the way we think of it, but more business debt—debt of state-owned enterprises and also just private businesses. And a couple of years ago the authorities decided to try to get that under control—to stop the growth and to control it. And that—as I mentioned, that’s one of the reasons why Chinese growth slowed, and it’s one of the reasons why global growth slowed, because we felt that. And they’ve actually stuck to that even during this difficult period when they were experiencing, you know, strains from trade negotiations and that kind of thing. The authorities have stuck to that We don’t think that—that there’s any imminent risk there, although you—as you point out, the coronavirus thing is a significant thing, which will—will have some effects on the Chinese economy, at least in the short term. The Chinese economy is very important in the global economy now. And, you know, we—when China’s economy slows down, we do feel that—not as much as countries, though, that are near China or that trade more actively with China, like some of the Western European countries. We still have—you know, 85 percent of our economy is domestic. And we have a much smaller external sector, trade sector, than other economies just because of our physical location. Well, so, two questions. I mean, in terms of liquidity, I think what we’re doing is what I said: We’re trying to raise the level of reserves back up to a level so that banks can meet their reserve requirements, and that there’s enough reserves in the system that we don’t see reserve scarcity, and we don’t have to use repo operations to provide additional reserves. So I think, as I mentioned, we believe we can get to that state at the current pace sometime in the second quarter. change the stance of monetary policy. These were designed to provide more reserves and, really, to do that in order to enable better transmission of our—of our rate decisions into the economy under our chosen framework. That’s really the purpose of what we’re doing. Well, as you know, we’re comfortable with our current policy stance. We think it’s appropriate. We think it’ll remain appropriate as long as data coming in are broadly in keeping with our outlook. Over time—over time, though—let me take a step back. Over time, an average inflation-targeting framework would be different than our current framework, in the sense that it wouldn’t be a—there would be some aspect of trying to make inflation average 2 percent over time, which means, if it runs below 2 percent for a time, it has to run above to bring the average up. So that is a different framework. Our current framework is one where we say—or we’d be equally concerned with deviations of inflation from target on either side. But that isn’t—that doesn’t suggest an intention specifically to have those deviations be symmetric. In other words, that would— consistent with that would be having all the deviations be on one side, which is what we’ve had, actually. So I think it is a change in framework, and over time it would lead to a different So we—we look at a very broad range of financial conditions where—there isn’t any one financial condition that we—that we look at. And when we look at financial conditions, what matters for the real economy is substantial changes in—or, material changes in financial conditions that are sustained over a period of time. If I can, maybe I’ll—maybe I’ll answer that in the context of our overall financial stability framework. That’s one way to look at it. So we look at—when we look at financial stability, we look at—really, we’ve got four pillars to that, the first of which is leverage in the financial system that is at a comfortable level. Our banks, particularly our large banks, have high levels of capital. The second is leverage in the nonfinancial sector, and that divides into households and businesses. Households’ debt to GDP is—has been coming down since the financial crisis. It’s not moving up. It’s at low—low levels compared to what it was before the crisis. So not every household—but, in the aggregate, household debt is in a good place, a very good place. Business debt has been moving up. We’ve been calling that out for more than a year—substantially more than a year, and it’s something we’re focused on. And we’ve taken appropriate measures and are monitoring carefully. But we think it’s not something that would threaten financial stability, but more be an amplifier. you look at risk spreads, they’re narrow. If you look at P/Es, they’re high. I think the way to think about—a good way—one way to think about equity prices, though, is, what’s the premium you’re getting paid to own equities rather than risk-free debt? And that’s also at fairly low levels, but not extremely low levels. So valuations are high, but not at extremes. The final factor is funding risk. Are big financial institutions and other players in the financial system funded with stable funding, or is there a lot of run risk? And the answer is, very stable funding, for the most part. So if you look at, overall—what you see, in my view, is, vulnerabilities to the financial—to financial stability are moderate overall. So let me say that I think this is a good time to do—to update CRA, really, in a way that is a win–win both for the intended beneficiaries—low- and moderate- income communities—and also for banks that would like to have more certainty about—about what does and doesn’t qualify and that sort of thing. The law can both be more effective and more efficient is—it comes down to. And we think this is a good way. It’s also just a good time to take on board the way the delivery of banking services has changed through technology and demographic change as well. We worked very hard to try to get on the same page with the other two agencies. We think that an interagency final rule together would be the best outcome. We’re sorry we haven’t been able to get there, and we still hold out some hope that we will be able to. We spent a lot of decisions about what we’re going to do, about whether we’ll propose—I mean, our focus has been entirely on trying to get to agreement with the OCC, really. So we haven’t made any decisions about what we’re going to do going forward. In terms of, you know—Governor Brainard led our oversight committee over these activities for many years, and I asked her to take the lead on CRA modernization, which is a high priority for us. I was comfortable with her speech, and I’m comfortable with the work we’ve done and with the Fed’s position on this. As I said, we haven’t chosen to bring a proposal forward. We haven’t decided what to do, whether—going forward. And we’re not going to comment on the other proposal. It’s just not appropriate to do. It’s not about us. It’s not about our views. It’s about the views of the interested parties. So I do agree that—the principles that he articulated of firm and fair supervision and effective transparency in communications. I also think it’s a good thing that we would have brighter lines to define our LISCC supervisory portfolio, which we haven’t really had to date. Remember that when a firm moves from one portfolio to another, that doesn’t mean that its level of scrutiny or supervision will change. and, you know, how to—how to balance the desire for transparency and due process in everything the government does with the needs of confidential supervision. It’s a very challenging question. It’s one that could use further thought. And as far as the specific, you know, proposals, there’s—you know, they’re interesting, you know, and need further development and will need lots of comment and that sort of thing. Sure. So we—we are assigned a job by Congress, and that is to use our tools to pursue maximum employment and stable prices. And that’s what—that’s our focus. Now, monetary policy is a blunt instrument, but it’s a powerful one. So I think if you look— look at the time since the financial crisis. That was—in the week [wake] of fairly modest growth, it was a powerful recovery in the labor market. And part of that just is the effect of lower interest rates. So, if—so many, many people benefit from low interest rates. In fact, you don’t hear—when you talk to the low- and moderate-income communities, one thing you don’t I absolutely sympathize with people. If you’re living on just the interest in a bank or on fixed-income generally, then that’s a challenging thing. On the other hand, if you own a home, home values—the housing market has recovered, other financial assets have recovered, so—but, yes, for some people who are limited to those sources plus whatever other help they get, it can be challenging. I mean, we have to do what’s best for the—for the overall society and the economy. That’s—those are our orders from Congress. Thanks very much.","Full Text","Press Conf","","5452","2020-01"

"2020-03-03","Earlier today the Federal Open Market Committee announced a ½ percentage point reduction in the target range for the federal funds rate, bringing that range to 1 to 1¼ percent. My colleagues and I took this action to help the So, what changed? Of course, we’ve been carefully monitoring the situation since it first became known and waiting to see how it would evolve. And I think we’ve come to the view now that this—that it is time for us to act in support of the economy. And once you reach that decision, we decided to go ahead. So what changed, really, was, I would say, over the course of the last couple weeks, we’ve seen a broader spread of the virus—we’ve seen it begin to spread a bit here in the United States. But, for us, what really matters, of course, is not the epidemiology, but the risk to the economy. So we saw a risk to the outlook for the economy and chose to act. In terms of my confidence that we will return to—what was your question? Was that a question? Okay. So, first question. We—we’re in active discussions with central banks around the world on an ongoing basis, as you would guess. I’ve been in regular contact with central bank leaders from around the world. That will continue. Central banks are doing what makes sense in their particular institutional contexts, but we’re all talking to each other on an ongoing basis. And our action today represents what we think is the right policy for us in our particular institutional context under our domestic mandate. You saw this morning’s G-7 statement of finance ministers and governors, and I think that statement does reflect coordination at a high level in the form of a commitment to use all available tools, including health-care policy, fiscal policy, and monetary policy as “appropriate.” So, in terms of fiscal policy, again, not our role. We have—we have a full plate with monetary policy. Not our role to give advice to the fiscal policymakers, but you saw the mention in the G-7 statement—as “appropriate” as well. So the sense of the G-7, you know, is to—we have seven countries, obviously, and different policies, different situations, different mandates—a lot of overlap. And the sense of that is to get together as a group and say at a high level that “These are the things we’re going to do. We are going to use our tools—all of our tools in a strong way to—to try to support the economy.” So that’s a statement of general support. I think within that you will see actions. You’ve seen our action. And I think it’s up to individual countries—individual fiscal policies and individual central banks—to do what they’re going to do. I would think it will be— it’s possible there will be some more—more formal considered coordination as we move forward. In terms of—in terms of moving forward, I would say that we do like our current policy stance. We think—we think it’s appropriate to—to support achievement of our dual-mandate goals. But as I said in my—in my statement, we’re prepared to use our tools—tools and act appropriately, depending on the flow of events. I can’t point to any one thing. It’s always a range of things. So we don’t—we don’t see any of that happening yet. Of course, we are—we are thinking about what we can do should those things happen. There’s no evidence of it yet. The economy continues to perform well—perform well. As I mentioned, we do hear concerns, particularly from those most directly exposed, but there’s nothing in that nature: Financial markets are functioning in an orderly manner and all that sort of thing. I think when it—when it comes to those sorts of issues, though, we will be—the supervisors will be working with banks to assure that they work with their—with their borrowers and that sort of thing. So I can imagine us doing those sorts of things, but it’s—those things are not upon us at the moment. Well, as you know, we’re in the middle of a review of all of our tools. So if you go back a few meetings, we’ve talked about what our toolkit is, and we’ve put that in the minutes. But in the current context, no. What we discussed is the current stance of policy, is it appropriate—came to the view that it was appropriate to make a change and went ahead and did that today. Sure, I’d be glad to. So the virus outbreak is something that will require a multifaceted response. And that response will come, in the first instance, from health- care professionals and health policy experts. It will also come from fiscal authorities should they determine that a response is appropriate. And it would be—come from many other public- and private-sector actors: businesses, schools, state and local governments. But there’s also a role for monetary policy. Monetary policy can be an effective tool to support overall economic activity. We do recognize that a rate cut will not reduce the rate of infection. It won’t fix a broken supply chain. We get that. We don’t think we have all the answers. But we do believe that our action will provide a meaningful boost to the economy. More specifically, it will support accommodative financial conditions and avoid a tightening of financial conditions which can weigh on activity, and it will help boost household and business confidence. That’s why you’re seeing central banks around the world responding as they see appropriate in their particular institutional context. So, on your first question, we’re always going to set monetary policy at a given time in a way that we think best serves our dual-mandate goals, and it’s as simple as that. So, you know, we’ll—if we get to a place where we think it’s an appropriate time to change thinking we have, based on our—what we learned from our outreach to businesses, nonprofits, educational institutions that we get every cycle through the Reserve Banks, and the best analysis, the best research. We’re always going to make our decisions in the interests of the American people to carry forward and try to achieve the mandates that Congress has given us. And we’re never going to consider any political considerations whatsoever. We will not do that, and it’s very important that the public understand that. So we’re—we are hearing—I would just say, the effects are at a very early stage. But you are hearing concerns from people—for example, in the travel business or the hotel business and things like that. That’s—that’s what you are hearing. But you don’t see things showing up in actual data. You do see them showing up in, sort of, sentiment forecast indicators and things like that. We expect that will continue. It will probably grow. And that’s one of the reasons why we’ve come to the view that it would be appropriate for us today to move to support the economy. And that’s what we’ve done. Thanks very much.","Full Text","Press Conf","","1174","2020-03"

I think there’s more risk to financial stability in an era like—like that than there is when things are really placid, and, you know, we’re going home at 4 o’clock and kind of bored over here. That’s not the case right now. So, financial stability—I would say those—those risks do rise at a time of high volatility, particularly a time where we’re presenting—presented with a challenge that is—is kind of unique, really—it’s not something we’ve all done before. I also want to add, though, that, you know, we’re strongly focused on financial stability. We monitor it carefully. We’ve built a very resilient financial system.

So, that’s—that’s an important job for fiscal policy. More broadly, after that, there’s the question of—of fiscal—broader fiscal stimulus, and I think that’ll depend on the path of the economy. I—I think there is such a wide range of possibilities here that it’s some—it’s very hard to predict. But there could certainly be—there could certainly be, you know, a need for that.

"2020-03-15","So I guess your first question is, how—how do we think about the time—the time for this thing? You know—and the truth is, we just don’t know, and, you know, the experts we talk to will say that they don’t know, and that it’s, in fact, unknowable. It’s going to depend on a number of things. First, it’s the measures that we take to, you know, to—with the social distancing, and the—all the things businesses and school and everyone’s doing now. And that will depend, to some extent, on how compliant people are. You can see that some countries have had a—have been able to, through aggressive measures and really high compliance—have been able to bend the curve and—and do that. And whether we succeed or—you know, that’s really the question. And I wouldn’t—I wouldn’t, you know—I’ll resist the impulse to guess. I really don’t know what that will be. In terms of the toolbox, as I mentioned, we think we have plenty of policy space left, plenty of power left in our tools, and I would point in particular to the liquidity tools. That, I think, is—is right now the most important thing that we’re doing. Our interest rates will matter—cuts will matter now to borrowers who will get some relief from our cuts, but they’ll In addition, as I mentioned, we—you know, we have room to provide forward guidance, to do more asset purchases. I think there—there is room for us to do what we need to do. I—I would just close, though, by saying that, you know, typically, fiscal policy does play a major role when—when there are downturns. You saw—you’ve seen that in many past downturns, and that’s beyond just the automatic stabilizers. Sometimes fiscal policy comes in on a discretionary basis, and that—that will probably need to be the case here as well.","Q&A","Press Conf","","308","2020-03"
"2020-03-15","Well, I would say this. You know, we have different tools. I think we do, actually, work pretty closely with the Treasury Department and—and cooperate with them on things, with clear lines of delineation. For example, the Treasury Department has authority over fiscal policy. That’s not our job. It’s their job, with other parts of the Administration. It’s just that—like that for us with monetary policy. We have sole responsibility for monetary policy and strong instructions from Congress to conduct it in an independent, nonpolitical way. So those two things are—one for each of us. But in the middle there, there are areas where we—where we can cooperate. And also, there’s a long history. You would want the finance ministry and the treasury [and the central bank] to be talking in every major economy in the world. You would want them to be regularly exchanging information—professional relationships not just at the, you know, the Chair-to- Treasury-Secretary level, but also through the organization. For example, the New York Fed is have professional, good working relationships up and down the chain there, and, you know, that—that seems to me to be working. And there is—there’s also quite a lot of coordination in other respects with—of course, with foreign central banks, but you didn’t ask about that.","Q&A","Press Conf","","214","2020-03"
"2020-03-15","Good evening, everyone. Today the Federal Reserve took a number of actions to support American families and business and the economy overall and to promote the flow of credit as we weather disruptions caused by the coronavirus. The virus is having a profound effect on people across the United States and around the world. On behalf of my colleagues at the Federal Reserve, our first concern is for those who’ve been harmed. Families, businesses, schools, organizations, and governments at all levels are taking steps to protect people’s health. These measures, which are essential for containing the outbreak, will nonetheless understandably take a toll on economic activity in the near term. While the primary response to this challenge will come from our health-care providers and policy experts, economic policymakers must do what we can to ease hardship caused by the disruptions to the economy and to support a swift return to normal once they have passed. The Federal Reserve’s role is guided by our mandate from Congress to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people, along with our responsibilities to promote the stability of the financial system. Today we reduced the target range for our policy interest rate by 1 percentage point, bringing it close to zero, and said that we expect to maintain the rate at this level until we’re confident that the economy has weathered recent events and is on track to achieve our maximum employment and price stability goals. In addition, we took other actions to support the flow of credit to households and businesses. Before describing our actions more fully, I will share how my colleagues and I currently view the economic outlook. The economy came into this challenging period on a strong footing. The unemployment rate was 3.5 percent in February and has been at or near half-century lows for almost two years. Job gains have been running at a solid pace, well above what is needed to been rising, particularly for lower-paying jobs. Overall economic activity has been expanding at a moderate rate, even though weak growth abroad and trade developments have been weighing on some sectors.","Opening Statement","Press Conf","","355","2020-03"
"2020-03-15","Thank you. So, based on our discussions today and many conversations with participants, it’s fair to say that we have a range of views about the path of the economy, as is always the case with the Fed. But, in general, I’d say that we see the","Q&A","Press Conf","","47","2020-03"

You know, we looked at negative policy rates during the Global Financial Crisis, we monitored their use in other","Q&A","Press Conf","","104","2020-03"
"2020-03-15","So I feel fine. I feel very well, and so there’s no reason for me to be tested. We are observing—we’re trying to model good behavior here, so we’re observing quite a lot of teleworking. And also, we’re—you know, we’re not having a lot of big, crowded meetings—we’re not having any big, crowded meetings. So we’re trying to observe all of the things that the professionals tell us to do. I do expect to do some teleworking because I want to model that—that it’s okay for the people to do so. In fact, it’s important for them to do so. So I will do that. In terms of our—of our toolkit, let me say first that, you know, I think we do have plenty of space to adjust our policy. I mentioned our liquidity tools—you know, we have a lot of power in our liquidity tools, and, as I mentioned, we’re prepared to use them. In addition, we’ve got plenty of space left to offer forward guidance, asset purchases, and adjust those policies, so I something we’re actively considering right now.","Q&A","Press Conf","","181","2020-03"
"2020-03-15","Right. So, on—on inflation, you know, the—the economy’s performed so well, really, over the last few years, and right up through January: historically low unemployment—50-year-low unemployment for a couple of years, 11 years—almost 11 years of expansion so far, and yet inflation lingered below 2 percent. So we’ve been concerned that inflation not move down further. It’s not at all a question of deflation. It was a question of not getting inflation up to our target on a robust, symmetric kind of a way. So, with this coronavirus arriving, we judged that the—the net effects of this will be to— to have inflation move down even a little bit more. And it’s—it’s not a question—it’s not—it’s not an issue of deflation. Again, it’s just an issue of inflation probably falling even a bit further. We expect, with uncertainty, that, you know—that it will fall a little bit further, at least, below where it has been. We are—of course, we don’t have the legal authority to buy other securities other than the ones we already buy, and we’re not seeking authority to do so. We haven’t discussed that at the—at the FOMC, and it’s not—it’s not legal authority that we’re seeking.","Q&A","Press Conf","","200","2020-03"
"2020-03-15","So let me tell you how, I think—what our tools can accomplish, and—and really what they’re not designed to accomplish. So what our liquidity operations—and I’ll talk specifically about the Treasury and MBS purchases—are designed to do is to assure the proper functioning of the Treasury and MBS markets. The Treasury market is one of the most important, perhaps the most important, market in the world. It’s probably the most liquid large market in the world. The MBS market is very important: It’s closely linked to the Treasury market, and it’s the way that our monetary policy decisions flow through to borrowers in the real economy. So, two very important markets. And they had reached levels of very high illiquidity, and—to the point where we—as you know, last week we offered financing—very large amounts of financing. And after that, we bought assets across the curve to try to support liquidity and return to normal function. And we found that that helped, but, nonetheless, we thought we had to do more. And we knew what we had to do, which was the asset purchase programs that we did today. And those are designed to restore those key markets to normal function. functioning well, then other markets—then that will spread to other markets. And those are the markets that—that amount to—that—where households and businesses typically get credit. So we know that dysfunctional financial markets—a dysfunctional financial system, really, can have very big negative effects on the economy. We saw that during the financial crisis. This is a very different situation, but, nonetheless, we thought it was quite important for us to take strong measures to support—to support proper market function in these important markets. Now, you asked about households. It’s true, we don’t have the tools to reach individuals and particularly small businesses and other businesses and people who may be out of work or whose businesses may not—may experience a period of very low activity. We don’t have those tools. We have the tools that we have, and we use them. I think we’ve used them quite aggressively for the benefit of the public. But this is a multifaceted problem, and it requires answers from different parts of the government and society. I mean, I think that, by far, the most important is the response of the health-care workers and health-care policymakers. After that, fiscal policy. We’ve had one round of fiscal policy, another coming. I think fiscal policy is a way to direct relief, really, to particular populations and groups. Monetary policy has a role, and it really is in, you know—our original role was providing liquidity to financial systems when they’re under stress, and that’s—that’s really part of what we did today. The other role is to support demand through lower interest rates, and we did that. You—you asked about fiscal as well, and I guess I’ve sort of covered that. We do think fiscal response is—is critical, and we’re happy to see that those measures are being considered, and we—we hope they are effective. Business Network. In your statement, you say that the market measures of inflation have declined. The Fed has undershot inflation in the last year, and that’s become one of the focuses of the FOMC meetings. Now, does the Federal Reserve see deflation coming, and is this large cut meant to get in front of any more inflation? Plus, as a second question, would the Fed consider buying securities outside of Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities? Thank you.","Q&A","Press Conf","","582","2020-03"
"2020-03-15","What was it again? What was the question again? Just tell me. I can’t read my writing. [Laughter]","Q&A","Press Conf","","18","2020-03"
"2020-03-15","Okay, sorry. So that’s the “in coming months” language. Let me tell you what we were doing there. So there’s no monthly cap here. There's no weekly cap. The Desk is going to go out, and it’s going to buy at a strong rate that is—that we think will restore market function—restore liquidity as quickly as it can be restored. And that language is open ended, and it’s meant to send a signal to the market that—that, you know, we’re not going to be bound by, for example, $60 billion a month or anything like that. We’re going to go in strong starting tomorrow, and we’re going to buy across the curve, and we’re going to buy MBS, and we’re really going to use our tools to do what we need to do here, which is restore these important markets to normal function. So that—that’s really what that is. As far as—as the policy rate, what we’ve said is that we will maintain the rate at this level until we’re confident that the economy has weathered recent events and is on track to achieve our maximum employment and price stability goals. So, you can see, that’s the test we’ve written down. And if you—if you look at it, you’ll see that some things have to happen goals. So that’s a test we’ll be looking at, and I think it suggests that, you know, we’re going to be watching and willing to be patient, certainly.","Q&A","Press Conf","","244","2020-03"
"2020-03-15","So what—what I can tell you definitively is what the purpose of the asset purchases was, and I mentioned this in my statement. And it really is to support the availability of credit in the economy—households and businesses—and thereby support the overall economy. How do they do that? They do that by supporting proper market functioning in the Treasury market and the MBS market. So you see—and I think you’ll see—as these purchases roll forward, you will see the Treasury market and the MBS market returning to normal market function, and that will actually support economic activity. That will be a positive for economic activity. In terms of what it’s labeled, that’s of less interest to me. I really think we are very clear in our minds what we’re doing this for and what the logical effects would be, which would be— which would be both better market function and—and—you know, when there’s better market function, it will be—you know, policy will be supporting the economy better.","Q&A","Press Conf","","167","2020-03"

And we were in a place—only two months ago, we were well into—beginning the second half of the 11th year is where we were, and every reason to think that it was ongoing. We were hearing from minority—low- and moderate-income and minority communities that this was the best labor market they’d seen in their lifetime. All the data supported that as well. And it is heartbreaking, frankly, to see that all threatened now. All the more need for our urgent response—and also that of Congress, which has been urgent and large—and to do what we can to avoid longer-run damage to the economy, which is what I—I everything we can to avoid that longer-run damage and try to get back to where we were, because I do very much have that concern. I think everyone is suffering here, but I think those who are least able to—to bear it are the ones who are, you know, losing their jobs and losing their incomes and have little cushion to—you know, to protect them in times like that. So, yes, that’s a very big concern.","Q&A","Press Conf","","238","2020-04"
"2020-04-29","Good afternoon. Thanks for joining us today. I would like to begin by acknowledging the tragic loss and tremendous hardship that people are experiencing both here in the United States and around the world. The coronavirus outbreak is first and foremost a public health crisis, and the most important response is coming from those in the front lines in hospitals, emergency services, and care facilities. On behalf of the Federal Reserve, let me express our sincere gratitude to those dedicated individuals who put themselves at risk, day after day, in service to others and to our nation. The forceful measures that we as a country are taking to control the spread of the virus have brought much of the economy to an abrupt halt. Many businesses have closed, people have been asked to stay home, and basic social interactions are greatly curtailed. People are putting their lives and livelihoods on hold, at significant economic and personal cost. All of us are affected, but the burdens are falling most heavily on those least able to carry them. It is worth remembering that the measures we are taking to contain the virus represent an investment in our individual and collective health. As a society, we should do everything we can to provide relief to those who are suffering for the public good. While many standard economic statistics have yet to catch up with the reality we’re experiencing, it’s clear that the effects on the economy are severe. Millions of workers are losing their jobs: Next week’s jobs report is expected to show that the unemployment rate, which was at 50-year lows just two months ago, has surged into double digits. Household spending has plummeted as people stay home, and measures of consumer sentiment have fallen precipitously. Hotels, airlines, restaurants, department stores, and other retailers have been particularly hard hit. Manufacturing output fell sharply in March and is likely to drop even more reflecting weaker demand as well as significantly lower energy prices. Both the depth and the duration of the economic downturn are extraordinarily uncertain and will depend in large part on how quickly the virus is brought under control. The severity of the downturn will also depend on the policy actions taken at all levels of government to cushion the blow and to support the recovery when the public health crisis passes. The Federal Reserve’s response is guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people, along with our responsibilities to promote the stability of the financial system. We are also committed to using our full range of tools to support the economy in this challenging time. Last month we quickly lowered our policy interest rate to near zero. We stated then and again today that we expect to maintain interest rates at this level until we’re confident that the economy has weathered recent events and is on track to achieve our maximum-employment and price-stability goals. Of course, lowering interest rates cannot stop the sharp drop in economic activity caused by closures and other forms of social distancing. And low rates will not effectively spur the economy if those rates do not feed through to broader financial conditions or if households and businesses are unable to get credit. The economic disruptions caused by the virus created tremendous strains in some essential financial markets and have impaired the flow of credit in the economy. Without access to credit, families can be forced to cut back on necessities and could lose their homes. Businesses can be forced to downsize or close, resulting in further losses of jobs and incomes and worsening the downturn. Preserving the flow of credit is thus essential for mitigating the To support the flow of credit to households and businesses, foster smooth market functioning, and promote effective transmission of monetary policy to broader financial conditions, we have been purchasing large amounts of Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities. The markets for these securities play a critical role in the economy, and they came under great stress last month as the scale of economic disruption became clearer and as investors clamored for liquidity. Our purchases have helped market conditions improve substantially in recent weeks. In light of this improvement, we have slowed our pace of purchases. We will continue our purchases of Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities as needed. While the primary purpose of these securities purchases is to preserve smooth market functioning and effective policy transmission, the purchases will offer—will also foster more accommodative financial conditions. We are also undertaking programs to provide stability to the financial system and to more directly support the flow of credit in the economy—for households, for businesses of all sizes, and for state and local governments. These programs benefit the economy by providing financing where it is not otherwise available. In addition, by serving as a backstop to key credit markets, the programs can improve market functioning by increasing the willingness of private lenders to extend credit. Many of these programs rely on emergency lending powers that are available only in very unusual circumstances, such as those we find ourselves in today. We are deploying these lending powers to an unprecedented extent, enabled in large part by the financial backing and support from Congress and the Treasury. We will continue to use these powers I would stress that these are lending powers and not spending powers. The Fed cannot grant money to particular beneficiaries. We can only make loans to solvent entities that the— with the expectation that the loans will be repaid. Many borrowers will benefit from our programs, as will the overall economy. But for many others, getting a loan that may be difficult to repay may not be the answer. In these cases, direct fiscal support may be needed. Elected officials have the power to tax and spend and to make decisions about where we, as a society, should direct our collective resources. The Cares Act and other legislation provide direct help to people, businesses, and communities. This direct support can make a critical difference not just in helping families and businesses in a time of need, but also in limiting long-lasting damage to our economy. At the Fed, we’re doing all we can to help American families and businesses weather this difficult period. When the spread of the virus is under control, businesses will reopen, and people will come back to work. We will continue to use our tools to assure that the recovery, when it comes, will be as robust as possible. Thank you, and I’ll be glad to take your questions.","Opening Statement","Press Conf","","1099","2020-04"
"2020-04-29","So let me say that we’re—we’re committed to using our full range of tools to support the economy in this challenging time. We’re going to use them, as I mentioned, long as needed, we’ll use them. And I would just say, we have a number of dimensions on which we can still provide support to the economy. As you know, our credit policies are not subject to a specific dollar limit. They can be expanded as appropriate, and we can do new ones. So we can continue to be part of the answer. Will there be a need to do more, though? I think the answer to that—that will be “yes.” I would say, Congress has also reacted quite aggressively and strongly with the Cares Act and other laws—several other laws. And that’s appropriate. With enhanced unemployment insurance and the Paycheck Protection Program, we’ve seen an extraordinary, historically large reaction. But I would say that it may well be the case that the economy will need more support from all of us if the—if the recovery is to be a robust one.","Q&A","Press Conf","","182","2020-04"
"2020-04-29","So let me—let me start—I’ll take the questions in the order you— you gave them. So in terms of, if I can say, legislative priorities, we don’t—we’re not responsible for fiscal policy. Those will be decisions for Congress to make. But I would say that policies that protect workers, businesses, and households from avoidable insolvency, that keep businesses going so that they’re able to produce goods and—and to either hold on to their with less long-run damage to the economy. So that’s—that’s a key thing that—that, really, Congress could do over time. In terms of what we can do, I mentioned, we have our—our credit facilities are—are wide open. We can do more on that front. In addition, you know, we’ve had—we’ve had extensive discussions, as I’ve mentioned—done a lot of thinking about what monetary policy might look like over—in coming months over a range of potential scenarios for the economy. We do think that our—our policy stance today is right where it should be for now. As you know, we cut rates to the effective lower bound, we—and we’ve said that we’ll keep them there until we’re confident that the economy has weathered the effects of the outbreak and is on track to achieve our goals. With asset purchases, we’re continuing to purchase Treasury securities and agency MBS in the amounts needed to support smooth market functioning. So we’re doing those things, and I would say that we’ll continue to use our tools as needs be.","Q&A","Press Conf","","247","2020-04"
"2020-04-29","So, let me say again, in terms of—of asset purchases and—and other measures, we—we do think our—our policy stance is appropriate now. We’ve had discussions, as I’ve mentioned, over time and done quite a bit of thinking about what we might do in the future. We think, for now, our policy stance is appropriate. We’re not going to change it now. And we’re really waiting to see more from the economy. There are a range of potential paths the economy could be on, and I think as—as the time approaches for—then we’ll—you know, we’ll address your first question, which is about asset purchases. So—but that’s not something we’re doing today. It’s—it’s something that we have talked about, and, you know, for now, we like our current policy stance. In terms of risk, so, you know, we operate under the laws that Congress passes. And there are a number of aspects under section 13(3), and you can see that they’ve permitted us to, I think, move very quickly and move into areas where we’ve never been before and do so quite aggressively. So I—I think we’re going places and providing help in places where we never have, and I’m glad that we are. I think it’s appropriate that we are. Nonetheless, these are lending powers. And if you read section 13(3) of the Dodd- Frank—or, the Federal Reserve Act, and I know you have, it does require that—that we be secured to our satisfaction, and—and we can’t lend to insolvent companies. You know, it’s clear these are lending powers, and we are—we are ultimately bound to—to implement the laws that Congress gives us. We—we do not make grants. We can’t make grants. And I—the reason I raised that in my remarks is that I just want to be clear on that. will be at it with—with the legal authorities that we have until we get through this thing. We will keep using our authorities. But there are authorities that we don’t have, and there may be a need for those authorities to be used as well as ours.","Q&A","Press Conf","","347","2020-04"
"2020-04-29","Sure. So, in terms of those facilities, the corporate credit facilities are near being finalized and will be operating, I would say, soon—fairly soon. Main Street facility is—we’re close to announcing—to issuing a new term sheet. As you know, we put out a term sheet for comment a while back, and we got a couple thousand comments. We’ve carefully studied them. We’ve tried to reflect those in what we’re doing now. I think, with Main Street, there’ll be at least a couple of different kinds of lending going on there. It—this is a broad area of the economy with many different kinds of credit needs, so we’re going to keep at that for some time, I think, adding in sectors and lending products. So I think we’ll be at—we’ll In terms of our statement, so what we said was that we—I’ll just read the sentence. It says: “[The] ongoing public health crisis will weigh heavily on economic activity, employment, and inflation in the near term and poses considerable risks to the economic outlook over the medium term.” So the “medium”—but what we meant by that, “over the medium term”—so, obviously, what we’re talking about is, you know, not right now, in the very near term. It’s between now and the long term, so the next year or so. And I would point to a couple of—of risks to the outlook that—what we were thinking of. First is just the virus. How long will it take to get it under control? Will there be additional outbreaks? Will there be drugs that can either treat it or—or a vaccine of some kind? So there’s—all of that is very much shrouded in uncertainty. The second issue—and this is a very substantial one—is just the possibility of—of damage to the productive capacity of the economy through a couple of channels. The first is just workers who—if one is unemployed for an extended period, that person can—can lose the skills that are needed, can lose touch with the labor force, and have difficulty restarting his or her career. So that’s a—that’s a feature of deep and long recessions, and that’s something we’ve got to watch out for. Another is just businesses—you know, these thousands of great medium- and small-sized businesses that we have all over the country. They’re worth so much more to the economy than the sum of their net assets. They contain—you know, they’re job creators, they’re really important. And if we see an unnecessary—unnecessary insolvencies, a wave of those, that could be damaging to the performance of the economy over time. So the good news is that we The third thing I would point to is just the global dimension. This is a very global phenomenon, and you are—we’re seeing economic data from around the globe which is very, very negative, and that, too, can weigh on","Q&A","Press Conf","","475","2020-04"
"2020-04-29","Okay. So on the first, as I mentioned, you know, we moved very quickly, very aggressively. We were the first to return to the effective lower bound, where we are now. We got there essentially right away, and we think that’s the right place to be. We think, if you look at surveys, you look at market pricing, the market expects us to—to be there for a good while, and that’s appropriate. So, you know, it’s not as though the market is pricing in a near-term liftoff or anything like that. And let me just say, we’re going to not be in any hurry to withdraw these measures or to lift off. We’re going to wait until we’re—we’re quite confident that the economy is—is well on the road to recovery. So we don’t see—we see our current stance and our current guidance—and I would say the same thing about asset purchases—we see them as appropriate. I’ve—I’ve also mentioned now a couple times that we have done a lot of thinking about what monetary policy might look like over coming months, and that would, you know, depend on—on where we are in—in a range of potential economic scenarios. So we—we were thinking about that all the time, but right now, for now, we think our current stance is appropriate. So we made no change in it today. Second question was, how—so the thing about our facilities is, Treasury still has plenty of equity. So we’ve said that if—if demand for our facilities is greater than we’ve estimated, then we’ll expand them. And we have the ability to do that. So it won’t be the way the—the Paycheck Protection Program is, where there’s a specific amount allocated—appropriated for it, and—and then there’s no more money. That’s—that will be unlikely to happen here unless we exhaust Treasury’s equity, and we’re a long way from doing that. we build confidence in the market. And private market participants come in. And many companies that would’ve had to come to the Fed have now been able to finance themselves privately since we announced the—the initial term sheet on—on these facilities. So that’s a good thing. Companies are out there financing, they’re out there raising liquidity. We haven’t made any corporate loans to—in those facilities. We’ve made the short-term money market loans, but—we haven’t made any of them. And yet there’s a tremendous amount of financing going on, and that’s a good thing. So we—for that reason, the ultimate demand for the facilities is quite difficult to predict, because there is this announcement effect that really gets the market functioning again. Of course, we have to follow through, though. And we will follow through to validate that—that announcement effect.","Q&A","Press Conf","","452","2020-04"
"2020-04-29","You know, as you know, economic forecasts are always uncertain. Today they’re unusually uncertain, and that’s—that’s really because so much of the performance of the economy depends on the path of the virus and the success of the measures we take to things either, but what the experts tell us is that the outcomes are highly uncertain. So this is an unusual, new kind of uncertainty added on top of our—our regular uncertainty. But I—I will say, there—I think there are a few things that you can say about—about the path ahead. First, this time, now, is going to be a time of sharp contraction in economic activity, high unemployment. Personal consumption expenditures have declined sharply, business investment as well. Unemployment moved up. We’re going to see economic data for the second quarter that’s worse than any data we’ve seen for the economy. And they’re a direct consequence of the disease and the measures that we’re taking to protect ourselves from it. So then we will enter this new phase, and we—we’re just beginning to maybe do that, where we will—formal measures that require social distancing will be rolled back gradually and at different paces in different parts of the country. And, in time, this—during this period, the economy will begin to recover. People will come out of their homes, start to spend again. We’ll see unemployment go down, we’ll see economic activity pick up. And, you know, when will that be? It’s very hard to say. But let’s just say, for this purpose, that it’s in the third quarter. So, as I mentioned earlier, that—that could be a fairly, you know, a large increase. Given the— given the size of the fall, the increase could also be substantially large, although it’s unlikely that it would bring us quickly, quickly all the way back to pre-crisis levels. Of course, this is the period as well that carries the risk of new outbreaks of the virus, something we really want to avoid. I think then, after that period, at some point you will have—you know, the kind of formal social-distancing measures will—will be gone, but you’ll still be left with, probably, a level of the sooner we get the virus under control, the sooner people can regain that confidence and regain their economic activity. I think trying to be really precise about when that might happen and what the numbers might look like is—I think it’s very tough to do that.","Q&A","Press Conf","","410","2020-04"
"2020-04-29","So a couple things. This is different from the PPP, the Paycheck Protection Program, in two ways. One is, these are not grants, these are loans. So I don’t know that the demand will be quite as strong as—as it has been for the","Q&A","Press Conf","","44","2020-04"
"2020-04-29","So we think that low interest rates affect the economy through a number of channels in a positive way. Lower interest rates support economic activity through channels that we—overall, through channels that we understand reasonably well. They make it cheaper to borrow, they make—they drive, you know, your costs of borrowing down. They do—they do raise asset prices, including the value of your home. If your saver owns a home or has a 401(k), your saver will benefit from that. But for people who are really, really just relying on their bank savings account earnings, this is—you know, that’s—that’s—you’re not going to benefit from low interest rates. But we—you know, we have to look out for the overall economy. Low interest rates support employment, they support economic activity, and those are our mandates. And I think for the overall good of the economy, low interest rates are a good thing. And that’s not to say they’re good for every single person, but that shouldn’t stop us from doing what we think is—is good for the whole. In terms of how low, I really don’t want to speculate. You know, we will turn to questions like that soon enough. But the—in terms of how long we’ll stay and under what conditions we’ll stay at the effective lower bound, those are just exactly the things we’re thinking about. Right now we like the place we are. We’ve said that we’ll keep our rates where they are until we’re confident that the economy has weathered the effects of the outbreak and is on track to achieve our—our goals. So that’s where we are. We’re leaving—we’re not changing that","Q&A","Press Conf","","275","2020-04"
"2020-04-29","Sure. So unemployment’s going to go up to a high number in the second quarter—uncertain what the number will be. When—and that’s because so much economic activity has been shuttered, really, as we take social-distancing measures. And the— so sometime fairly soon here, and probably gradually and at different paces at different parts of the country, we’ll see the social-distancing measures rolled back. People will begin to spend more money. It’s, really, consumer spending has fallen precipitously. And once that starts to happen, people will get hired back and unemployment will go back down. I don’t think it’ll get maximum employment. But, I mean, the main thing we want is, we want to get back on that road. We want to get that—that recovery going and get people back to work as fast as we can. Not faster than we can, but as fast as we can. The main thing is to get into that stage where the economy’s healing, where we have the disease under control, where we don’t, you know, take too much risk of—of second and third waves and that sort of thing, and get people back to work. And, you know, it’s—again, the path of it is highly uncertain, but we will—we will be there with our tools, supporting the economy and supporting that recovery.","Q&A","Press Conf","","219","2020-04"

"2020-04-29","In terms of inflation, we think that inflation is very closely and strongly related to inflation expectations. And during the Global Financial Crisis, there was a concern that we might see deflation, but it didn’t happen. Inflation expect—inflation tended to move down a little bit, as it will when demand is weak. And—but inflation expectations did not move strongly down here in the United States. They have in other places in the world, though, over the past 25 years. There’s been downward pressure on inflation, really, for several decades now. So, I would say, as long as inflation expectations remain anchored, then we shouldn’t see deflation. And the Federal Reserve is strongly committed to maintaining 2 percent inflation over time. So we’ll be there to work on that. I think you asked, really, about headline inflation. If— if low energy prices—very low energy prices were to—were to drop headline inflation negative, I—I would hope that people would see through that—and we’ll be monitoring it very carefully— would see through it, though, and look to core, which is a better predictor of future inflation. So, needless to say, we’ll be keeping very close track of that. In terms of the markets, you know, our—our concern is that they be working. We’re not—we’re not focused on the level of asset prices in particular, it’s just—markets are trying to price in something that is so uncertain as to be unknowable, which is the path of this virus globally and its effect on the economy. And that’s very, very hard to do. That’s why you see volatility the way it’s been, market reacting to—to things with a lot of volatility. But, you know, what we’re trying to assure, really, is that the market is working. The market is assessing risks, lenders are lending, borrowers are borrowing, asset prices are moving in response to events. see—that’s when you see, you know, very sharp negative—even more negative economic outcomes. So I think our measures have—have supported market function pretty well. You know, we’re going to stay very careful, carefully monitoring that. But I think it’s been good to see markets working again. Particularly, the flow of credit in the economy has been a positive thing, as businesses have been able to build up their liquidity buffers and households have been able to be home—you know, people have been home, you know, concerned about their jobs, but they’re not concerned about the financial system collapsing as they were in 2008 and ’09.","Q&A","Press Conf","","415","2020-04"

"2020-06-10","I would say that many forecasters had been expecting a bottom for the economy in—around the middle of the year, with—with a huge range of uncertainty. I think the labor market—the evidence of one jobs report is that the labor market may have hit bottom in May. We don’t know that; we’re going to see. And, you know, many forecasters widely expect a—a recovery over the second half of the year. So it—it is possible, but the thing is, we’re not going to overreact to a single data point. We’re going to be very careful about reaching any conclusions about—about good data or bad data. So, I think, you know, we’re going to be here with our tools supporting this economy for as long as it’s needed. So—but I think there’s a possibility that—that the bottom has come in the labor market, but we don’t know that yet. We’ll—we’ll know more as we go forward. So, in terms of the—you know, the effect of the pandemic on inequality, what you see— the pandemic, of course, hits everybody, but in an economic sense, it hits those industries that are—that involve groups of people in tight groups, either in places where they’re—it’s the travel, leisure, restaurant, bars, those kinds of service-economy jobs. And so a lot of the lost jobs were from people who work in the service economy, dealing with the public, for example, and relatively—compared to other jobs, relatively low wages. So, and if—if you just look at what percentage in the workforce. So that’s really—really, really unfortunate, because if you just go back two months, where we were was, we had, effectively, the first tight labor market in a quarter-century. And for the last couple of years before the pandemic hit, you were seeing wages go up the most for people at the lower end of the wage spectrum, and that was great. And, you know, we were meeting with people from low- and—low- and moderate-income communities all over the country and hearing, “Don’t change this. Do whatever you—do whatever you can. Keep this going. This is the best labor market we’ve seen.” And we had every expect—every expectation, every reason to expect that this would continue, and then this comes. So it’s—it’s heartbreaking, and, you know, we want to get it back, so—we really want to get it back. And so I think we learned a number of things over the course of the last few years. One of them is that, you know, I—you—you can have 3, 3½ percent unemployment for a couple of years, and, really, you see modest moves in wages and relatively almost invisible moves in inflation. So that was not anybody’s understanding of the structure of the economy, I think, or most peoples’, anyway. So we can use our tools to—to support the labor market and support the economy. We can—we can use them until we do fully recover, and that—that’s what we’re planning to do. You know, we don’t target different groups. What—what we are—we are cognizant of the fact, though, that late in the last cycle, late in the last expansion, the benefits really do go more to people at the lower end of the wage spectrum for—for the first time in many years when labor","Q&A","Press Conf","","545","2020-06"
"2020-06-10","What we’ve targeted is broader financial conditions. If you go back to the end of February and early March, you had—basically, the world markets realized at just about the same time—I remember that Monday—that there was going to be a global pandemic, and that this possibility that it would be contained in one province in China, for all practical purposes, was not going to happen. It all—it was—you know, it was Iran, Italy, Korea, and then it became clear in markets. From that point forward, investors everywhere in the world, for a period of weeks, wanted to sell everything that wasn’t cash or a—a short-term Treasury instrument. They didn’t want it to have any risk at all. And so what happened is, markets stopped working. They stopped working, and companies couldn’t—couldn’t borrow. They couldn’t roll over their debt. People couldn’t borrow. So that’s—that’s the kind of situation that So what our tools were—were put to work to do was to restore the markets to function. And I think, you know, some of that has really happened, as I—as I mentioned in my opening remarks, and that’s a good thing. So we—we’re not looking to achieve a particular level of any asset price. What we want is investors to be pricing in risk like markets are supposed to do. Borrowers are borrowing. Lenders are lending. We want the markets to be working. And, again, we’re not looking to—to a particular level. I think our—our principal focus, though, is on—on the state of the economy and on the labor market and on inflation. Now, inflation, of course, is—is low, and we think it’s very likely to remain low for some time, below our target. So, really, it’s about getting the labor market back and getting it in shape. That’s—that’s been our major focus. And I would say, you know, we—if we were to hold back because—we would never do this, but—the idea that, just the concept that we would hold back because we think asset prices are too high—others may not think so, but we just decided that that’s the case—what would happen to those people? You know, what would happen to the people that we’re actually legally supposed to be serving? We’re supposed to be pursuing maximum employment and stable prices, and that’s what we’re pursuing. We’re also pursuing financial stability, but there you have a banking system that is so much better capitalized, so much stronger, better aware of its risks, better at managing its risks, more highly liquid. You have all of those things. And they’ve been lending. They’ve been taking in deposits. They’ve been a source of strength in this situation. all. It’s just we want markets to be working, and I think, partly as a result of what we’ve done, they—they are working. And, you know, we hope that continues. Thank you very much.","Q&A","Press Conf","","477","2020-06"
"2020-06-10","We do. We do track all unemployment by all kinds, as you know— all kinds of different demographics, including particularly the African American unemployment rate, which reached an all-time low since the data started being kept in the modern era. Of course, it’s still close to twice the white unemployment—it is twice the unemployment rate, or it was back in the—back then. It’s certainly much higher now. You know, the—the best thing we can do with our monetary policy tools is to—is to look at, you know, the evidence of what we saw—that we saw with our own eyes so recently, which is that the economy can have very low unemployment—very low unemployment. It could’ve inflation back up to target—without seeing wages getting out of touch with—with where they should be, so that’s the—that’s the biggest thing we can do.

"2020-06-10","I don’t have a reliable estimate of that. Clearly, not everyone will go back. But—and I—I would say, many will go back, but what’s—what’s going to be the remainder when—you know, when we reach sort of what is the new normal? It’s—it’s so uncertain, but it—it could be a good number of millions of people, I think, in many—in many estimates, but these—I’d say you’re so early in the process. People are—for example, people are going back and looking at other significant changes in the economy, and they’ve seen how many people go back when, for example, there’s a technological change, and things like that—you may have seen some of this research—and you come up with an estimate. I—you know, it’s just going to be very hard to say. I—I, but I—my—my assumption is that there will be a significant chunk—chunk well into the millions. I—I don’t want to give you a number, because it’s going to be a guess, but well, well into the millions of people who—who don’t get to go back to their old job. And, in fact, there isn’t a—there may not be a job in that industry for them for some time. There will the fastest way, is—is they know other people in that industry, different kinds of jobs. That’s usually the fastest. If you have to go to a different industry and start over again, it’s much harder, and that’s where you start to lose people’s—who are—just fall out of the labor force. And—and, you know, it’s very tough on their lives.

"2020-06-10","In terms of the way—the way we do forecasts is, we—we don’t— the—we don’t tend to incorporate things we’re highly uncertain about. So I think the—the forecast would not have included substantial additional—you know, big additional fiscal support for the economy. Maybe—maybe a modest amount, something that looks like a—a low-end guess on what might come out of the current negotiations. That’s basically what would be in the baseline. So, of course, if there were more fiscal support, you’d see—you’d see better results sooner, but that’s a question for Congress. You know, we’re—we’re spending a lot, and that’s really what they get to decide. In terms of Main Street and our willingness to expand it further, I think we’re—one thing we’re looking at—very strongly looking at is—is nonprofits, and is there a way to—to incorporate them into—into that facility or a similar facility. So that’s another dimension. I— learn more, it could be—it could be in terms of size, it could be in terms of lots of different things. But I—I think we have a good product to go to market with now, and I think it’ll get— it’ll get out there soon.

In terms of the timing of these things, so, you know, we’ll leave them open as—we’ll leave them open for new loans as long as they need to.

"2020-06-10","I can’t offer any advice, but I will provide a little context for the— for—I want to be clear about the picture—one way to look at the picture, really, and that is this: You can—you can get at this by looking at, you know, the—the—the widest measure of unemployment, of labor market slack, if you will, is the U-6 measure. And the U—that’s the— the one we look—talk about all the time is called U-3, by economists. And the—the one that has a much broader measurement of slack in the economy is U-6. So in—in—in U-6, the U-6 level of unemployment has tripled from 7 percent to 21 percent. That—that amounts to 22 million additional people who are—who’ve—who’ve lost work in the economy either by going to part time or something like that. So that’s in the low 20s, and that’s post the May employment report. You can get at it a different way. You can look at—at just the regular unemployment rate. You can take the 21 [million]—people who have—had—are listed as unemployed right now. You can add more on for the ones who were miscoded. You can also take those people who are suddenly out of the labor force. You put those together, and that has gone up by about 24 million. So those are two different measures of what’s happened. So the question is, 20, 22, 24 million people—got to get them back to work. Somehow, we’ve got to all, as a country, get those people back to work. They didn’t do anything wrong; this was a natural disaster, and I—I really—I do think the responses so far have been great. So that’s the way I would think about it. And if—if you think we—I would just, in terms of the May employment report, it’s—it’s so nice to see. I mean, I think what people were thinking was that you’d start to get those back- to-work kind of numbers in June and July and August. Very few people saw them in May. I mean, almost no one saw that happening as early as mid-May, but it did. And so, you know, and mentioned earlier, it is clear evidence of just how uncertain things are, and—and how humble we have to be about our ability to—to really have confident predictions as opposed to just predictions. So, bottom line, I would just say, that—that—the key thing people need to understand is that there’s just a lot of work to do in the labor market. We’re going to stick with this and support that until the work is done. That you—you can—that is something we’re going to do with all of our tools, and I think it may require Congress to help as well. It may, but that’s going to be their decision. On—you also asked about the second wave. So we—you know, we have major responsibilities and powerful tools, but the decision about when to reopen the economy is one for elected officials at the state and local and federal level. And, you know, if they ask, we—we don’t have any particular expertise here at the Fed in pandemics or coronaviruses or anything like that. We talk to experts, but—you know, so we don’t have anything special to add on that. I would just say, it’s—you know, it’s kind of self evident, I think, that if a—if it happens, you know, the—the issue would be, first of all, people’s health, but secondly, you could see a public loss of confidence in—in parts of the economy that will be already slow to recover. So it could hurt the recovery even if you don’t have a national-level pandemic, just a—just a series of—of local ones, of local spikes could—could have the effect of undermining people’s confidence in traveling, in restaurants and entertainment, anything that involves getting people together in small groups and feeding them or flying them around—those things could be hurt. So it would not be a positive development, and I’ll just leave it at that. Street lending facilities, you know, in May we saw 55—at least 55 companies file for bankruptcy. Do you think that it is too late, first of all? Second of all, the future of these facilities—is this a one-year impact to the economy through these facilities, or is this a multiple-year? If so, how many years?","Q&A","Press Conf","","721","2020-06"
"2020-06-10","Chris, this is a really important risk. And I think it’s—it’s not the risk for the next few months, but it’s the risk over time of—of lasting damage to the—to these— you know, to the productive capacity of the United States, typically in two forms. One, through extended periods of unemployment, people lose contact with the labor force. They get out of touch with the skills and—that they need, and—and they have a hard time getting back in, and that drives that—that, you know, it’s very damaging to people’s lives and their working lives. And it also just lowers, in a way—it can—it can increase the—you know, the unemployment rate, but it can also lower the labor force participation rate, which is almost worse, in a way, to have people dropping out of the labor force where we need them in the—in the labor force working. The other piece of it is just businesses. You know, a shock like this that just comes in, it’s like a natural disaster. You wouldn’t want a lot of perfectly good businesses, particularly the smaller and medium-sized businesses that may not have a lot of resources to sustain them to— you know, to go out of business permanently in a situation like that—like this where, really, there was no reason for it. Of course, you know, businesses are going to go in and out. They’re going to fail all the time, and that’s a healthy thing in capitalism. That’s something that has to We didn’t change. You—you’re right, though. We didn’t change our longer-run estimate of—of potential growth or of the unemployment rate. And that’s—I would say, in my thinking, the reason I didn’t change mine is that I still—I—I think we can avoid that or avoid much of that, most of that even. And—and we do that with measures that—that, you know, keep people in their homes; that—that support hiring; that support growth; that avoid unnecessary, avoidable business insolvencies. And that’s all the things that we’re trying to do. Basically, if you look at what’s happened, as I mentioned, there’s something—somewhere short of 25 million people have been displaced, even after the good May employment report. What we’re trying to do is create an environment in which they have the best chance either to go back to their old job or to get a new job. That’s—that’s kind of the most important part of this exercise. And maybe these—it’s probably hopeful at this point to say that—that we won’t have longer-run damage to the economy, and these numbers won’t change. So—but I think it’s way too early to be—to be changing the longer run—see, these are—these are not meant to be short- run numbers. They’re called—they’re longer-run assessments, so I—I would—I have not changed mine, and I’m hopeful that—that I won’t have to change it.","Q&A","Press Conf","","472","2020-06"
"2020-06-10","I don’t think that the—that the Great Depression is a good example or a likely outcome or a model for what’s happening here at all. I really don’t. And there—there are just so many fundamental differences. First, the government response has been so fast and so forceful. The origin was quite different. This was a very—an economy that was in a healthy place. Of course, every economy has longer-run challenges, not—and that—that includes our economy, notwithstanding that 50-year low in unemployment and the longest expansion in our was in—was in very good shape, much better capitalized. So, you know, it’s just not the right model. I would say, we’re learning. You know, every month that passes, we’re seeing more, we’re learning more. And I think particularly the next few months will be very important in learning what the—what the real story will be, because we’ll see the—the significant incoming data about the opening of the economy—the reopening of the economy. You know—and I would say, assuming that the—that the—that the disease remains or becomes pretty much under control, I think that what you see is a—is a very weak second quarter, historically weak, and then an—an expansion that builds momentum over time. People will adjust, probably a little bit gradually, to some of the activities that would— that involve getting together in small—in large groups in close quarters. Those will be the harder parts of the economy to recover. But, ultimately, we do see a full recovery over time. And that’s really what, you know, what I think I’m—I’m personally seeing. And you could see significant job growth in—in coming months as people return to their jobs, but you’re still going to face probably an extended period where it will be difficult for many people to find work. And for—and that’s what you see in—in—in, really, many, many forecasts at this point. That doesn’t mean it’s right, but that’s sort of a—a broad expectation, certainly not the Depression forecast.","Q&A","Press Conf","","329","2020-06"
"2020-06-10","I would start with—that’s where I would start.

And during that period of time, we saw a lot of great things happening in the labor market, things that we’d love to get back to. We didn’t see any problems with price inflation. Price inflation didn’t really react on—on unemployment just based on what we—what we saw in the last—in the last expansion. So, you know, we’re—we’re not thinking about raising rates. We’re not even thinking about thinking about raising rates. So what we’re thinking about is—is providing support for this economy. We do think this is going to take some time. I think most forecasters believe that. It would be great if—if we got a whole bunch more months of job creation like that. Not— notwithstanding that, as I mentioned, there are—there are just a lot of people that are unemployed.

"2020-06-10","Our current policy stance is appropriate. And remember, we’re using—we’re using our—our emergency 13(3) lending tools to an unprecedented extent. We have asset purchases, and we’ve now said that we won’t go any lower than this, and—but—but that we’re prepared to adjust as appropriate, and rates are at the effective lower bound. So we have all of our tools in—in use in a strong way. And so what we’re—what we’re waiting for is to—is to learn more. I—I think, actually, if you look at the May employment report, it’s a pretty good—probably the biggest data surprise that anybody can remember. It’s a pretty good illustration of just how uncertain these times are. The economy is reopening. We’re going to learn a whole lot about the—the path of the economy in the next—in coming months. So that’s really what we’re—what we’re looking for. In terms of inflation, you’ll know that we—we had a 128-month expansion, and we never did quite get inflation back to 2 percent on a symmetric, sustained basis. We got close for the last couple of years, but we never did quite get there. So I think we have to be humble about our ability to move inflation up and particularly when unemployment is—is going to be above most estimates of the natural rate for—certainly above the median in our—in our—in our SEP well through the end of—past the end of 2022. So I do—I think we’re in the right place now. We— achieve our goals in the best possible way? And I’ll—I’ll just say again that we are—the—the May employment report, of course, was a—was a welcome surprise, very pleased. We hope we get many more like it. But I think we have to be honest. It’s a—it’s a long road. It’s—it’s, depending on how you count it, well more than 20 million people displaced in the labor market. It’s going to take some time. And we are going to be deploying our tools—all of our tools, to their full extent, in pursuit of that—of those goals, however long it takes.","Q&A","Press Conf","","344","2020-06"
"2020-06-10","So, first, I would say that we think that monetary policy today is currently well positioned to support the economy in this challenging time. If we didn’t think that, of course, we would change our policy now. As you know, we—we lowered our policy rate achieve our goals. You can see that in—in the dot plot, as I think you pointed out, that overwhelmingly, FOMC participants expect, as their baseline expectation, no rate increase at least through 2022. And if you look at surveys of more forecasters and market participants, financial market prices, et cetera, those also appropriately reflect a long spell with rates at the effective lower bound. So the first thing is, monetary policy is in a good place, and it’s—that’s well understood in the markets. Secondly, we’ve also taken strong measures to support the flow of credit in the economy, as I mentioned. And, third, we’re continuing asset prices in coming months at—at a— at a relatively high level.1 So for all those reasons, we feel like policy is now in a good place. So as we look ahead, we see that the path for the—ahead for the economy is highly uncertain and continues to depend to a really significant degree on the path of the pandemic. So, at this meeting, what we did was, as I mentioned, we—we looked in some depth at forward guidance and asset purchases and looked carefully at those. We also received a briefing on the historical experience with yield curve control. And we’ll continue those discussions in upcoming meetings and evaluate our stance and communications as more and portion—more— more information about the trajectory of the economy becomes available. I—I would just say, in terms of—of what we’re looking for, we—we expect to get a better understanding of the economy’s trajectory and, particularly, how we should best deploy those tools to achieve those goals. So that’s really what we’re looking to achieve, and, as you can see, we’re—we’re actively at work on that. 1 Chair Powell intended to say “asset purchases” rather than “asset prices.” I’m—I’m curious about your inflation forecasts, which are—are pretty low across the forecast horizon. I guess just given how low you see inflation being over the coming years, why is policy appropriate now, and why not just kind of throw everything you can—you know, everything and the kitchen sink at it currently? And I guess if you could just talk a little bit about what urgency you see in—in returning it back to that 2 percent target.","Q&A","Press Conf","","421","2020-06"
"2020-06-10","Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Our country continues to face a difficult and challenging time, as the pandemic is causing tremendous hardship here in the United States and around the world. People have lost loved ones. Many millions have lost their jobs. There is great uncertainty about the future. At the Federal Reserve, we are strongly committed to using our tools to do whatever we can—and for as long as it takes—to provide some relief and stability, to ensure that the recovery will be as strong as possible, and to limit lasting damage to the economy. The most important response to this crisis has come from our health-care workers. And on behalf of the Federal Reserve, let me express our sincere gratitude to those dedicated individuals who put themselves at risk, day after day, in service to others and to our nation. Let me also thank the many other essential workers across the country who have helped meet our basic needs for goods and services in these difficult times. The virus and the forceful measures taken to control its spread have induced a sharp decline in economic activity and a surge in job losses. Indicators of spending and production plummeted in April, and the decline in real GDP in the current quarter is likely to be the most severe on record. Even after the unexpectedly positive May employment report, nearly 20 million jobs have been lost on net since February, and the unemployment rate has risen about 10 percentage points, to 13.3 percent. As was highlighted by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, this figure likely understates the extent of unemployment; accounting for the unusually large number of workers who reported themselves as employed but absent from their jobs would raise the unemployment rate by about 3 percentage points. The downturn has not fallen equally on all Americans, and those least able to shoulder the burden have been the most affected. In In recent weeks, some indicators suggest a stabilization or even a modest rebound in some segments of the economy, such as retail merchandise and motor vehicle sales. Employment rose in many sectors of the economy in May, and the unemployment [rate] edged down as some workers returned to their jobs from temporary layoffs. With the easing of social- distancing restrictions across the country, people are increasingly moving about, and many businesses are resuming operations to varying degrees. At the same time, many households have been receiving stimulus payments and unemployment benefits, which are supporting incomes and spending. Activity in many parts of the economy has yet to pick up, however, and overall output is far below earlier levels. Moreover, despite the improvements seen in the May jobs report, unemployment remains historically high. Weak demand, especially in sectors most affected by the pandemic, is holding down consumer prices. As a result, inflation has fallen well below our symmetric 2 percent objective. Indicators of longer-term inflation expectations have been fairly steady. The extent of the downturn and the pace of recovery remain extraordinarily uncertain and will depend in large part on our success in containing the virus. We all want to get back to normal, but a full recovery is unlikely to occur until people are confident that it is safe to reengage in a broad range of activities. The severity of the downturn will also depend on the policy actions taken at all levels of government to provide relief and to support the recovery when the public health crisis passes. The Fed’s response is guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people, along with our responsibilities to promote the stability of where we expect to keep it until we are confident that the economy has weathered recent events and is on track to achieve our maximum-employment and price-stability goals. We have also been taking broad and forceful actions to support the flow of credit in the economy. Without access to credit, families could be forced to cut back on necessities or even lose their homes. Businesses could be forced to downsize or close, resulting in further losses of jobs and incomes and worsening the downturn. Preserving the flow of credit is thus essential for mitigating the damage to the economy and setting the stage for the recovery. Since March, we have been purchasing sizable quantities of Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities in order to support the smooth functioning of these markets, which are vital to the flow of credit in the economy. Our ongoing purchases have helped to restore orderly market conditions and have fostered more accommodative financial conditions. As market functioning has improved since the strains experienced in March, we have gradually reduced the pace of these purchases. To sustain smooth market functioning and thereby foster the effective transmission of monetary policy to broader financial conditions, we will increase our holdings of Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities over coming months at least at the current pace. We will closely monitor developments and are prepared to adjust our plans as appropriate to support our goals. The Federal Reserve is also undertaking programs to provide stability to the financial system and to more directly support the flow of credit in the economy—for households, for businesses of all sizes, and for state and local governments. These programs benefit the economy by providing financing where it is not otherwise available. In addition, by serving as a in very unusual circumstances, such as these—those we find ourselves in today. We are deploying these lending powers to an unprecedented extent, enabled in large part by financial backing and support from Congress and from the Treasury. We will continue to use these powers forcefully, proactively, and aggressively until we’re confident that we are solidly on the road to recovery. When the time comes, after the crisis has passed, we will put these emergency tools back in the toolbox. I would stress that these are lending powers, not spending powers. The Fed cannot grant money to particular beneficiaries. We can only create programs or facilities with broad-based eligibility to make loans to solvent entity—entities with the expectation that the loans will be repaid. Many borrowers will benefit from these programs, as will the overall economy. But for many others, getting a loan that may be difficult to repay may not be the answer. In these cases, direct fiscal support may be needed. Elected officials have the power to tax and spend and to make decisions about where we, as a society, should direct our collective resources. The CARES Act and other legislation provide direct help to people and businesses and communities. This direct support can make a critical difference not just in helping families and businesses in a time of need, but also in limiting long-lasting damage to our economy. At this meeting, my colleagues and I continued our discussion of approaches for conducting monetary policy when the federal funds rate is at its lower bound. The measures we discussed included explicit forms of forward guidance and asset purchases. We used these tools in the aftermath of the Global Financial Crisis, and they have become a standard part of our toolkit. We also reviewed the historical and foreign experience with targeting interest rates evaluate our monetary policy stance and communications as more information about the trajectory of the economy becomes available. We also resumed our regular quarterly Summary of Economic Projections, or the","Opening Statement","Press Conf","","1236","2020-06"
"2020-06-10","There have been gains in market function, although not fully back to where you would say they were, for example, in—in February, before the pandemic arrived. We don’t take those gains for granted, though. This is a—this is a highly fluid situation, and we’re— we’re not taking those for granted. And, in addition, as I pointed out in my—in my statement, those purchases are clearly also supporting highly accommodative—or accommodative financial conditions, and that’s—that’s a good thing, so that’s why we’re doing that. Turning quickly to Main Street, so I would say that the thing—what we’ve done on Main Street, I think to a greater degree, is, we’ve listened to feedback. So we’ve been out repeatedly for feedback in trying to create a—a much more difficult product than, really, the other facilities. And I think this—this last set of changes we made have actually been very positive for the facility. I think it’s going to be better able to achieve its goals, and, you know, so we’ve used the time well, I think. And that—we are now in the—in the—in the final run-up to starting the facility. What we did, as you saw earlier—I guess it’s early this week or late, whenever we did it in the last few days—was we lowered the minimum loan size and we increased the maximum loan size. But, I think, even more importantly, we lengthened the maturity and we stretched out the repayment schedule significantly. So borrowers will get a—a two-year delay until they have to make any principal payments—repayments and a one-year delay on interest. So we had been hearing from The next step will be to register lenders. At that time, loans can begin to be made. Shortly after that, the facility itself will be up, and those facilities can be—those loans can be sold—95 percent of the loans. And it’s 95 percent across the board now in the Main Street facility can be sold. So all of that should happen quickly now. And I do think this has—this has been a challenging project, but I think we’ve come to a—to a better place. And, by the way, we’re—we’re going to be prepared to adapt further, if we need to. And—and that’s true of all of our facilities. These are unique. There’s no—there’s no playbook here. You—you have to draw this up and then try it out. And we’ve—we’ve been, you know, very willing to adapt and will continue to be.","Q&A","Press Conf","","409","2020-06"

"2020-07-29","Well, I—I think that the main thing that tells you is that the—the labor market has a long way to go to recover. You know, we had a good labor market. It wasn’t perfect. There were always issues. There are always going to be issues within an economy. But the labor market really has a long way to go now. Even with two very strong months of job creation—7½ million jobs between the two months—we still have 14 million people unemployed. So it’s just—it’s a long way to go. And as—and that leads to a situation where there are so many people looking for jobs, and we have the economy only partially reopened. So there aren’t, you know—until the economy—or as the economy fully reopens, people can go back to work, but—so it’s a tough situation. And I’ve read reports of that. You know, of course, the reported wages went up because of the composition effect—you know, it’s low-paid workers didn’t go back to work, so—they were the ones that got laid off—so average hourly earnings went up. But clearly, clearly the pressure—there will not be much upward pressure on wages and compensation at the aggregate labor force and—and to support those who are—who want to be in the labor force but whose jobs have gone away for some period of time as they find other work due to this natural disaster.","Q&A","Press Conf","","232","2020-07"
"2020-07-29","So—okay. So I think what the stress tests showed is that, under the “regular way” stress test, the banks passed. But right in the middle of the—of the stress test came the pandemic. And so we quickly dropped in three other scenarios, which were, you know, really bad scenarios. And many of the banks passed, but some didn’t. So we—and that was done very quickly. So we pivoted, and we used the provision that says we can—that says there’s been a material change, and we’re going to ask them to resubmit their capital plans. We also stopped buybacks—share buybacks and limited dividends. So we’re working through the details of how all of that will work. I think we’re going to—I think we’re going to send out the—the stress scenarios on September 30th. So, I would say, that’s—you know, that—that process is working that way. And—but you’re making a connection to it, to the Collins Amendment fix. So what’s going on there is that, like many other supervisors and regulators around the world, what we found is that our—we have found our banks are strong. They’re strongly capitalized, with lots of liquidity. And they’ve really been a source of strength in this—in this crisis so far. And they’ve written off bad loans and things like that. They’re still well capitalized and strong and will be, I think, a source of strength in this situation. balance sheet. So people put cash in—on deposit at the banks, and they reached the limit of how—how much they could grow or made loans—you know, they—companies drew down loans and deposited cash. So we gave some leverage ratio relief earlier by temporarily—it’s temporary relief—by eliminating, temporarily, Treasuries from the calculation of the—of the leverage ratio. This is a—this is another additional thing to do. If Congress chooses to do this, we would want it to be explicitly temporary. We—in other words, this will not be a permanent change in capital standards. We haven’t decided to do it, but it would give us the ability to allow banks to grow their balance sheet and, in doing so, to serve their customers better. And, you know, I have to tell you, if you look around the world, bank regulators—many, many bank regulators around the world have given leverage ratio relief. You know, Swiss National Bank, the Bank of Japan, the European Commission did, the Bank of Canada did, we did. It’s—it’s not, it’s not—what it’s doing is, it’s allowing them to grow their balance sheet in a way that serves their customers. That—that’s really what it’s doing. And, again, I would want it to be explicitly temporary if—if we do do it.","Q&A","Press Conf","","444","2020-07"
"2020-07-29","So that’s a great discussion that we—we’ve talked about that at past meetings, and I imagine we will at future meetings and haven’t made any decisions yet on that. But, you know, you’ve got a couple ways to go. You can tie—you can tie them to dates. You can say we will—for a specific period of time, we will keep rates at X level. Or you can say we’ll keep them there until you achieve a certain macroeconomic goal. And it can either be inflation or it could be an employment goal, as you pointed out. And I think that, you know, there’s attraction in all of those depending on the situation, I think, for obvious reasons. You can imagine situations where, you know, where you’d really want to be targeting macroeconomic outcomes. It’s also the case, though, that sometimes— sometimes date-based guidance works too. I think it really is very fact specific, and it’s not something we’ve—you know, we haven’t made any decisions on that, so I wouldn’t be standing here telling you we’re going to go this way or that way, you know, should the time come for us to—to change our forward guidance. the stimulus bill that Senate Republicans are considering, they’ve said that they’re weighing whether to revise the Collins Amendment in order to ease the tier 1 leverage ratio for banks. Are you concerned that doing so will deplete bank capital, given that the Fed’s stress tests showed that, under the most severe scenarios for economic recovery, that several banks would approach the regulatory minimum capital requirements?","Q&A","Press Conf","","262","2020-07"
"2020-07-29","The statute doesn’t say that, but, yeah, you could read the statute that way if you want. Honestly, we haven’t tried to push it to, you know, what’s the theoretical limit market has stopped functioning. That’s fundamentally what you’re doing with 13(3).

But, you know, we—we’re bound by the—by the provisions of 13(3), which requires that we make, you know, facilities—programs or facilities of broad applicability, meaning we have to have—it can’t just be focused on one entity. You know, it has to be a broad group of entities. There’s a lot in 13(3) about—about the solvency of the borrowers. You know, remember, it was rewritten or amended after the financial crisis, and it was written in a way that was—that was to—meant to make it challenging to bail out large financial institutions. That’s— there was a lot in there to make sure that, you know, that they were going to be solvent and things like that. So, you know, we have to meet those requirements. You know, we haven’t looked and said—tried to say, “What can we buy?” and, you know, “Let’s make a complete list.” You know, we felt that, using these facilities, that we could buy corporate bonds and—and municipal bonds, too. So—","Q&A","Press Conf","","187","2020-07"
"2020-07-29","So as I mentioned earlier, you know, we’re watching this high- frequency data. And, of course, the official labor market reports come out once a month, and no one has had a very good record lately of predicting what they’re going to say. They’ve been, in May and June, stronger than anybody expected, particularly in May. So I would say, some humility is appropriate here in terms of thinking we understand exactly where this is going. I think all we can say today is that there’s—there’s evidence in the high-frequency data, the surveys, and, you know, you’re tracking—you get pictures of spending. You get pictures of people’s movements. And what we—it looks like we’re seeing a slowdown in the rate of growth. That’s—and that might be—it might be short lived, it might not be, you know. And it seems to be related to—and the timing of it seems to be related to the spike in cases that began in the middle of June. Now, I really don’t want to get ahead of where the data are on this. So we’re just going to have to see. We’re going to have to—the data over the next couple of months will answer that question. And recent experience suggests we—we need to wait and see. In any case, there’s clearly a risk that we’re going to see a slowdown in the rate of growth in economic activity and in hiring. It might still be at a robust level. Honestly, we—we will not know until we start to see more data come in.","Q&A","Press Conf","","259","2020-07"
"2020-07-29","Okay. So, first, on the unemployment, you’re right. And we always point this out in our—in our remarks. While the aggregate unemployment rate was 3½ percent, every—every economy—every market in every economy has longer-run issues. And one of ours is just the disparate level of unemployment between—between Blacks and whites. And it’s generally sort of twice as much—twice as high for Blacks. So even—but this was the lowest, So we have started, though, in recent years to focus considerable time and attention on disparate levels of unemployment—for example, among—among different racial groups and demographic groups. We regularly discuss those differences in our FOMC discussions. We call them out in testimony and in speeches and in our Monetary Policy Report to Congress. You’ll see it everywhere, in all the things that we do. So what does that mean? I think—you know, I think what we learned is that a tight labor market really does a lot of good things for minorities and people at the lower end of the income spectrum generally. But it—you know, tight labor markets, it took 8 years—it took sort of the 8th and 9th and 10th years of that expansion to get to those benefits. So we need more than that. That’s not a good strategy, waiting 8, 9, 10 years to get there. So we’re—we’re going to get back there as fast as we can, because that’s what we can do, but society more broadly can affect these things. You know, we don’t really have tools that can address distributional, disparate outcomes as well as fiscal policy. And just policy generally—education, health care, all those things are much better at doing that. In terms of—so we do—you will see that—you will see that discussed—the Black unemployment rate discussed all the time in what we do. And I think we clearly understand now that it’s something to weigh when you get a tight labor market. It’s something that you want to be focused on and weigh. So it is very much in our thinking—again, in a world where we don’t really have the best tools to address that. So, something that we’re doing. So I have not seen that—I did not see that blog post yet, although someone did mention it to me. We, of course, have been in meetings until just before this. So, but—and I will take a been a lot of pain and injustice and unfair treatment that women have experienced in the workplace—not just among economists, but among economists and at the Fed. That’s been going on for far too long. And, you know, like every other organization, the Fed could have done more and—and should have done more. I would say, though, that we—you know, we have made it a very high priority to have as diverse and inclusive an organization as we can. And I think we’ve made a lot of progress on that. I think we want a place where it’s free to speak, where views are welcome, where people can disagree but must do so respectfully. I think a lot of organizations are coming around to understanding the importance of that. And I—my experience has been, you know, from my career in business too, is that organizations—the really successful organizations in our society get this. They do. They—mostly, they get it that if you want to attract the best people, this is what you—you’re going to attract the best people by having a diverse and inclusive workforce, so—and workplace. So we’ve made diversity a priority. We actually—you know, this has been a big issue for the economics profession. We had the—the two heads of the AEA task force on this—who happen to be named Ben Bernanke and Janet Yellen—come here, and I cohosted a—an event with them, I guess, last year or the year before, which had several hundred—500 people or something like that listening in about—about these issues. So we’re doing a lot. I’m sure we can do more. We’re doing a lot to—you know, to foster a respectful climate—particularly for women, but for—for all people. So it’s—it’s a very high priority for us as an organization. I will look into—into that and—when I—you know, when this is over. new hiring activity has weakened. I wonder, how big are the risks of the unemployment rate rising and job growth turning negative this summer?","Q&A","Press Conf","","726","2020-07"
"2020-07-29","So as I—as I said earlier, or a while back, we’re not even thinking about—thinking about raising rates. We’re—we’re totally focused on providing the economy the support that it will need. We think that the economy will need highly accommodative monetary policy and the use of our tools for an extended period. And we’re absolutely committed to staying in this until—until we’re very confident that that is no longer needed. So I wouldn’t look for us to be sending signals about cutting back on facilities or anything like that for a very long time. We’re—we’re in this until—until we’re well through it. of people are struggling to get back to work because those—those heavily affected areas of the economy are going to be challenged, really, to employ the millions of people who are now out of work. I think 14 million people are now out of work who were working in February, something like that. So that’s going to take a while, I think, in everyone’s reckoning. And I just—everyone should know that we’re going to be there for all of that.","Q&A","Press Conf","","182","2020-07"
"2020-07-29","So we—of course, the concept of vaccines comes up in our discussions. Of course it does. But I have to say, you know, we’re—our job is not to plan for the upside case, right? The upside case—we’ve got that covered. Our job is to plan for all—the full range of things that could happen. And so we’re assuming—we’re going to continue to assume that our facilities are needed, that our policies are needed, and that the public needs—you know, needs the support that we’re giving the public until—until shown otherwise. There’s great uncertainty around the development of therapeutics and vaccines. All of us want them to happen as soon as possible, but we can’t plan on that. We’ve got to hope for the worst—hope for the [laughs]—hope for the best and plan for the worst, I guess it goes. In terms of inflation, I don’t know. I mean, I—you know, I think, fundamentally, this is a disinflationary shock. I know there—there is a lot of discussion about how this might lead to inflation over time, but, you know, we’re—we’re seeing disinflationary pressures around the world going into this. Now we see a big shock to demand, and we see core inflation dropping to 1 percent. And I do think for quite some time we’re going to be struggling against disinflationary pressures rather than against inflationary pressures.","Q&A","Press Conf","","226","2020-07"

"2020-07-29","You know, I think we feel that it—it might be, the most central fact or the most central driver of the path of the economy right now is the virus. And you’re seeing that again now. You saw that in the—during the lockdown when we got cases way down, and that there is a slower pace of growth, at least for now. We don’t know how deep or how long that will be. So it’s such an important sentence. We just decided that it needed to be in our—in our postmeeting statement. It’s so fundamental. And, you know, I think we can’t say it enough. It’s—it’s really important. We’re—you know, you can think of it as three stages. There’s the lockdown, and we know what that looks like, and we’ll get the data, I guess, later this week on GDP being down very historically large amounts. Then there was the reopening, and we would expect that many, many people would go back to work. Those whose jobs could be done without—you know, without exposure to lots of people in tight groups, they should have been—they should be able to go back to work during that phase fairly quickly. But that would depend on being able to keep the virus under control, which will depend on wearing masks and other social-distancing measures. So that’s where we are. It’s such an important factor. It’s—it’s in—we’re all talking about it, so we thought it really had to be in the statement.","Q&A","Press Conf","","248","2020-07"
"2020-07-29","So, you know, as we’ve said, we’re carefully monitoring the situation. We moved very quickly and very aggressively early, and we’ve been monitoring the situation. And I think the markets and—and the economy—you know, I think our policy is in a good place. But we’ve looked at—at ways of adapting our policy as time goes by, and we’re ready to do that when we think it’s appropriate. I can’t give you a specific trigger.

I actually don’t remember exactly what I would have been talking with him about, but he’s a—you know, he’s the head of a major service provider. He generally checks in to find out whether we’re okay with the quality of the service that—that BlackRock is providing. I don’t have the daily face-to-face interaction with anybody else at BlackRock or—or, as you can see, three phone calls in the course of a few months. It wasn’t very many. So I think, you know, their conflicts are managed extremely carefully in the contractual arrangements we have with them. And, again, I would have—I—I can’t recall exactly what those conversations were, but they were—they would have been about what are you seeing in the markets and things like that too—you know, generally exchanging information.

"2020-07-29","So you’re right, the asset purchases in—in their current size really sprang from severe dysfunction in the Treasury and MBS markets at the beginning of the market reaction to the pandemic. And thanks to those purchases, we have substantially restored—not fully, but substantially restored functioning markets. This is absolutely critical. That market is really one of the—it’s part of the absolute bedrock of the global financial markets, and it’s—it’s essential that it—that it work well, and it is doing so now. And we’ve always said, though, that we understand, accept, and are fine with the fact that—that those purchases are also fostering a more accommodative stance of monetary policy, which would tend to support macroeconomic outcomes. So it’s doing both, and—and, you know, we’ve understood that for some time. It’s not—the programs are not structured exactly like the—the QE programs were in the last—in the last financial—in the aftermath of the last financial crisis. Those were more focused on buying longer-run securities. The current purchases are all across the—the maturity spectrum. Nonetheless, they are supporting accommodative financial conditions. I think it’s—it’s clear that that’s the case. In terms of our strategy, you know, that just remains to be seen. We—as you know, we’ve spent a lot of time in meetings this year looking at the tools that we have to adjust our current stance of policy. We do feel that our current monetary policy stance is the appropriate one. You know, we cut rates close to zero right at the beginning.

So you’re right that our facilities have not—we haven’t done as much lending as we thought. But, in very substantial measure, that’s because markets started working again fairly soon after we didn’t turn out to need the kind of funding that we thought we would. On the other hand, it’s important that the facilities stay in place, and that’s why we extended them yesterday. It’s important that they still stay in place until we’re, you know, very confident that the turmoil from the pandemic and the economic fallout are behind us. So I—I can’t really speak to what Congress should do with it, but it’s important that the facilities be there and be fully funded in case the needs do arise down the road. We don’t see them now, but, in case they do arise, they should be there.","Q&A","Press Conf","","162","2020-07"
"2020-07-29","Yeah. So maybe I’ll talk more broadly about the—the outlook and include your—include your question in it. So, as I mentioned, economic activity and employment picked up beginning in May and right through June and remained well below their levels because, I’d say, job gains have reversed about a third of the job losses from March and April, and consumer spending has reversed about a half of the drop. So—but, nonetheless, those were—those were sooner and stronger than we expected. So—but what happened then was, along with that positive data, we got—we got the virus increases starting in the middle of June in lots and lots of states around the country. And that brings us to a new—a new point here, which is, we need to—in addition to dealing with the health crisis—we have to remember, this is really a health crisis, and these are people who are having the coronavirus, and it’s taking a terrible toll, so we’ve got to deal with the economic ramifications of that. So what we’re seeing is that we monitor quite a lot of what we—what we think of as sort of nonstandard, high-frequency data. That’s become a very important thing, even more important than usual in the work that we do. And what that data show, on balance, is that the pace of the recovery looks like it has slowed since the cases began that spike in June. So some measures of consumer spending based on credit card and debit card data have moved down. Recent labor market indicators point to a slowing in job growth, particularly among smaller businesses. Hotel occupancy rates have flattened out. People aren’t going out to restaurants, bars, gas stations, pharmacies, and beauty salons as much. Consumer surveys, by the way, There are still some areas of strength. Housing and motor vehicle sales have still been strong. Nonetheless, on balance, it looks like the data are pointing to a slowing in the pace of the recovery. But I want to stress, it’s—it’s too early to say both how large that is and how sustained it will be. We just don’t know yet, because we have to wait for—to see the, you know, the actual data on spending and employment come in, and—but this—this is what we’re seeing, and, of course, we’re monitoring it very carefully. And I’d be remiss in not stressing this enough. The path of the economy is going to depend to a very high extent on the course of the virus and on the measures that we take to keep it in check. That is just a very fundamental fact about our economy right now. The two things are not in conflict. You know, social-distancing measures and fast reopening of the economy, they actually go together. They’re not in competition with each other. So—","Q&A","Press Conf","","469","2020-07"
"2020-07-29","Well, so our—our dollar swap lines—we introduced those back at the beginning of—of this episode after the pandemic made itself present. And dollar funding markets were in very difficult shape at the time. And the introduction of the swap lines has really to facilitate planning by other central banks and just so people will know that those facilities are still there. We want them to remain in place and be available as long as they are needed. And since, you know, the crisis and the economic fallout from—from the pandemic are far from over, we’re going to leave those in place for the time being. And we’ll leave them in place until we’re confident that they’re no longer needed. There’s nothing that’s going on in the market right now that raises any concerns. It’s just, we want them to be there as a backstop for markets.","Q&A","Press Conf","","146","2020-07"
"2020-07-29","Good afternoon. The pandemic continues to cause tremendous human and economic hardship here in the United States and around the world. The most important response to this public health crisis has come from our health-care workers, and we remain grateful to them and to the many other essential workers for putting themselves at risk day after day in service to others and to our country. All of us have a role to play in our nation’s response to the pandemic. At the Federal Reserve, we remain committed to using our tools to do what we can, and for as long as it takes, to provide some relief and stability, to ensure that the recovery will be as strong as possible, and to limit lasting damage to the economy. In recent months, economic activity picked up as the economy began to reopen. Many businesses opened their doors, factories restarted production, and more people left their homes to engage in various activities. As a result, household spending looks to have recovered about half of its earlier decline, although spending for services such as air travel and hotels has shown much less of a pickup. The recovery in household spending also likely owes to federal stimulus payments and expanded unemployment benefits, which provided substantial and timely support to household incomes. In contrast, indicators of business fixed investment have yet to show a recovery. Even with the improved economic news in May and June, overall activity remains well below its level before the pandemic, and the contraction in real GDP in the second quarter will likely be the largest on record. The labor market has followed a similar pattern. After precipitous drops in March and April, employment rose strongly in May and June as many people returned to work from temporary layoffs. As a result, of the roughly 22 million jobs that had been lost, about one-third had been regained as of the June payroll report. The unemployment rate declined in May and Americans, and those least able to bear the burden have been the most affected. In particular, the rise in joblessness has been especially severe for lower-wage workers, for women, and for African Americans and Hispanics. This reversal of economic fortune has upended many lives and created great uncertainty about the future. The pandemic has also left a significant imprint on inflation. For some goods, including food, supply constraints have led to notably higher prices, adding to the burden for those struggling with lost income. More broadly, however, weaker demand, especially in sectors— such as travel and hospitality—that have been most affected by the pandemic, has held down consumer prices, and, overall, inflation is running well below our symmetric 2 percent objective. Along with the recent increases in economic activity have come new challenges. After declining gradually from a peak near the end of April, the number of COVID-19 cases has increased sharply in many parts of the country since mid-June. We have thus entered a new phase in containing the virus, which is essential to protect both our health and our economy. As we have emphasized throughout the pandemic, the path forward for the economy is extraordinarily uncertain and will depend in large part on our success in keeping the virus in check. Indeed, we have seen some signs in recent weeks that the increase in virus cases and the renewed measures to control it are starting to weigh on economic activity. For example, some measures of consumer spending based on debit card and credit card use have moved down since late June, while recent labor market indicators point to a slowing in job growth, especially among smaller businesses. A full recovery is unlikely until people are confident that it’s safe to reengage in a broad range of activities. to this crisis has been guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people, along with our responsibilities to promote the stability of the financial system. We are committed to using our full range of tools to support the economy in this challenging time. We have held our policy rate near zero since mid-March and have stated that we will keep it there until we are confident that the economy has weathered recent events and is on track to achieve our maximum-employment and price-stability goals. We’ve been purchasing sizable quantities of Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities in order to support orderly conditions in the markets, which are vital to the flow of credit in the economy. To sustain smooth market functioning and foster effective transmission of monetary policy to broader financial conditions, we will continue to increase our holdings of Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities at least at the current pace. These purchases are also fostering more accommodative financial conditions. The Federal Reserve has also been taking broad and forceful actions to more directly support the flow of credit in the economy for households, for businesses large and small, and for state and local governments. Without access to credit, families could be forced to cut back on necessities or even lose their homes. Businesses could be forced to downsize or close, resulting in further job losses and income losses and worsening the downturn. Preserving the flow of credit is thus essential for mitigating the damage to the economy and promoting the recovery. Many of our programs rely on emergency lending powers that require the support of the Treasury Department and are available only in very unusual circumstances, such as those we find ourselves in today. These programs benefit the economy by providing financing where it is not deploying these lending powers to an unprecedented extent, enabled in large part by financial backing and support from Congress and the Treasury. We will continue to use these powers until we are confident that we are solidly on the road to recovery. This week we extended these programs through the end of the year. When the time comes, after the crisis has passed, we will put these emergency tools back in the toolbox. As I have emphasized before, these are lending powers, not spending powers. The Fed cannot grant money to particular beneficiaries. We can only create programs or facilities with broad-based eligibility to make loans to solvent entities with the expectation that the loans will be repaid. Many borrowers will benefit from these programs, as will the overall economy. But for many others, getting a loan that may be difficult to repay may not be the answer. In these cases, direct fiscal support may be needed. Elected officials have the power to tax and spend and to make decisions about where we, as a society, should direct our collective resources. The fiscal policy actions that have been taken thus far have made a critical difference to families, businesses, and communities across the country. Even so, the current economic downturn is the most severe in our lifetimes. It will take a while to get back to the levels of economic activity and employment that prevailed at the beginning of the year, and it will take continued support from both monetary and fiscal policy to achieve that. Before taking your questions, I’ll provide an update on our review of our monetary policy framework. [Clears throat] Excuse me. As a reminder, we began this public review of our monetary policy strategy, tools, and communication practices—a first for the Federal Reserve— early last year. Our purpose has been to take a comprehensive look at how we can best meet our situation, the lower level of interest rates has reduced the scope for the Committee to support the economy by cutting interest rates. Our plans to conclude this review were, like so many things, delayed by the pandemic. At this meeting, my colleagues and I resumed our discussions. Our focus was on possible enhancements to our Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy. This document states our goals, articulates our approach to monetary policy, and serves at the foundation—as the foundation for our policy actions. While I do not have any details to share with you today, I am confident that we will continue to make progress and will wrap up our deliberations in the near future. We understand that the work of the Fed touches communities, families, and businesses across the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission. We are committed to using our full range of tools to support the economy and to help assure that the recovery from this difficult period will be as robust as possible. Thank you. I will","Opening Statement","Press Conf","","1426","2020-07"

"2020-08-27","Having declined significantly in the five years following the crisis, the labor force participation rate flattened out and began rising even though the aging of the population suggested that it should keep falling.13For individuals in their prime working years, the participation rate fully retraced its post-crisis decline, defying earlier assessments that the Global Financial Crisis might cause permanent structural damage to the labor market.","General","Speech","N/A","64","2020-08"
"2020-08-27","Well-anchored inflation expectations are critical for giving the Fed the latitude to support employment when necessary without destabilizing inflation.18But if inflation expectations fall below our 2 percent objective, interest rates would decline in tandem.","General","Speech","N/A","34","2020-08"
"2020-08-27","In turn, we would have less scope to cut interest rates to boost employment during an economic downturn, further diminishing our capacity to stabilize the economy through cutting interest rates.","General","Speech","N/A","30","2020-08"
"2020-08-27","We have seen this adverse dynamic play out in other major economies around the world and have learned that once it sets in, it can be very difficult to overcome.","General","Speech","N/A","30","2020-08"
"2020-08-27","We want to do what we can to prevent such a dynamic from happening here.","General","Speech","N/A","15","2020-08"
"2020-08-27","Elements of the ReviewWe began our review with these changes in the economy in mind.","General","Speech","N/A","15","2020-08"
"2020-08-27","The review had three pillars: a series ofFed Listensevents held around the country, a flagship research conference, and a series of Committee discussions supported by rigorous staff analysis.","General","Speech","N/A","28","2020-08"
"2020-08-27","As is appropriate in our democratic society, we have sought extensive engagement with the public throughout the review.","General","Speech","N/A","18","2020-08"
"2020-08-27","TheFed Listensevents built on a long-standing practice around the Federal Reserve System of engaging with community groups.","General","Speech","N/A","17","2020-08"
"2020-08-27","The 15 events involved a wide range of participants—workforce development groups, union members, small business owners, residents of low- and moderate-income communities, retirees, and others—to hear about how our policies affect peoples' daily lives and livelihoods.19The stories we heard atFed Listensevents became a potent vehicle for us to connect with the people and communities that our policies are intended to benefit.","General","Speech","N/A","61","2020-08"
"2020-08-27","One of the clear messages we heard was that the strong labor market that prevailed before the pandemic was generating employment opportunities for many Americans who in the past had not found jobs readily available.","General","Speech","N/A","35","2020-08"
"2020-08-27","A clear takeaway from these events was the importance of achieving and sustaining a strong job market, particularly for people from low- and moderate-income communities.","General","Speech","N/A","25","2020-08"
"2020-08-27","The research conference brought together some of the world's leading academic experts to address topics central to our review, and the presentations and robust discussion we engaged in were an important input to our review process.20","General","Speech","N/A","36","2020-08"
"2020-08-27","Finally, the Committee explored the range of issues that were brought to light during the course of the review in five consecutive meetings beginning in July 2019.","General","Speech","N/A","27","2020-08"
"2020-08-27","Analytical staff work put together by teams across the Federal Reserve System provided essential background for each of the Committee's discussions.21","General","Speech","N/A","21","2020-08"
"2020-08-27","Our plans to conclude the review earlier this year were, like so many things, delayed by the arrival of the pandemic.","General","Speech","N/A","21","2020-08"
"2020-08-27","This dynamic is a problem because expected inflation feeds directly into the general level of interest rates.","General","Speech","N/A","17","2020-08"
"2020-08-27","Inflation that runs below its desired level can lead to an unwelcome fall in longer-term inflation expectations, which, in turn, can pull actual inflation even lower, resulting in an adverse cycle of ever-lower inflation and inflation expectations.","General","Speech","N/A","37","2020-08"
"2020-08-27","However, inflation that is persistently too low can pose serious risks to the economy.","General","Speech","N/A","14","2020-08"
"2020-08-27","And we are certainly mindful that higher prices for essential items, such as food, gasoline, and shelter, add to the burdens faced by many families, especially those struggling with lost jobs and incomes.","General","Speech","N/A","33","2020-08"
"2020-08-27","Third, and on a happier note, the record-long expansion that ended earlier this year led to the best labor market we had seen in some time.","General","Speech","N/A","26","2020-08"
"2020-08-27","The unemployment rate hovered near 50-year lows for roughly 2 years, well below most estimates of its sustainable level.","General","Speech","N/A","19","2020-08"
"2020-08-27","And the unemployment rate captures only part of the story.","General","Speech","N/A","10","2020-08"
"2020-08-27","Moreover, as the long expansion continued, the gains began to be shared more widely across society.","General","Speech","N/A","16","2020-08"
"2020-08-27","The Black and Hispanic unemployment rates reached record lows, and the differentials between these rates and the white unemployment rate narrowed to their lowest levels on record.14As we heard repeatedly in ourFed Listensevents, the robust job market was delivering life-changing gains for many individuals, families, and communities, particularly at the lower end of the income spectrum.15In addition, many who had been left behind for too long were finding jobs, benefiting their families and communities, and increasing the productive capacity of our economy.","General","Speech","N/A","82","2020-08"
"2020-08-27","Before the pandemic, there was every reason to expect that these gains would continue.","General","Speech","N/A","14","2020-08"
"2020-08-27","It is hard to overstate the benefits of sustaining a strong labor market, a key national goal that will require a range of policies in addition to supportive monetary policy.","General","Speech","N/A","30","2020-08"
"2020-08-27","When we resumed our discussions last month, we turned our attention to distilling the most important lessons of the review in a revised Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy.","General","Speech","N/A","31","2020-08"
"2020-08-27","Fourth, the historically strong labor market did not trigger a significant rise in inflation.","General","Speech","N/A","14","2020-08"
"2020-08-27","Inflation forecasts are typically predicated on estimates of the natural rate of unemployment, or ""u-star,"" and of how much upward pressure on inflation arises when the unemployment rate falls relative to u-star.16As the unemployment rate moved lower and inflation remained muted, estimates of u-star were revised down.","General","Speech","N/A","47","2020-08"
"2020-08-27","For example, the median estimate from FOMC participants declined from 5.5 percent in 2012 to 4.1 percent at present (seefigure 4).","General","Speech","N/A","21","2020-08"
"2020-08-27","The muted responsiveness of inflation to labor market tightness, which we refer to as the flattening of the Phillips curve, also contributed to low inflation outcomes.17In addition, longer-term inflation expectations, which we have long seen as an important driver of actual inflation, and global disinflationary pressures may have been holding down inflation more than was generally anticipated.","General","Speech","N/A","57","2020-08"
"2020-08-27","Other advanced economies have also struggled to achieve their inflation goals in recent decades.","General","Speech","N/A","14","2020-08"
"2020-08-27","The persistent undershoot of inflation from our 2 percent longer-run objective is a cause for concern.","General","Speech","N/A","16","2020-08"
"2020-08-27","Many find it counterintuitive that the Fed would want to push up inflation.","General","Speech","N/A","13","2020-08"
"2020-08-27","After all, low and stable inflation is essential for a well-functioning economy.","General","Speech","N/A","12","2020-08"
"2020-08-27","Over the years, forecasts from FOMC participants and private-sector analysts routinely showed a return to 2 percent inflation, but these forecasts were never realized on a sustained basis (seefigure 3).","General","Speech","N/A","30","2020-08"
"2020-08-27","New Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy StrategyThe federated structure of the Federal Reserve, reflected in the FOMC, ensures that we always have a diverse range of perspectives on monetary policy, and that is certainly the case today.","General","Speech","N/A","39","2020-08"
"2020-08-27","Nonetheless, I am pleased to say that the revised consensus statement was adopted today with the unanimous support of Committee participants.","General","Speech","N/A","21","2020-08"
"2020-08-27","Our new consensus statement, like its predecessor, explains how we interpret the mandate Congress has given us and describes the broad framework that we believe will best promote our maximum-employment and price-stability goals.","General","Speech","N/A","33","2020-08"
"2020-08-27","Therefore, following periods when inflation has been running below 2 percent, appropriate monetary policy will likely aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time.","General","Speech","N/A","27","2020-08"
"2020-08-27","In seeking to achieve inflation that averages 2 percent over time, we are not tying ourselves to a particular mathematical formula that defines the average.","General","Speech","N/A","25","2020-08"
"2020-08-27","Thus, our approach could be viewed as a flexible form of average inflation targeting.26Our decisions about appropriate monetary policy will continue to reflect a broad array of considerations and will not be dictated by any formula.","General","Speech","N/A","36","2020-08"
"2020-08-27","Of course, if excessive inflationary pressures were to build or inflation expectations were to ratchet above levels consistent with our goal, we would not hesitate to act.","General","Speech","N/A","27","2020-08"
"2020-08-27","The revisions to our statement add up to a robust updating of our monetary policy framework.","General","Speech","N/A","16","2020-08"
"2020-08-27","To an extent, these revisions reflect the way we have been conducting policy in recent years.","General","Speech","N/A","16","2020-08"
"2020-08-27","At the same time, however, there are some important new features.","General","Speech","N/A","11","2020-08"
"2020-08-27","To prevent this outcome and the adverse dynamics that could ensue, our new statement indicates that we will seek to achieve inflation that averages 2 percent over time.","General","Speech","N/A","28","2020-08"
"2020-08-27","Overall, our new Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy conveys our continued strong commitment to achieving our goals, given the difficult challenges presented by the proximity of interest rates to the effective lower bound.","General","Speech","N/A","36","2020-08"
"2020-08-27","And we will steadfastly seek to achieve a 2 percent inflation rate over time.","General","Speech","N/A","14","2020-08"
"2020-08-27","Looking AheadOur review has provided a platform for productive discussion and engagement with the public we serve.","General","Speech","N/A","17","2020-08"
"2020-08-27","TheFed Listensevents helped us connect with our core constituency, the American people, and hear directly how their everyday lives are affected by our policies.","General","Speech","N/A","24","2020-08"
"2020-08-27","We believe that conducting a review at regular intervals is a good institutional practice, providing valuable feedback and enhancing transparency and accountability.","General","Speech","N/A","22","2020-08"
"2020-08-27","And with the ever-changing economy, future reviews will allow us to take a step back, reflect on what we have learned, and adapt our practices as we strive to achieve our dual-mandate goals.","General","Speech","N/A","33","2020-08"
"2020-08-27","As our statement indicates, we plan to undertake a thorough public review of our monetary policy strategy, tools, and communication practices roughly every five years.","General","Speech","N/A","25","2020-08"

"2020-08-27","In conducting monetary policy, we will remain highly focused on fostering as strong a labor market as possible for the benefit of all Americans.","General","Speech","N/A","24","2020-08"
"2020-08-27","With interest rates generally running closer to their effective lower bound even in good times, the Fed has less scope to support the economy during an economic downturn by simply cutting the federal funds rate.12The result can be worse economic outcomes in terms of both employment and price stability, with the costs of such outcomes likely falling hardest on those least able to bear them.","General","Speech","N/A","65","2020-08"
"2020-08-27","Households and businesses will come to expect this result, meaning that inflation expectations would tend to move below our inflation goal and pull realized inflation down.","General","Speech","N/A","26","2020-08"
"2020-08-27","Our statement emphasizes that our actions to achieve both sides of our dual mandate will be most effective if longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2 percent.","General","Speech","N/A","28","2020-08"
"2020-08-27","Before addressing the key changes in our statement, let me highlight some areas of continuity.","General","Speech","N/A","15","2020-08"
"2020-08-27","We continue to believe that specifying a numerical goal for employment is unwise, because the maximum level of employment is not directly measurable and changes over time for reasons unrelated to monetary policy.","General","Speech","N/A","33","2020-08"
"2020-08-27","The significant shifts in estimates of the natural rate of unemployment over the past decade reinforce this point.","General","Speech","N/A","18","2020-08"
"2020-08-27","In addition, we have not changed our view that a longer-run inflation rate of 2 percent is most consistent with our mandate to promote both maximum employment and price stability.","General","Speech","N/A","30","2020-08"
"2020-08-27","Finally, we continue to believe that monetary policy must be forward looking, taking into account the expectations of households and businesses and the lags in monetary policy's effect on the economy.","General","Speech","N/A","31","2020-08"
"2020-08-27","Thus, our policy actions continue to depend on the economic outlook as well as the risks to the outlook, including potential risks to the financial system that could impede the attainment of our goals.","General","Speech","N/A","34","2020-08"
"2020-08-27","The key innovations in our new consensus statement reflect the changes in the economy I described.","General","Speech","N/A","16","2020-08"
"2020-08-27","However, if inflation runs below 2 percent following economic downturns but never moves above 2 percent even when the economy is strong, then, over time, inflation will average less than 2 percent.","General","Speech","N/A","32","2020-08"

"2020-09-16","Sure. So, first, if you look at the Summary of Economic Projections that my colleagues and I filed for this meeting, what you’ll see is an expectation that the recovery will continue—that it will continue at a reasonable pace through 2021, ’22, and ’23. We do expect that that pace will slow just because you would expect that the, the pace would be fastest right at the beginning of the—right at the beginning of the recovery, because you had such a sharp decline. You would expect that the third quarter should be the fastest gains, and that, after that, the pace should slow down to a more normal pace. So we do expect that. In terms of fiscal policy—you asked about fiscal policy. So, you know, one thing—I guess I would start by saying that the initial response from fiscal authorities was rapid. It was business equipment spending, and the fact that businesses are staying in business, and, you know, the pace of default and things like that has really slowed. So there’s been a really positive effect. That said, my sense is that more fiscal support is likely to be needed. Of course, the details of that are for Congress, not for the Fed. But I would just say, there are still roughly 11 million people still out of work due to the pandemic, and a good part of those people were working in industries that are likely to struggle. Those people may need additional, additional support as they try to find their way through what will be a difficult time for them. We’ve also got struggling small businesses, especially those in the business of facing directly to the public. And we have state and local governments dealing with a drop in revenue at the same time spending has gone up, much of it related to the pandemic and economic effects. So, again, I would say, the fiscal support has been essential in, in the good progress we see now. And, finally, I’ll note that just about all—the overwhelming majority of, of private forecasters who, who project an ongoing recovery are assuming there will be substantial additional fiscal support.","Q&A","Press Conf","","360","2020-09"
"2020-09-16","Accordingly, they agreed that the Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of policy as appropriate in the event that risks emerged that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals.","Participants' Views","Minutes","N/A","32","2020-09"
"2020-09-16","The System Open Market Account (SOMA) manager first discussed developments in financial markets.","Developments in Financial Markets","Minutes","N/A","13","2020-09"
"2020-09-16","So, you know, we think our—we think that our asset purchases are doing both the thing—both those things today. We think, clearly, there’s been great progress, in terms of market function. If you remember, early in the spring when the acute phase of the $120 billion a month—you know, which is much larger than, for example, the last asset purchase program during the Global Financial Crisis and the recovery therefrom—we think that that’s also providing accommodative financial conditions and supporting growth. And we think that’s fine. We’re also aware that we, we—there are ways we can adjust that, you know, to do various things—you know, make it smaller, make it larger, and also target different sectors of the—of the curve. And, you know, we’re, we’re going to continue to monitor developments, and we’re prepared to adjust our plans as appropriate.","Q&A","Press Conf","","140","2020-09"
"2020-09-16","Great. So, on the first one, what’s happening is basically we’re learning to live with—right now, we're learning to live with COVID, which still spreads. And we’re learning to, to engage in economic activity. All of this recovery that we’ve seen is in a context where—you know, where people are still at risk of, of catching it, and yet we’re able to resume lots and lots of economic activities. And that involves, as I mentioned, you know—I think the more social distancing we can preserve as we go back into the workforce—wearing masks, keeping our distance, that kind of thing—the better we’ll be able to get economic activity usage and is, is widely trusted. And those are the ones where people were getting really closely—close together. I also think testing—to the extent you have cheap and rapid testing, you can do a lot with that in the workforce. You can—you can build confidence in the workforce if you have regular—very regular testing that doesn’t cost very much and you get the results really quickly. If you do that, you’ll be able to open a lot of workforces, particularly in cities where the overall case numbers are quite low. And that will help a lot. So I think we’re, we’re going to be finding lots and lots of ways to get out towards—you know, as far as we can. There’s always going to be that—for, for some time, there’s going to be certain activities that will be—that will be hard to, to resume. So I, I think that’s the only way I can say it. And I think trying to—you know, we all—when we make a forecast, we make assessments about that, but it’s really hard to say. There is no template here. There’s no—you know, there’s no experience with this. So, frankly, for the last 60 days or so, the economy’s recovered faster than expected. And that may continue or not. We just don’t know. And I think we should do those things that we control to make sure that we can recover as quickly as possible. And the main thing, again, is wearing a mask and keeping your distance while you’re in the workforce. That’s something we can all do that will limit the spread and let people go back to work, avoid major outbreaks, and things like that. with you—nothing, really, that I can say that’s—on that today. I don’t have anything for you.","Q&A","Press Conf","","406","2020-09"
"2020-09-16","Sure. So, a couple things about Main Street. It, it reaches the whole nation. It’s got more than half of the banking industry assets signed up among the banks that are part of it, and it’s making loans. The number is more like—it’s close to $2 billion now. So the numbers are going up. Banks are joining; borrowers are coming. And it’s significant. It’s, it’s find that, that firms are not citing credit constraints as a top problem. And that, that is a lot of PPP, bank credit lines, and syndicated loans. There’s a lot of credit being let out there. So—but you’re right. We, we are looking at some things. We’re looking at—some lenders are concerned about the underwriting expectations. So banks are going to—their approach is likely to be that they’re going to underwrite this loan roughly the same as they underwrite any loan. They’re keeping part of it, and, you know, what, what we want to do is make sure that—that they know that they should take the payment deferrals and other things in, in place, and also that—you know, it’s, it’s really—it’s really a, a facility for, for companies or borrowers that, that don’t have access to, to “regular way” borrowing now. Otherwise, why would we need Main Street? So that’s what we're working on. And we’ll be doing some, some—we’ll be making some changes in that respect. I don’t—I saw what President Rosengren said. I, I can’t really comment directly on that. I just would say that, you know, this is 13(3). If you look at the law under section 13(3), it’s very clear that we are to make loans only to solvent borrowers. And, and the CARES Act is quite specific in keeping all of the terms of, of section 13(3) in effect, including the requirement that we, you know, gather good evidence that the borrower is solvent. This was—this law was amended in, you know, under—in Dodd-Frank, and the idea was, was to make it challenging and put hurdles in place before we made loans—at the time, the thinking was to banks. So now we—now we’re using that same law for, for smaller business borrowers, and, you know, it doesn’t—it’s not a perfect fit. And, and, I would also just say, for many borrowers, continuing to work to, to improve Main Street, to make it more broadly available—make it pretty much to any company that needs it and that can service a loan.","Q&A","Press Conf","","410","2020-09"
"2020-09-16","I can’t say. I don’t—I don’t know about that. I haven’t heard those reports. You know, again, if you think about it, we, we weren’t—we’re, we’re going to have to go through the banking system to do this. We—we’re not going to have a hundred thousand or a million loan officers working for the Fed and the Treasury. So we’re going to go through the banking system, and the banks—banks like to make good loans. That’s what they do. They’re trained to make good loans. So you should expect that they—and we expect that they will do some underwriting. We also want them to take some risk, obviously, because that was the point of it. And the question is, how do you dial that in? It’s, it’s not an easy thing to do. And, you know, we’re getting some loans made, and we’re hopeful that we’ll, that we’ll clarify this and that credit will continue to flow.","Q&A","Press Conf","","157","2020-09"
"2020-09-16","Yes, we—of course, we can’t be—we can’t be really sure we know the answers to those questions. But I would say, the, the likely path is that the—that the expansion will continue. And it’s, as I said, it’s well along, and it’ll move most easily through the parts of the economy—it’ll still take some time, but the parts of the economy that weren’t exactly directly affected, that didn’t involve getting people in large groups together to feed them, to fly them around, to put them in hotels, do entertainment, things like that—those are going to be the places that are—that are very challenging. So there will also be the—you know, the places that are affected that way. And that’s going to be challenging for, for some time. It just is. And we don’t really know how long that will be. It’s—you know, it’s millions of people. As I mentioned, we had 11 million—something like 11 million people in the payroll survey have gone back to work out of 22 million who went—who lost their jobs in March and April. So that’s half of them. So, 11 million— particularly if the pace of, of returning to work slows down, it’s going to leave a large—a large group of people. And it’ll be very meaningful from a macroeconomic standpoint. And our commitment is not to forget those people. As I mentioned, we want—you know, the sense of our forward guidance is that policy will remain, as we’ve said, highly accommodative until the— until the expansion is well along—really, very close to our goals. And even after, if we do lift off, we will keep policy accommodative until we actually have a moderate overshoot of inflation for some time. So those are powerful commitments that we think will, will support the full recovery, including those people, as long as it takes.","Q&A","Press Conf","","308","2020-09"
"2020-09-16","Well, no, I wouldn’t—I certainly would not say that we’re out of ammo. Not at all. So, first of all, we, we do have lots of tools. We’ve got the lending tools, we’ve got the balance sheet, and we’ve got further forward guidance—further forward guidance. So we, we—there’s still plenty more that we can do. We do think that our—that our, our rate policy stance is an appropriate one to support the economy. We think it’s powerful. And, as I mentioned, you know, this is the kind of guidance that will provide support for the economy over time, the idea being that policy will remain highly accommodative until the recovery is well along—really, very close to our goals—and then will remain accommodative even after we lift off. So I think that’s, that’s a really strong place for, for rate policy to be. But, again, we have the other margins that we can still use. So, no. Certainly, we’re not out of ammo.","Q&A","Press Conf","","162","2020-09"

"2020-09-16","So, in terms of the effects, so I think what we’ve done is—is more or less aligned with the consensus statement today. So it’s, it’s in line with what, what might have been expected. As I mentioned, I think over time it will provide very powerful support for this economy as we move forward. In a sense, it’s consistent with expectations, so I don’t—I’m not looking for a big reaction right now. But I think, over time, again, guidance that we expect to retain the current stance until the economy is—has moved very far toward our goals is a strong and powerful thing. And I think that will be supportive of the economy over time. In terms of additional fiscal support, I guess your question is, what would happen if— yes, so, people have different assessments, and, and different participants in the FOMC made different assessments on their own. I think broadly, though, there is an expectation among private forecasters and among FOMC participants that there will be some further fiscal action. And there does seem to be an appetite on the part of all the relevant players to doing something. The question is, how much and when? And so I would just say that if—and it’s very hard to say. So, so far the economy has proven resilient to the—to the lapsing of the—to the, of the CARES Act unemployment— enhanced unemployment benefits. But there’s, there’s certainly a risk, though, that, that those who are unemployed have saved—appear to have saved some of those benefits, and they’ll, they’ll now spend them, and that, as the months pass, if, if there’s no follow-up on that, if there isn’t additional support and there isn’t a job for the—some of those people who are, are from and, you know, things that will scar and damage the economy. So that’s a downside risk. So I, I think the real question is, is, when and how much and what will be the—what will be the contents? And, you know, no one—no one has any certainty around that, but, broadly speaking, if we don’t get that, then there would certainly be downside risks through the— certainly through the channel I mentioned.","Q&A","Press Conf","","366","2020-09"
"2020-09-16","So, as you know, maximum employment is not—is not something that can be reduced to a number the way inflation can. It’s a broad range of factors. It really always has been and, really, a substantial number of factors that we’ve indicated we would look at. So it’s broader labor conditions, consistent with our Committee’s assessment of maximum at a rule. We’re looking at a judgmental assessment, which I think we’ll be very transparent about as we—as we go forward. In terms of inflation, you know, this is a Committee that is both confident and committed to—and determined to reach our goals. And the idea that we would look for the, the quickest way out is just—it’s just not who we are. It’s not that—there’s no message of that here. We would not be looking for one month of 2 percent inflation; we said return to 2—to achieve 2 percent inflation. Okay. So just understand that, you know, we’re strongly committed to achieving our goals and the overshoot. So that should tell you about that. Oh, in terms of—okay, in terms of—so, what does “moderate” mean? It means not large. It doesn’t—it means not very high above 2 percent. It means moderate. I think that’s a fairly well-understood word. In terms of—in terms of “for a time,” what it means is not permanently and not for a sustained period. You know, we’re, we’re resisting the urge to try to create some sort of a rule or a formula here. And I think the, the public will understand pretty well what we want. It’s actually pretty straightforward. We want to achieve inflation that averages 2 percent over time. And if we do that, inflation expectations will be right at 2 percent, and that’ll help us achieve 2 percent inflation over time and avoid the situation where the central bank loses its ability to support the economy.","Q&A","Press Conf","","315","2020-09"
"2020-09-16","Because it—we think, looking at everything we know about inflation dynamics in the United States and around the world over recent decades, we expect it will take some time. We expect that the economy will recover quickly now, but that that pace will slow as, as people go back to work. And we’ll still have an area of the economy—a big area of the economy—that struggles. There will be slack in the economy. The economy will be below that inflation will come back, generally. And, I mean, that’s sort of what happened during the last long expansion. It’s a slow process, but—but there is a process there. Inflation does move up over time. We do expect that will continue today, and we expect that our, our guidance is powerful and will help that outcome. We think that—that effectively saying that policy will remain highly accommodative until the economy is very far along in its recovery should provide strong support for the economy and get us there sooner rather than later.","Q&A","Press Conf","","170","2020-09"

"2020-09-16","Good afternoon. At the Federal Reserve, we are strongly committed to achieving the monetary policy goals that Congress has given us—maximum employment and price stability. Since the beginning of the pandemic, we have taken forceful actions to provide some relief and stability, to ensure that the recovery will be as strong as possible, and to limit lasting damage to the economy. Today my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee and I made some important changes to our policy statement, including an update to our guidance for the likely path of our policy interest rate. Guided by our new Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy that we announced a few weeks ago, these changes clarify our strong commitment over a longer time horizon. Before describing today’s policy actions, let me briefly review recent economic developments. Economic activity has picked up from its depressed second-quarter level, when much of the economy was shut down to stem the spread of the virus. With the reopening of many businesses and factories and fewer people withdrawing from social interactions, household spending looks to have recovered about three-quarters of its earlier decline. Nonetheless, spending on services that typically require people to gather closely, including travel and hospitality, is still quite weak. The recovery in household spending also likely owes to federal stimulus payments and expanded unemployment benefits, which provided substantial and timely support to household incomes. Activity in the housing sector has returned to its level at the beginning of the year, and we are starting to see signs of an improvement in business investment. The recovery has progressed more quickly than generally expected, and forecasts from FOMC participants for economic growth this year have been revised up since our June Summary of In the labor market, roughly half of the 22 million jobs that were lost in March and April have been regained as many people returned to work. The unemployment rate declined over the past four months but remains elevated at 8.4 percent as of August. Although we welcome this progress, we will not lose sight of the millions of Americans who remain out of work. Looking ahead, FOMC participants project the unemployment rate to continue to decline; the median projection is 7.6 percent at the end of this year, 5.5 percent next year, and 4 percent by 2023. The economic downturn has not fallen equally on all Americans, and those least able to shoulder the burden have been hardest hit. In particular, the high level of joblessness has been especially severe for lower-wage workers in the services sector, for women, and for African Americans and Hispanics. The economic dislocation has upended many lives and created great uncertainty about the future. The pandemic has also left a significant imprint on inflation. For some goods, including food, supply constraints have led to notably higher prices, adding to the burden for those struggling with lost income. More broadly, however, weaker demand, especially in sectors that have been most affected by the pandemic, has held down consumer prices, and overall, inflation is running well below our 2 percent longer-run objective. The median inflation projection from FOMC participants rises from 1.2 percent this year to 1.7 percent next year and reaches 2 percent in 2023. As the economy began its recovery, COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths also rose. The reimposition of some social-distancing restrictions as well as more cautious behavior by many individuals have succeeded in slowing the spread of the virus. As we have emphasized our nation’s response to the pandemic. Following the advice of public health professionals to keep appropriate social distances and to wear masks in public will help get the economy back to full strength. A full economic recovery is unlikely until people are confident that it is safe to reengage in a broad range of activities. The path forward will also depend on the policy actions taken across all parts of the government to provide relief and to support the recovery for as long as needed. The Federal Reserve’s response to this crisis has been guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people, along with our responsibilities to promote the stability of the financial system. We remain committed to using our full range of tools to support the economy in this challenging time. The changes we made in today’s policy statement reflect our strategy to achieve our dual- mandate goals by seeking to eliminate shortfalls from maximum employment and achieve inflation that averages 2 percent over time, as we articulated in our Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy. We view maximum employment as a broad-based and inclusive goal and do not see a high level of employment as posing a policy concern unless accompanied by signs of unwanted increases in inflation or the emergence of other risks that could impede the attainment of our goals. And we believe that achieving inflation that averages 2 percent over time helps ensure that longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored at our longer-run 2 percent objective. In turn, well-anchored inflation expectations enhance our ability to meet both our employment and inflation objectives, particularly in the new normal in which interest rates are closer to their effective lower bound even in good times. averages 2 percent over time and longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2 percent.” We expect “to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until these outcomes”—including maximum employment—“are achieved.” With regard to interest rates, we now indicate that we expect it will be appropriate to maintain the current 0 to ¼ percent target range for the federal funds rate “until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee’s assessments of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time.” In addition, over coming months we will continue to increase our “holdings of Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities at least at the current pace.” These asset purchases are intended “to sustain smooth market functioning and help foster accommodative financial conditions, thereby supporting the flow of credit to households and businesses.” We believe the strong policy guidance we are providing today will serve the economy well by promoting our goals through the many possible paths the recovery may take. Of course, as we note in our policy statement, we “would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of our [the Committee’s] goals.” The Federal Reserve has also been taking broad and forceful actions to more directly support the flow of credit in the economy for households, for businesses large and small, and for state and local governments. Preserving the flow of credit is essential for mitigating the damage to the economy and promoting a robust recovery. Many of our programs rely on emergency lending powers that require the support of the Treasury Department and are available only in through normal channels. We have deployed these lending powers to an unprecedented extent, enabled, in large part, by financial backing and support from Congress and the Treasury. When the time comes, after the crisis has passed, we will put these emergency tools back in the toolbox. As I have emphasized before, these are lending powers, not spending powers. The Fed cannot grant money to particular beneficiaries. We can only create programs or facilities with broad-based eligibility to make loans to solvent entities with the expectation that the loans will be repaid. Many borrowers are benefiting from these programs, as is the overall economy. But for many others, getting a loan that may be difficult to repay may not be the answer. In these cases, direct fiscal support may be needed. Elected officials have the power to tax and spend and to make decisions about where we, as a society, should direct our collective resources. The fiscal policy actions that have been taken thus far have made a critical difference to families, businesses, and communities across the country. Even so, the current economic downturn is the most severe in our lifetimes. It will take a while to get back to the levels of economic activity and employment that prevailed at the beginning of this year, and it may take continued support from both monetary and fiscal policy to achieve that. We understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission. We are committed to using our full range of tools to support the economy and to help assure that the recovery from this difficult period will be as robust as possible. FOMC and have played a key role in the policy decisions that will define this era of the Federal Reserve. He will be remembered for his intellect, but also his kindness, his equanimity, and his dedication to achieving our mission on behalf of the American people. We will miss him. Thank you. I’ll now be glad to take your questions.","Opening Statement","Press Conf","","1505","2020-09"
"2020-09-16","You know, so, of course we monitor financial conditions very carefully. These are—these are not new questions. These were questions that were very much in the air a decade ago and more when, when the Fed first started doing QE. And, I would say, if you look at the long experience of, you know, the 10-year, 8-month expansion, the longest in our housing bubble or some kind of a bubble, the popping of which could threaten the expansion. That didn’t happen. And, frankly, it hasn’t really happened around the world since then. That doesn’t mean that it won’t happen, but—and so, of course, it’s something that we monitor carefully. After the financial crisis, we started a new—a whole division of the Fed to focus on financial stability. We look at it in every—from every perspective. The FOMC gets briefed on a quarterly basis. At the Board here, we talk about it more or less on an ongoing basis, so it is something we monitor. But I don’t know that the—that the connection between asset purchases and, and financial stability is a particularly tight one. So—but again, we won’t be—we won’t be just assuming that. We’ll be checking carefully as we go. And, by the way, the kinds of tools that we would use to address those sorts of things are not really monetary policy. It would be more tools that strengthen the financial system.","Q&A","Press Conf","","234","2020-09"
"2020-09-16","So, I mean, I think the overall picture—take a step back from this. The overall picture is clear, and that is that the labor market has been recovering, but that it’s a long way—a long way from maximum employment. I think that’s, that’s the bottom line on it. claims—that’s a new system that had to be set up. The actual counting of the claims is, is volatile, and, and it’s very difficult to take much signal about the particular level. So, you know, because people were setting those systems up, and when they got them set up, they counted them all at once and things like that. I think, though, what you’ve seen is that the level of—certainly the level of initial claims has declined very sharply from the very high levels of March and April and is now at a lower level—continues either to be flat or gradually decline. It’s worth noting—and that’s good—it’s worth noting that that level is maybe five times the level of what claims were. Claims were around 200,000; now they’re 900,000, in that range, weekly for, for initial claims. So that just tells you, the labor market has improved, but it’s a long, long way from maximum employment, and it will be some time getting back there. I think that’s the best way to think about it. In many parts of the economy there’s just a lot of disruption, and it’s, it’s really hard to say precisely where we are. I’ll give you another example with—you know, we say unemployment’s 8.4 percent. But if you count those who are—who are misidentified as, as employed when they’re actually unemployed and you add back some part of the participation number—so if you were—if you had a job and you were in the labor force in February and you lost it because of the pandemic, some of you are now being reported as out of the labor force. But I—you know, I would—I would more look at those people as unemployed. If you add those back, the level of unemployment’s probably 3 percent higher. On the other hand, by that metric, the, the","Q&A","Press Conf","","356","2020-09"
"2020-09-16","Yes, absolutely. You know, I, I can’t be precise about a particular number, but let me just say, there was a lot to like about 3½ percent unemployment. It’s not a magic number. No one would say that number is the touchstone or that is, you know, maximum employment. I would just say, you asked about 3½ percent. A 3½ percent unemployment rate showed, you know, gains being shared very widely across the income spectrum—in fact, going more to people at the bottom end of the spectrum. It showed labor force participation coming up as—up above many estimates of its trend, as people who’d been out of the labor force were being pulled into a tight job market. There’s a lot to like about a tough—a tight job market, particularly in a world where we didn’t see inflation. So, yes, we’d love to get back to that. I mean, I would say, we would like to get back—rather than to a particular number, we’d like to get back to a strong labor market where wages are moving up, where people can find work, where labor force participation is holding up nicely. That’s what we’d really love to get back to. Now, of course we would—we need inflation to perform in line with, with our framework. But the good news is, we think we can have quite low unemployment without raising troubling inflation.","Q&A","Press Conf","","232","2020-09"
"2020-09-16","You know, we do—we are gifted with a, a substantial group of researchers who really cover the waterfront. And we do a significant amount of research on racial disparities in—across multiple variables, including wealth, as you asked about. So we do that. And we also—remember, we have our Division of Consumer and Community Affairs, which is present in communities around the country. And the Reserve Banks all have very active community affairs groups. They’re present in communities around the country. So it wasn’t just the Fed—Fed Listens events. It’s more, just, over a long period of time we, we are in contact with people in those communities to understand their experience of the economy. We serve all Americans, and we know that. And we’re going to use our tools to, to reflect that fact. So the answer is “yes.” We do quite a bit of research, and I suppose we could do more, but we really do a lot. And we contribute to those fields and those assessments of, of the state of the economy. And we do that not just because it’s interesting and important, but because it’s important for the economy and important for our mandate. We are assigned “maximum employment.” Now, what does that mean? As I mentioned earlier, it doesn’t mean a particular headline unemployment number. What it means is maximum employment. So, you know, we look at—look at that in many, many different variables, and we ask ourselves whether those variables are—those labor market conditions are consistent with our assessments of what would constitute maximum employment. And that would include all of the things that we’re talking about.","Q&A","Press Conf","","273","2020-09"
"2020-09-16","I wouldn’t—I don’t want to comment particularly on, on the two dissenters, but they, they consent—they dissented from, of course, different perspectives, and, and that should be clear. That’s their—they’re not they’re sort of on, on two sides of the, of the discussion. But I would say this: I am blessed —with having a Committee of highly thoughtful people who bring diverse life experiences and diverse careers, and, of course, diverse views to our work. And I wouldn’t have it any other way. I wouldn’t. So, so I would just say, the right—in our discussions the last couple of days, the whole Committee, everybody on the Committee is very supportive of the Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy and what’s in there—very, very broad support, unanimous support for that. Everyone sees the, the changes in the underlying economy and sees, in their own way, the need to address those—and including the changes we made to the employment mandate and to inflation so that we’re now at flexible average inflation targeting. Of course, there would be—this is—you know, we’re the first major central bank to adopt this framework. There’s no cookbook, and we—you know, this is the first guidance under our new framework. So, of course there would be a wide range of views, and you would expect that. And it’s actually a healthy thing. So I welcome that discussion. I would also say this: You think today is a very good first step in doing that. It is strong, powerful guidance. It is—it ties in very nicely with the Statement of [on] Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy. We had quite a robust discussion, and there are, there are different ideas on how to do this, but I—that’s just, that’s just the way it is when you have a diverse group of highly thoughtful and effective people. And so I’m pleased with where it came out.","Q&A","Press Conf","","318","2020-09"
"2020-09-16","So thank you for that question. You know, we’ve actually spent quite a bit of time on this as Secretary Mnuchin, I think, mentioned the other day. And I’ll say just a couple things. First, you know, our facilities are essentially always—they have to be, under the law—broad based and not so much targeting any single sector. Also, it’s important to remember that CRE, commercial real estate, benefits from several of our existing facilities. So the TALF takes commercial mortgage-backed securities and SBA commercial real estate deals. And the New York Fed purchases agency CMBSs directly. In addition, I would say, Main Street helps businesses pay their rent, you know. So we’re, we’re helping real estate, you know, in a number of other ways—commercial real estate. covenants—uniformly, I think, have covenants that forbid them to take on more debt. So you have a situation, and you have a situation where, where you—without a legal change or some kind of an innovation that defies discovery so far, you’re—you have a hard time providing mass relief with regard to real estate that’s in, in commercial mortgage-backed securities. So we’re still working on it. We’re still looking. I would say, it may be that further support for commercial real estate will require further action for Congress—from Congress.","Q&A","Press Conf","","214","2020-09"
"2020-09-16","That’s a very, very important question, and I actually spoke about that in my Jackson Hole remarks a couple weeks ago. It’s not intuitive to people. It is intuitive that, that high inflation is a bad thing. It’s less intuitive that inflation can be too low. And the way I would explain it is, is that inflation that’s too low will mean that interest rates are lower. There’s an expectation of future inflation that’s built into every interest rate, right? And to the extent inflation gets lower and lower and lower, interest rates get lower and lower. And then the Fed will have less room to cut rates to support the economy. And this isn’t some idle, you know, academic theory. This is what’s happening all over the world. If you, if you look at many, many large jurisdictions around the world, you are seeing that phenomenon. built into interest rates. And that’s just—that’s all we want. So we’re not looking to have high inflation. We just want inflation to average 2 percent. And that means that, you know, in a downturn, these days, what happens is, inflation, as has happened now—it moves down well below 2 percent. And that means that we’ve said for, for—we would like to see and we will conduct policies so that inflation moves, for some time, moderately above 2 percent. So it won’t be—these won’t be large overshoots, and they won’t be permanent but to help anchor inflation expectations at 2 percent. So, yes, it’s, it’s a challenging concept for a lot of people. But, nonetheless, the economic importance of it is, is large. And, you know, those are the people we’re serving, and, you know, we serve them best if we can actually achieve average 2 percent inflation, we believe. And that’s why we changed our framework.","Q&A","Press Conf","","304","2020-09"

And today we said that we’d “be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of our [the Committee’s] goals.” But you asked specifically about, about financial stability. One thing I would say is that financial—that monetary policy should not be the first line of defense—is not the first line of defense on financial stability. We look to more appropriate tools in the first instance as a first line of defense, and those would be regulation, supervision, high capital, high liquidity, stress testing—all of those things, macroprudential tools. All of those things are, are really the first line of defense on financial stability.

"2020-11-05","So when I say we’re not out of ammo, I’m looking at, you know, a couple of our tools, mainly. As I mentioned, the asset purchase program—there’s a number of dimensions in which we can adjust that if we deem it to be appropriate. Right now, we like the job it’s doing. We could, you know, if, if the facilities are extended, we could certainly look at knows? But, certainly, the facilities have been doing a lot of work and been very successful, I think, overall in accomplishing that job. So I do think there, there are things that we can do. But, remember, we’ve always said this will take a whole of government approach, including health-care policy and fiscal policy too. So it really is, if you—if you want to get the economy back as quickly as possible to where we want it to be, then, then really it should be all of government working together.","Q&A","Press Conf","","157","2020-11"
"2020-11-05","So I don’t really have a specific hypothetical I would—I would put to you. I would just say that we, we understand that there are a number of parameters that we have where we can shift the composition, the duration, you know, the size, the life, life cycle of the program. All of those things are, are available to us as ways to deliver addition—you know, more accommodation if we think that’s appropriate. Right now, we, we like the amount of accommodation the program is, is delivering. And it will just depend on the—on the facts and circumstances. We may reach a view at some point that we need to do more on that front. Today’s meeting was about analyzing the—one of the things it was about was about analyzing the various ways and having a, you know, good discussion about how to think about those, those various parameters, which I, I thought was quite a useful discussion.","Q&A","Press Conf","","158","2020-11"
"2020-11-05","Yes. There’s a bunch of programs. I would say that the, you know, the corporate—the larger corporate market-based lending program has been very successful without making a single loan—I think, unambiguously, has been a big success. I think the success—I think the state and local government program has also restored market function so that—whereas, you know, there were the, the sort of individual investors who wind up funding loans in the muni market through. through mutual funds, they, they had withdrawn a lot of money, and, and that—we’ve had many weeks of consecutive, I believe, of, of inflows there, and you’re largely back to a normal functioning market. I think that’s also been a success. I think the other—certainly the, the funding market programs have been a big success. challenging. I do think, you know, the grant programs, the PPP, were, were a great way to reach smaller companies. You know, what you hear out there is that demand—you talk to banks, and they’ll say demand for loans is very, very low right now. Companies are not borrowing. And, and the reason is that, you know, activity’s at a relatively low level. They don’t want to run up their debt. You know, so I—we put, we put an awful lot into Main Street, and it is very challenging to reach a lot of those companies. But I—you know, I think we, we are reaching many of them now, and, and I hope that the new changes will help us reach more.","Q&A","Press Conf","","251","2020-11"
"2020-11-05","Sure. So, we have had very little demand below $1 million in loans. And part of that just is that the fee structure is what it is, and that’s the compensation that the banks get. And there’s a certain amount of work that they have to do to get—to get into the loan program and do—and to document the thing, the loans that they make because these are loans that, you know, go on their balance sheet. They keep 5 percent, so they actually have to underwrite the credit. And we’re relying on them, to some extent, for, for doing that. And so we were reluctant. We moved the minimum down to $250,000, and we were reluctant to go below that. But we heard, over and over again, that it would be great if we could reduce it to $100,000. So—and, you know, we’ve been saying we’d have to redesign the program. And I, I got the question in a—in an oversight hearing a month or so ago with the Secretary and said that. program so that we could move to a lower level? And it—basically, we concluded we could just change the fee structure to create incentives for that, so we did that. We try to be responsive. We want, you know, qualifying businesses to be able to borrow. And we’ll see how much demand will come. You know, with, with these programs, why did it—why didn’t we do it right away? We tend to—it’s—there’s more work than one might—certainly than I imagined in setting up one of these facilities. And you, you just try to get it out there and get it working and not try to do everything before you start it because you’ll never start it if you do that. Then you get it started, and you make changes. And we’ve been willing to make changes. That’s the most recent set of ones that we’ve done. And, again, we hope—we hope that it will help some companies, and I guess we’ll find out.","Q&A","Press Conf","","337","2020-11"
"2020-11-05","Thanks. So I’m very reluctant, as you will imagine, to comment on the election directly, indirectly, at all, other than just to say that it’s a good time to take a step back and let the institutions of our democracy do their jobs. So, at the Fed here, we will, as discussions. I would say, you know, the meeting we just finished, for example, what we do is we talk about the economy and markets, domestically and around the world. We hear reports on how households and businesses are doing. We talk about risks to the outlook. We talk about what the right policy response might be. And the election comes up in some—you know, it comes up now and again, but it is not at all a central focus of the meeting. Not at all. So I, I’ll just leave it at that. Again, very reluctant to get into anything more than that. Thanks.","Q&A","Press Conf","","155","2020-11"
"2020-11-05","So let me say why it’s such an important—you know, in a world where so many payments are made digitally and all that, coins and currency are very important for the relatively low-income people. And so it’s a really incredibly important part of the payment system, and we do pay a lot of attention to it. And I actually just—I just caught up this morning with the—with the person who heads that operation here who, who says that, yes, things have really gotten significantly better on the coin front. So we worked very hard to increase the supply of coins and, even more than that, the distribution of coins around the System and are happy to say that that situation is well on the way to normalizing itself. So very pleased to report that.","Q&A","Press Conf","","134","2020-11"
"2020-11-05","So, on your first question, we, we really are just turning to this issue now, and we have not made any decisions. We, we are just getting started on it, and, and it’s a decision that we’ll make jointly with the Treasury Department. And that’s, that’s really all I can say today. That’s all I have for you on that today. In terms of the tail risks, I mean, I think clearly the tail risks that we were worried about have, have subsided. And, you know, we were worried about very negative potential outcomes. And that—you know, that’s, that’s—what is to be expected of us is, is to think about how things can go wrong as well as the way things that can go right. But we, we have to—we do make policy from a risk-management standpoint. We don’t just look at the most likely case. We, we ask, “How do you make policy in light of the risks?” and often it’s downside risks in a situation like this. I would not say that anybody’s feeling comfortable about this, though. You know, we’ve gotten through the first five, six months of the—of the expansion better than expected, but we do see in Europe—look what’s happening in Europe, look what’s happening here—another spike in cases as the cold weather arrives and people are inside more. So I think we have to be humble about where we are relative to this—to this disease. It hasn’t gone away. Clearly, you know, therapeutics are advancing, research on vaccines are advancing, death rates are way down, hospitalization rates are, are lower now, but—so we’re learning. But, I mean, we, we are so— we’re very far from saying that we think we’ve got this and eliminated the tail risks. But I think, clearly, the tail risks have, have diminished since—at least our perception of them has diminished since earlier in the year.","Q&A","Press Conf","","316","2020-11"
"2020-11-05","So let me—let me say, in the first instance, our, our main focus is on doing our job, and that is really what we’re, we’re focused on is using the tools that Congress has given us and the assignment they’ve given us. And I think we’re, we’re—that is the thing that we think about night and day. I just know from, from the experience of the last cycle, it helps to have the whole government working on these things, and this one is particularly that way. And I, I don’t—I think—you know, I, I don’t want to say whether I feel like I’m being heard or not. But, sure, I think there are plenty of people on Capitol Hill who, on both sides of the aisle, on both sides of the Hill, who see a need for further fiscal action and understand perfectly why that might be the case.","Q&A","Press Conf","","149","2020-11"
"2020-11-05","So, on the first—the first question, it’s—our asset purchases are serving both purchases, both—sorry, both purposes: financial market function and support for economic activity. So—and that’s really been true—I think in the very beginning of the crisis, purchases are also supporting economic activity, and that’s important. And that need hasn’t dwindled at all. So, so we haven’t looked at reducing purchases. So in terms of what they can do, first I would just say, the purchases that we have in place are providing strong support to economic activity still. And, by the way, they’re sustaining the gains we’ve made in financial stability. You know, we don’t—we don’t take anything for granted. We, we don’t expect that things will deteriorate. But, nonetheless, we have a habit of keeping things in place for a while. So we’re not taking our gains in financial market function for granted, although, admittedly, they’ve been very large. So the asset purchases are just another very important piece of the accommodative policy stance that we have. And, you know, as you know, these—we’re buying $120 billion a month. That’s $1.44 trillion, if I remember my times tables. And it’s just providing a lot of support for, for economic activity and, by the way, removing just about the same amount of duration risk from private hands as QE3 did. So this is a big program, and it’s doing a lot of good. And we also, today, you know, we had a full discussion of the options around quantitative ease—not quantitative easing, the asset purchase program, and, you know, we understand the, the ways in which we can adjust the parameters of it to deliver more accommodation if it turns out to be appropriate. Right now, we think that this very large, effective program is delivering about the right amount of accommodation and support for the markets, and so it continues.","Q&A","Press Conf","","312","2020-11"
"2020-11-05","Yes, thanks. So, first, let me say, we do think that the facilities have, have generally served their purposes well, particularly in supporting the flow of credit, particularly acting as backstops to private markets. So, overall, we think that the, the programs have, have gone well. In terms of the extension, we are, we are just now turning to that question. You know, we’ve had a lot of things to work our way through. Right now we’re just in the process of turning to that question and, of course, not made any decisions. And in terms of the process, this is a decision that, of course, we have to make and will make jointly with the Treasury Department.","Q&A","Press Conf","","118","2020-11"
"2020-11-05","Thank you. So you did—you laid out nicely the, the risks of damage to the supply side of the economy, or “scarring,” as you put it. And we’ve been talking about those since the very beginning of the pandemic. The risk is that, for example, people are out of the labor force for an extended period of time. They lose their attachment to the labor force, and it’s harder to get back. Your skills atrophy. It’s harder to get back in. And the record is, if you don’t get back in very fairly quickly, it can be harder to get back in. And that holds down the whole economy. And, by the way, it also—it places enormous burdens on individuals who may have this happen to them at an important stage in their career. So it’s, it’s, it’s important. And, you know—so that is one of the reasons why our response was so strong and so urgent at the beginning and why we called this, this set of risks out. I don’t know how we could be much more vocal about it than we have been. Fortunately, for—you know, the economic recovery has exceeded, certainly, the downside cases that we were very concerned about and even, even exceeded—sort of exceeded the baseline expectations. Now, that’s so far. We are a long way from our goals. And, you know, we’re, we’re sort of halfway there on the labor market recovery at best. And, and there are parts of the economy where it’s going to be hard until there’s a vaccine—you know, the parts of the economy. So, you know, that’s the supply-side damage. That’s sort of the third thing that we talk about. The first, at the beginning, it was to provide relief and comfort. The second—then the second part was to I think we have been vocal. You know, we’ll, we’ll try to continue to do that. And, and those are—that’s again—that goes to keeping this episode as short as it can be and avoiding unnecessary business bankruptcies, unnecessary household bankruptcies, and unnecessary long- term stays of unemployment or supporting people through them so that they can maintain their financial footing and their lives and be able to go back to work in a productive way. It’s, it’s very important that—you know, there is a real threat here of those things, and, and, you know, we’re trying to do everything we can to minimize that threat.","Q&A","Press Conf","","406","2020-11"
"2020-11-05","So on your first question, you know, we’ll take into account all external factors and, and do what we think we need to do with the tools that we have to pursue our goals. That’s what we will do. And I’ve said it on a couple of occasions that that will go better and move more quickly if we have a broad set of policies from across the government. And we’ve said this in the very beginning: It’s really, first and foremost, health-care policy, getting the—getting the spread of the virus under control and working on therapeutics and vaccines and that kind of thing, getting—so that—those are absolutely critical to the economy. Now, those are important, as well as health policies. They’re, they’re going to be critical to the obviously support financial stability through our lending programs, and, and we can support demand through, through interest rates and asset purchases and that sort of thing. So we’re, we’re going to take the economy as it comes, including all external factors. So I think all of us lived through the experience of the—of the years after the Global Financial Crisis. And for a number of years there, in the middle of the recovery, fiscal policy was pretty tight. And. and I think I just would say that I think we’ll have a stronger recovery if we can just get at least some more fiscal support when it’s appropriate, you know, when it’s appropriate and in the size Congress thinks is appropriate. I do think that that will likely—and, by the way, you see, you know, a lot of discussion on both sides of the aisle, on both sides of the Hill that suggests generally that there will be something.","Q&A","Press Conf","","288","2020-11"
"2020-11-05","Sure. So, of course. Let’s start with February. In February, we had an economy that was performing well. Then the pandemic hit, and we had a record decline in has now moderated, so it’s not unexpected. And I think if you look at just about anything, you know, for example, the payroll readings, the payroll job gains in May and June were just outsized. And they’re certainly still very large, but they’ve—but the pace of improvement has moderated. That’s the case for, for all different measures in the labor force—in the labor market, rather. Another would be claims. Just about all the data were—showed a big bounceback. But then, as you would expect, when, when you sort of had people—a lot of people go back to work at once, the pace will moderate. Same thing with economic activity. Most forecasts call for, you know, still a significant growth in the fourth quarter but not at the 33 percent annualized pace that we had in the third quarter. So, in a sense, that would be—that would be as expected. We have been concerned that the downside risks, though, are, are prevalent now, which are—which are really the risk of the further spread of the disease and also the risk that, that households will run through the savings they’ve managed to accumulate on their balance sheet and that that could weigh on activity. But what we see up to the present, really, is, continued growth, continued expansion, but at, at a gradually moderating pace.","Q&A","Press Conf","","252","2020-11"
"2020-11-05","Good afternoon. At the Federal Reserve, we are strongly committed to achieving the monetary policy goals that Congress has given us—maximum employment and price stability. Since the beginning of the pandemic, we have taken forceful actions to provide relief and stability, to ensure that the recovery will be as strong as possible, and to limit lasting damage to the economy. Today my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee and I reaffirmed our commitment to support the economy in this challenging time. Economic activity has continued to recover from its depressed second-quarter level. The reopening of the economy led to a rapid rebound in activity, and real GDP rose at an annual rate of 33 percent in the third quarter. In recent months, however, the pace of improvement has moderated. Household spending on goods, especially durable goods, has been strong and has moved above its pre-pandemic level. In contrast, spending on services remains low, largely due to ongoing weakness in sectors that typically require people to gather closely, including travel and hospitality. The overall rebound in household spending owes, in part, to federal stimulus payments and expanded unemployment benefits, which provided essential support to many families and individuals. The housing sector has fully recovered from the downturn, supported in part by low mortgage interest rates. Business investment has also picked up. Even so, overall economic activity remains well below its level before the pandemic, and the path ahead remains highly uncertain. In the labor market, roughly half of the 22 million jobs that were lost in March and April have been regained, as many people were able to return to work. As with overall economic activity, the pace of improvement in the labor market has moderated. The unemployment rate declined over the past five months but remained elevated at 7.9 percent as of September. least able to shoulder the burden have been hardest hit. In particular, the high level of joblessness has been especially severe for lower-wage workers in the services sector, for women, and for African Americans and Hispanics. The economic dislocation has upended many lives and created great uncertainty about the future. The pandemic has also left a significant imprint on inflation. Following large declines in the spring, consumer prices picked up over the summer, in part reflecting a rise in durable goods prices. However, for those sectors that have been most affected by the pandemic, prices remain particularly soft. Overall, on a 12-month basis, inflation remains below our 2 percent longer-run objective. As we have emphasized throughout the pandemic, the outlook for the economy is extraordinarily uncertain and will depend in large part on the success of efforts to keep the virus in check. The recent rise in new COVID-19 cases, both here in the United States and abroad, is particularly concerning. All of us have a role to play in our nation’s response to the pandemic. Following the advice of public health professionals to keep appropriate social distances and to wear masks in public will help get the economy back to full strength. A full economic recovery is unlikely until people are confident that it’s safe to reengage in a broad range of activities. The Federal Reserve’s response to this crisis has been guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people, along with our responsibilities to promote the stability of the financial system. As noted in our Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, we view maximum employment as a “broad-based and inclusive goal.” Our ability to achieve maximum employment in the years ahead depends importantly on inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time so that inflation averages 2 percent over time and longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2 percent. We expect to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until these employment and inflation outcomes are achieved. With regard to interest rates, we continue to expect that it will be appropriate to maintain the current 0 to ¼ percent target range for the federal funds rate until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee’s assessments of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time. In addition, over coming months we will continue to increase our holdings of Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities at least at the current pace. These asset purchases are intended to sustain smooth market functioning and help foster accommodative financial conditions, thereby supporting the flow of credit to households and businesses. At this meeting, my colleagues and I discussed our asset purchases and the role they are playing in supporting the recovery. At the current pace, our holdings of securities are rising at a substantial rate of $120 billion per month—$80 billion per month of Treasuries and $40 billion per month of agency","Opening Statement","Press Conf","","809","2020-11"
"2020-11-05","You know, so I’m going to take your question literally. And so if the idea is money-financed fiscal policy, that’s not something that we would consider. So that— what I mean by that is, is really, you know, the, the central bank is really funding fiscal activities of the government fairly directly. No, that’s not something we do. We have different jobs. That separation between those jobs is absolutely critical in our system of government. The—you We have a specific, you know, job to do with, with a specific set of tools to support maximum employment, stable prices, financial stability, help the payment system, supervise banks—all the things we’re assigned to do. But we, we, we’re not going to get into financing the government and, and—by the way, when we buy government bonds, we don’t—it doesn’t actually, as you probably know, doesn’t change the amount of government debt outstanding. We issue a reserve to, to purchase a Treasury security, and that’s just another form—on the consolidated balance sheet of the federal government, that’s just another obligation. You change the—you change the, you know, the nature of the obligation, but not the total quantity of debt that the government has when you do these asset purchase programs. So I don’t know exactly what you’re referring to. But, you know, to—again, to take your question literally about financing fiscal activity, it’s really not something that we think the central bank should do and, and not something we’re looking at.","Q&A","Press Conf","","247","2020-11"

"2020-11-05","Okay, thanks. So two questions. First, I, I take the sense of your first question to be, is monetary policy out of power or out of ammo? And the answer to that would be “no,” I don’t think that. I think—I think that we are strongly committed to using these powerful tools that we have to support the economy during this difficult time for as long as needed, and no one should have any doubt about that. And we do not doubt the power of the things that we’ve already done or the things that we may, may do in the future. I do think there’s more that can be done. And I also think, if you look at the stock of assets that we’ve bought, if you look at the facilities and, and the way we’ve been able to keep accommodative financial— financial conditions accommodative, I think we’ve been able to do a lot of things that are I’ve said—we’ve said from the very beginning, though, that this is particular—that the particular situation we find ourselves in is one where there is a sudden loss of income on, on the part of millions and tens of millions of people. It’s not so much a typical recession where demand weakens, the Fed cuts interest rates, interest rates stimulate demand, and the economy recovers. It’s a sudden shock where tens of millions of people are out of work. And the fiscal response was, was frankly, I think, very good and very robust in the United States. And it’s certainly one of the main reasons why the recovery has been as good as it’s been so far. So I do think fiscal policy is absolutely essential here. You know, stimulating aggregate demand is one thing, but where there’s a part of the economy that kind of will be resistant to that, you also need fiscal policy. And, of course, you need health-care policy too. I didn’t see Madame Lagarde’s comments this morning, but I, I took the sense of that question to be the spread of the disease in Europe, and what do we think about that? Yes. So, as I mentioned in my—in my opening remarks, it’s a concern. We have a widespread spike in cases across the country, more in some regions than others. And even if we don’t have—and I don’t expect that we would—sort of government-imposed restrictions, it does seem likely, though, that people who have maybe begun to engage in activities that they had in flying, staying in a hotel, going to restaurants, going to bars, and, and things like that, that they may pull back in a situation where suddenly the cases are everywhere in your city, your state, your community. So I do think that that’s a risk that we have as we go into the fall now and, and the cases spike. That, that could weigh on economic activity. One would expect that it would. We thought the same thing, in fairness, about the wave we had this summer in the South and the West. And the risk, as I did in my—in my comments.","Q&A","Press Conf","","521","2020-11"
"2020-11-05","Well, we’re doing that with the Municipal Liquidity Facility now, so we’re, we’re buying, you know, with, with our own funds and with the CARES Act funds that, that we’ve gotten through Congress and the Treasury. We’re buying municipal securities of up to three years. So we’re doing that now as part of an emergency facility under section 13(3), you know, which has to meet the emergency requirements of exigent circumstances and which is all clearly laid out in the law. So we’re, we’re actually doing that now. down. It’s no longer working. So we step in under 13(3), and we provide liquidity. What turns out to happen is, we announce a program, and the market starts working. So we only actually have to do a backstop. The amount of financing that’s happened in the municipal markets this year is much higher than it was the prior year, and, and we didn’t do it. We did—we’ve done a very small number of, of loans. But just the fact that we’re there as a backstop seems to—seems to get the private parties to get back together and, and get the market working again. So that’s what 13(3) is for.

"2020-11-05","So it is—obviously, it’s for Congress to decide the timing, size, and components of further fiscal support for the economy, and I will say that the support provided by the CARES Act was absolutely essential in supporting the recovery that we’ve seen so far, which face, and those would be well addressed through more fiscal policy. One is the further spread of the virus, and the other is the lapsing of the CARES Act benefits and the savings on people’s balance sheets that will dwindle. But I, you know, I think it’s appropriate for us not to try to prescribe for Congress exactly what they should do or what the timing of it should be or what the size of it should be and leave it at that.","Q&A","Press Conf","","128","2020-11"

"2020-12-16","Good afternoon. At the Federal Reserve, we are strongly committed to achieving the monetary policy goals that Congress has given us—maximum employment and price stability. Since the beginning of the pandemic, we have taken forceful actions to provide relief and stability, to ensure that the recovery will be as strong as possible, and to limit lasting damage to the economy. Today my colleagues on the FOMC and I reaffirmed our strong forward guidance for interest rates and also provided additional guidance for our asset purchases. Together, these measures will ensure that monetary policy will continue to deliver powerful support to the economy until the recovery is complete. Economic activity has continued to recover from its depressed second-quarter level. The substantial reopening of the economy led to a rapid rebound in activity, and real GDP rose at an annual rate of 33 percent in the third quarter. In recent months, however, the pace of improvement has moderated. Household spending on goods, especially durable goods, has been strong and has moved above its pre-pandemic level. In contrast, spending on services remains low, especially in sectors that typically require people to gather closely, including travel and hospitality. The overall rebound in household spending owes in part to federal stimulus payments and expanded unemployment benefits, which provided essential support to many families and individuals. The housing sector has fully recovered from the downturn, supported in part by low mortgage interest rates. Business investment has also picked up. The recovery has progressed more quickly than generally expected, and forecasts from FOMC participants for economic growth this year have been revised up since our September Summary of Economic Projections. Even so, overall economic activity remains well below its level before the pandemic, and the path ahead remains highly uncertain. activity, the pace of improvement in the labor market has moderated. Job growth slowed to 245,000 in November, and while the unemployment rate has continued to decline, it remains elevated at 6.7 percent. Participation in the labor market remains notably below pre-pandemic levels. Although there has been much progress in the labor market since the spring, we will not lose sight of the millions of Americans who remain out of work. Looking ahead, FOMC participants project the unemployment rate to continue to decline; the median projection is 5 percent at the end of next year and moves below 4 percent by 2023. The economic downturn has not fallen equally on all Americans, and those least able to shoulder the burden have been the hardest hit. In particular, the high level of joblessness has been especially severe for lower-wage workers in the service sector and for African Americans and Hispanics. The economic dislocation has upended many lives and created great uncertainty about the future. The pandemic has also left a significant imprint on inflation. Following large declines in the spring, consumer prices picked up over the summer but have leveled out more recently. For those sectors that have been most adversely affected by the pandemic, prices remain particularly soft. Overall, on a 12-month basis, inflation remains below our 2 percent longer-run objective. The median inflation projection from FOMC participants rises from 1.2 percent this year to 1.8 percent next year and reaches 2 percent in 2023. As we have emphasized throughout the pandemic, the outlook for the economy is extraordinarily uncertain and will depend in large part on the course of the virus. Recent news on vaccines has been very positive. However, significant challenges and uncertainties remain with regard to the timing, production, and distribution of vaccines as well as their efficacy across States and abroad, is particularly concerning, and the next few months are likely to be very challenging. All of us have a role to play in our nation’s response to the pandemic. Following the advice of public health professionals to keep appropriate social distances and to wear masks in public will help get the economy back to full strength. A full economic recovery is unlikely until people are confident that it is safe to engage—reengage in a broad range of activities. As we previously announced, we are now releasing the entire package of our SEP materials at the same time as our FOMC statement. Included in these materials are two new exhibits that show how the balance of participants’ assessments of uncertainty and risks have evolved over time. Since the onset of the pandemic, nearly all participants continue to judge the level of uncertainty about the economic outlook as elevated. In terms of risks to the outlook, fewer participants see the balance of risks as weighted to the downside than in September. While a little more than half of participants now judge risks to be broadly balanced for economic activity, a similar number continue to see risks weighted to the downside for inflation. The Fed’s response to this crisis has been guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people, along with our responsibilities to promote the stability of the financial system. As noted in our Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, we view maximum employment as a broad-based and inclusive goal. Our ability to achieve maximum employment in the years ahead depends importantly on having longer-term inflation expectations well anchored at 2 percent. As we reiterated in today’s statement, with inflation running persistently below 2 percent, we will aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time so that inflation averages 2 percent over time and achieved. With regard to interest rates, we continue to expect it will be appropriate to maintain the current 0 to ¼ percent target range for the federal funds rate until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee’s assessment of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time. In addition, as we noted in today’s policy statement, we will continue to increase our holdings of Treasury securities by at least $80 billion per month and of agency mortgage-backed securities by at least $40 billion per month until substantial further progress has been made toward our maximum-employment and price-stability goals. We believe the increase in our balance sheet this year has materially eased financial conditions and is providing substantial support to the economy. Combined with our forward guidance for the federal funds rate, our enhanced balance sheet guidance will ensure that the stance of monetary policy remains highly accommodative as the recovery progresses. Our guidance is outcome based and is tied to progress toward reaching our employment and inflation goals. Thus, if progress toward our goals were to slow, the guidance would convey our intention to increase policy accommodation through a lower expected path of the federal funds rate and a higher expected path of the balance sheet. Overall, our interest rate and balance sheet tools are providing powerful support to the economy and will continue to do so. The Federal Reserve has also been taking broad and forceful actions to more directly support the flow of credit in the economy for households, for businesses large and small, and for state and local governments. Preserving the flow of credit is essential for mitigating damage to very unusual circumstances, such as those we find ourselves in today. These programs serve as a backstop to key credit markets and have helped to restore the flow of credit from private lenders through normal channels. We have deployed these lending powers to an unprecedented extent, enabled in large part by financial backing and support from Congress and the Treasury. Although funds from the CARES Act will not be available to support new loans or new purchases after—of assets after December 31, the Treasury could authorize support for emerging lending facilities, if needed, through the Exchange Stabilization Fund. When the time comes, after the crisis has passed, we will put these emergency tools back in the box. As I have emphasized before, these are lending powers, not spending powers. The Fed cannot grant money to particular beneficiaries. We can only create programs or facilities with broad-based eligibility to make loans to solvent entities with the expectation that the loans will be repaid. Many borrowers are benefiting from these programs, as is the overall economy. But for many others, getting a loan that may be difficult to repay may not be the answer. In these cases, direct fiscal support may be needed. Elected officials have the power to tax and spend and to make decisions about where we, as a society, should direct our collective resources. The fiscal policy actions that have been taken thus far have made a critical difference to families, businesses, and communities across the country. Even so, the current economic downturn is the most severe of our lifetimes. It will take a while to get back to the levels of economic activity and employment that prevailed at the beginning of this year, and it may take continued support from both monetary and fiscal policy to achieve that. using our full range of tools to support the economy and to help assure that the recovery from this difficult period will be as robust as possible. Thank you.","Opening Statement","Press Conf","","1530","2020-12"
"2020-12-16","Yes. Well, so we’re not—we’re not going to be identifying specific—associating that test with, with specific numbers at this point. So, really, the question is, what do we mean by, by that language? And, really, the overarching message, Rich, is that our guidance for both interest rates and asset purchases will keep monetary policy accommodative until our maximum-employment and price-stability goals are achieved, and that’s, that’s a powerful message. So “substantial further progress” means what it says. It means we’ll be looking for employment to be substantially closer to assessments of its maximum level and inflation to be substantially closer to our 2 percent longer-run goal before we start making adjustments to our purchases. I would also point out that by increasing our asset holdings, we see ourselves as adding policy accommodation. There will come a time when the economy does not require increasing amounts of policy accommodation. And when that time comes—and that will be uncertain and, in any case, is, is some ways off. So I can’t give you an exact set of numbers. We will—of when we would actually consider gradually tapering the pace of purchases.","Q&A","Press Conf","","189","2020-12"

"2020-12-16","Well, Nick, I—on, on the first part of the question, I, I don’t—I wouldn’t want to sort of talk about hypothetical situations. You know, we, we look at our overall stance of policy, we look at overall financial conditions, we look at what’s going on in the economy—different parts of the economy, and we ask ourselves, should we change our policy stance? We do that at every meeting. And we look at where financial conditions are now, we’re providing a great deal, and we think—we happen to think it’s the right amount. And, you know, you, you mentioned—I think you’re referring to the idea of maintaining the duration but, but reducing the quantity, which is sort of what the Bank of Canada did. And that, that is something that we—you know, that we talked about in the last meeting and was addressed in the minutes. And I would say, the views on that were mixed: Some thought it was an interesting idea, others not so much. I, I wouldn’t say that that’s something that’s, that’s high on our list of, of possibilities.","Q&A","Press Conf","","182","2020-12"
"2020-12-16","So, you know, again, I would start with what we actually did at the meeting, which, which was, we provided this, this guidance about the path of asset purchases. And I just went through what, what they—what they—the guidance that we put forward. And, you know, so I guess since September we’ve now adopted a flexible average inflation-targeting framework. We have provided rate guidance that is tightly linked to the goals as expressed in that new framework. And now we’ve done the same for, for asset purchases. So, you know, we’ve, we’ve been sort of—as, as the future has become clearer and as we’ve absorbed new developments in medical—in the medical sphere and also in, in the economy, we have—began to be able to see further. So we’ve, we’ve started to be able to provide further important guidance. And we think that the—that the asset purchase guidance, guidance is very important. We think that the, the prior language of “in coming months” was obviously temporary. This links that guidance, those purchases, to actual “substantial further progress” toward our, our mandated goals. We think that’s important. And we think that that is important to have done. I, I would just add, though, that we also continue to think that our current policy stance is appropriate. We think it’s providing a great deal of support for the economy. Financial conditions are highly accommodative. And, you know, we monitor a range of financial condition indexes. There are many of them, and they’ll, they’ll all pretty much tell you that. well. The parts of the economy that are weak are the service-sector businesses that involve close contact. Those are not being held back by financial conditions, but rather by the spread of the virus. And I’ll close by, by just saying, we do have the flexibility to provide more accommodation through the channel you mentioned and through other channels. And we recognize that circumstances could shift in a way that warrants our, our doing that, including by adjusting purchases. We are committed to using our full range of tools to support the","Q&A","Press Conf","","348","2020-12"
"2020-12-16","Yeah, I mean, that’s—I think we’re a very, very long way from that. You know, the, the Congress has given the Fed independence on the condition that we stick to our knitting. We try very hard to do that. And I, I think that’s, that’s what people call fiscal dominance. And I, I think we’re just a very, very long way from that. I think, you know, if we—if we do our jobs well and support the economy and achieve maximum employment and stable prices, keep the financial system stable, I don’t think that that is something that will—that I would worry about, certainly not in the near term.","Q&A","Press Conf","","109","2020-12"
"2020-12-16","So people who—people who run for elected office and win, they’re the ones—their reward is they get to make those very difficult decisions. And—you know, so we’re not charged with providing fiscal advice to, to Congress. But I, I would just say, as a general—as a general rule, it is important to be on a sustainable fiscal path. For my way of thinking and many others’, the time to focus on that is when the economy is strong and when unemployment is low and taxes are—you know, are, are pouring in, and there’s, there’s room to get on—get on a sustainable path, because the economy’s really doing well. You’re still now in the—in the, you know, some part of, of an economic crisis. And the fact that Congress is debating a fairly large bill today suggests that, that—you know, suggests that something fairly substantial is going to get done, we hope—that what’s being discussed is, you know, is, is of some size. In terms of what is a sustainable level, I think, you know, it’s—the question is—we’ve always looked at debt to GDP, and we’re very high by that measure. By some other measures, we’re actually not that high. In particular, you can look at the real interest rate payments, the amount of, what does it cost? And from that standpoint, if you—if you sort of take real interest costs of the federal deficit and divide that by GDP, we’re actually—you know, we’re actually on a more sustainable fiscal path if you look at it through those eyes. Again, these are—these are issues for Congress. But, you know, I’ll just say in the near term, I think fiscal—the case for, for fiscal is, is strong. And I’m certainly hoping—I think it will be very good for the economy if, if we did get something soon. congressional interference in monetary policymaking or at least feel significant political pressure to keep rates low because the country can’t afford to pay a significant interest bill?","Q&A","Press Conf","","332","2020-12"
"2020-12-16","You, you were breaking up, but I, I think I got that. I think I got it. So, you know, financial stability—we, we look at a broad range of things. We actually have a framework so that we can, you know, be—evaluate changes in financial stability over time, and so that the public can evaluate whether we’re doing a job—a good job at it. We—so what do we look at? Asset prices is one thing that we look at. And, you know, we published a report a few weeks ago on that—maybe it was month or so ago. Anyway. And I think you’ll find a mixed bag there. It depends—with equities, it depends on whether you’re looking at P/Es or whether you’re looking at the premium over risk-free—over the risk-free return. If you look at P/Es, they’re historically high, but, you know, in a world where the— where the risk-free rate is sustain—is going to be low for a sustained period, the equity premium, which is really the reward you get for taking equity risk, would be what you’d look at. And that’s not at, at incredibly low levels, which would mean that they’re not overpriced in that sense. Admittedly, P/Es are high, but that’s—you know, that’s, that’s maybe not as relevant in a world where we think the 10-year Treasury is going to be lower than it’s been historically, from a—from a return perspective. You know, we look at—we also look at borrowing—leverage of financial institutions. We spent 10 years and the banks spent 10 years building up their capital. So far, they’ve been a leverage is high. We’ve been watching that. But, you know, rates are really low. So—and so companies have been able to handle their debt loads even in weak periods, because rates are— rates are quite low. Your interest payments are low. Defaults and downgrades have, have declined since earlier in the year. Households came into this very strong, and there certainly has been a hit there for people who are unemployed. But, you know, with the CARES Act, Congress replaced a lot of lost income. You know, it’s very important that, that the economy gets strong again. I mean, the, the ultimate thing to support financial stability is a strong economy. The last thing is, is really funding markets. We found that there was a lot of unstable funding for companies, particularly financial companies. And that’s, that’s down to a—to a very low level these days. So the broad financial stability picture is, is kind of mixed, I would say. I would say, you know, asset prices are, are a little high in that metric and in my view. But, overall, you have a mixed picture. You, you don’t have, you know, a lot of red flags on that. So—and it’s—again, it’s something that we monitor essentially ongoing, almost daily. You know, we’re, we’re monitoring these prices for that and, and have published our, our framework, and, you know, we’ll be held accountable for what we saw and what we missed. So we work very hard at it.","Q&A","Press Conf","","514","2020-12"
"2020-12-16","So, you know, we’ve had a—and I’ve had sort of the typical meetings with the transition team for Treasury. They’ve met with quite a lot of people in our agency and other agencies. And, really, it’s about learning what we do. And I, I really have only spoken to former Chair Yellen to congratulate her on being nominated and just to say that I look forward to working with her. You know, I did work very closely with her for five years before she left and have stayed in touch, you know. So I did that. But I have not discussed, you know, policy with her. And I, I’m not going to do that until she’s confirmed.","Q&A","Press Conf","","117","2020-12"
"2020-12-16","So that, that has all the markings of a transient increase in the price level. So you can imagine that as people really want to travel again—let’s say, you know, that airfare, airfares—I’m just imagining this, right?—that they go up. But what inflation is, is a process whereby they go up year upon year upon year upon year. And if—given the inflation dynamics that we’ve had over the last several decades, just a single, single sort of price-level increase has not resulted in ongoing price-level increases. And that, that was—the problem back in the 1970s was, it was the combination of two things. One, when unemployment went down and resources got tight, prices started going up. But the second problem was that that—that that increase was persistent, there was a level of persistence. So if prices went up 6 percent this year, they’d go up 6 percent next year, because people would internalize. I mean, really, really, that’s what happens is, people internalize that they can raise prices, and that it’s okay to pay prices that are going up at that rate. So that was the inflation—those are the inflation dynamics of that era. there, but it’s a—it’s a faint heartbeat compared to what it was. And the persistence of inflation, if you—if you get a—for example, oil prices go up, and that’ll send a temporary shock through the economy. The persistence of that into, into inflation over time is just not there. So they— what you describe may happen, and, of course, we would watch it very carefully. We, we understand that we will always be learning new things from the economy about how it will behave in certain cases. But I would—I would expect, though, going in that that would be a one-time price increase rather than an increase in underlying inflation that would be persistent.","Q&A","Press Conf","","308","2020-12"
"2020-12-16","Right. So I, I could go back, James, to what I said earlier, which is, this is—this is a very, very large asset purchase program. It’s providing a tremendous amount of, of support for the economy. If you look at the interest-sensitive parts of the economy, they’re performing very well. The parts that are not performing well are not struggling from high So, so we, we do have the ability to—you know, to buy more bonds or to buy longer-term bonds. And, and we may—we may use it. I’m not saying we won’t—we won’t use that. It may well come to, to using that. But also, I would remind—I would also note, though, monetary policy works with “long and variable lags,” is the famous statement. So we think that the big effects from monetary policy are, you know, months and months into the future. So this looks like a—you know, it looks like a time when what is really needed is fiscal policy. And, and that’s why it is, is a very positive thing that, that we’re getting that. So we, we remain open to doing—you know, to, to either increasing the size of our asset purchases, if that turns out to be appropriate, or to just moving the maturities, moving to buying longer maturities, because that had—that also increases accommodation by taking more duration risk out of the market. But we think our current stance is appropriate. And we think that our— you know, that our, our guidance on asset purchases today will also provide support to the economy over time. Again, what we’ve—what we’ve done is, we’ve laid out a path whereby we’re going to keep monetary policy highly accommodative for a long time, really until—really until we reach very close to our goals, which is not, you know, not really the way it’s been done in the past. So that’s, that’s providing significant support for the economy now. We don’t think the economy suffers from a lack of, of highly accommodative financial conditions. We think it’s suffering from the pandemic and people wanting to not engage in certain kinds of economic activity. And we expect that, that with the virus, that that will improve—that condition will improve. Nonetheless, again, we will—are prepared to use our","Q&A","Press Conf","","378","2020-12"
"2020-12-16","Okay. So the state and local governments, they provide important critical services: safety, fire, police, health, all kinds of things like that. They’re, they’re really involved in people’s lives, state and local governments are, to, to a large extent. The decision whether to, to provide more fiscal support to them is entirely in the hands of Congress. And, you know, they’re in the middle of these discussions, and, and those, those are issues for them to decide. I would say that the picture is mixed. What’s happened is, if you’re a state that has a significant exposure to tourism or to extracting energy from the ground—oil from the ground, or gas—you are probably, at least in those industries, feeling a significant loss of revenue. A number of other states have been surprised on the upside, where—and that’s because goods sales, for example—property taxes are—don’t move much year to year. And, you know, the kind of sales taxes on goods—goods sales have been very high. Income has been more or less replaced by, by the CARES Act—fully replaced, more than, in many cases. So the concerns that we had at the very beginning of really serious, deep shortfalls and massive budget cuts on the part of state and local governments have not yet—have not yet occurred. What we’re seeing is, is that it’s different state to state. And some states are having significant difficulties, others not so much. The real concern, though, that still emerges is, state and local governments are very large employers, and—one of the largest. And so far, since the pandemic began, employment has lost their jobs during the Global Financial Crisis. So that is—that is a significant—a significant part of that group is, is in education. So when the schools reopen, a significant part of that 1.3 million would go back to work. Nonetheless, it’s a concern. We’re, we’re watching carefully to understand why that—why that many people have been let go and what are—really are the sources. So we’re monitoring it carefully, and it’s a mixed picture. And I, I just have to leave the question of what to do with fiscal policy on this to Congress.","Q&A","Press Conf","","361","2020-12"

Yes, I, I don’t think it’s at all a foregone conclusion that there needs to be a time when the economy needs highly accommodative monetary policy, and we think our asset purchases are, you know, one of the main delivery mechanisms for that, the size of the balance sheet.

You know, it depends on your assumptions, such as how many people will actually take the vaccine and how fast will the rollout be. So it’s assumption based on assumption based on assumption. But, you know, sometime—it’s possible sometime in the middle or second half of next year. I’m not going to try to be precise, because it’s just another estimate. You know, our people are very good, but they’re looking at, at the same data as other people are. And so, you know, all the estimates are—it depends on what your assumptions are. But under a normal set of assumptions, it could happen as, as soon as the middle of next year. In terms of the, you know, inflation, a couple things—your second question. You know, we’re—I think you have to be honest with yourself about, about inflation these days. There are—there are significant disinflationary pressures around the world, and there have been for a while, and they persist today. It’s, is not going to be easy to have inflation move up. And it isn’t going to be just a question—it’s going to take some time. It took a long time to get inflation back to 2 percent in the last crisis. high levels of asset purchases, it will take some time, because that’s what we believe the underlying inflation dynamics are in our economy. And that’s sort of why we’re—one reason why we’re concerned about inflation is that we see that. And, and that’s why we have adopted the flexible average inflation-targeting framework. That’s why we’re aiming for an overshoot. But we’re, we’re honest with ourselves and with the public that it will take some time to get there. In terms of, you know, would, would it really speed it up a lot to, to move asset purchases, you know, I don’t think that would really be—I think it’s going to take a long time however you do it. And, you know, we’ve been having very long expansions since—in, in the last several decades because inflation has not—really, the old model was, inflation would come along and the Fed would tighten, and we’d have a recession. Now inflation has been low, and we haven’t had that dynamic. And the result has been three of the four longest expansions in, in modern history, in recorded history. So, you know, we’re, we’re thinking that this could be another long expansion, and that we’ll keep our—what we’re saying is, we’re going to keep policy highly accommodative until the expansion is well down the tracks. And we’re not going to preemptively raise rates until we see inflation actually reaching 2 percent and being on track to exceed 2 percent. That’s a very strong commitment, and we think that’s the right place to be.","Q&A","Press Conf","","495","2020-12"
"2020-12-16","There is more that we can do, certainly. We can—we can expand our, our asset purchase programs. We can focus them more on the longer end. There are a number of options we would have to provide more support to the economy. So I would—I would say, though, that in the near term, the help that people need isn’t just from low interest rates that stimulates demand over time and works with long and variable lags. It’s really support. As the—as—we’ve, we’ve talked about this as all of these government across it. But there’s a group for, for which they, they don’t have a bridge yet. And that’s who we’re talking about here. It’s, it’s the 10 million people who lost their jobs. It’s people who may lose their homes. It’s—you know, you see the, the—many, many millions of Americans are, are waiting in food lines in their cars these days all over the country. So we know there’s need out there. We know there are small businesses all over the country that, that have been basically unable to really function, and they’re just hanging on. So—and, and they’re, they’re so critical to our economy. So—and, by the way, now that we can—we can kind of see the light at the end of the tunnel, it would be—it would be bad to see, you know, people losing their business, their life’s work in many cases, or even generations’ worth of work, because they couldn’t last another few months, which is what it amounts to. So we have more we can do. And we’ll—I, I think more the issue is, we’re going to need to continue to provide support to this economy for quite a period of time, because the, the economy will be growing in expectation. We should be growing at a fairly healthy clip by the second half of next year. But it’s going to be a while before we really are back to the levels of, of labor market—the, the sort of conditions in the labor market that we had in early this year and for much of the last couple of years. So that’s how I think about it.","Q&A","Press Conf","","362","2020-12"
"2020-12-16","You know, so we monitor basically just about every asset price in the economy, and housing prices are something that we’ve been monitoring. And you see them moving up. You see very high demand. This, this is the housing market that people have been expecting since, you know, 2010. And, and then, you know, not many, when the—when the pandemic hit, thought, “Oh, this is what—this is what will produce that housing market,” but it has. builders are going to bring forth supply. There’s also a sense that this—some of this may be pent-up demand from when the economy was closed, which would imply that demand—once that demand is met, that the real level of demand will be more manageable. So it’s a—it’s a healthy economy now. We, we met recently with a bunch of homebuilders, and many of them in the business 30, 40 years said they’ve never seen the likes of it. But, no, housing prices themselves are not—are not a financial stability concern at the moment. We will watch that carefully. But in the near term, I wouldn’t think that that’s an issue that we’d be concerned about.","Q&A","Press Conf","","191","2020-12"
"2020-12-16","Okay. So on, on fiscal policy, I would just say a couple of things. The case for fiscal policy right now is, is very, very strong. And I think that is widely understood, I would say, now. The details of it are entirely up to Congress. But with the businesses to have, have fiscal support. And I do think that—again, I think that is widely understood. So I think it would be—I, I certainly would welcome the work that Congress is doing right now. It’s not up to us to judge that work. It’s really, really theirs. And I, I don’t have a view for you on, on the size of it. It’s—you know, it’s obviously a substantial bill. On the surge, you know, so it’s a really interesting question. We have, and others too, have consistently expected there to be more economic—that, that cases would hold—growth in cases would hold back the economy more than it actually has. So we’ve overestimated the, the effects on the economy of, of these spikes we’ve been having. Now, this spike is so much larger that I think—and I think forecasters generally do think that there—that this will have an effect on suppressing activity, particularly activity that involves people getting together in bars and restaurants, on airplanes and hotels and things like that. And you’re starting to see that. In the—in the high-frequency data, you’re now beginning to see that show up. And I think if this is—the case numbers are so high and so widespread across the country that that, that seems like it must happen. Now, how big will it be? We don’t—we don’t really know. You know, there are—there are a lot of estimates. The general expectation is, you’re seeing some slowing now. And you’ll see the first quarter could well be—what, what we said is that coming months are going to be challenging. The first quarter will, will certainly show significant effects from this. At the same time, people are getting vaccinated now. They’re getting vaccinated. And by the end of the first quarter into the second quarter, you’re going to be seeing significant numbers of people vaccinated. And so then what will be—how will that play into economic in a broader range of activities. And some people will be probably quick to do that. Some are doing it now without a vaccine—right?—in many parts of the country. So, nonetheless, my expectation—and I think many people have the expectation that the second half of next year should—the economy should be performing strongly. We should be— you know, we should be getting people back to work. Businesses should be reopening and that kind of thing. The issue is more the next four or five months—getting through the next four, five, six months. That is key. And, and, you know, clearly there’s going to be need for help there. And, and, you know, my sense and hope is that we’ll be getting that.","Q&A","Press Conf","","492","2020-12"

"2020-12-16","So the—you’re, you’re talking about the—sorry, the Network [of Central Banks and Supervisors] for Greening the Financial System, which we joined this week. And I’ll just—I’ll just say a couple things about that. So, first, I’ll just start by saying that we’re going to move carefully and thoughtfully on developing an understanding of how climate change affects our work, including the areas you mentioned. We’re going to do so with a great deal of engagement with all of our external constituencies, including the public and their elected representatives who are charged with our oversight. We’ll do it with great transparency. vigorously. We’re not the forum where all the great issues of the day are to be hashed out, debated, and addressed unless and only to the extent that those issues are directly relevant to our statutory goals and are addressable through our legal authorities. And because we have a narrow remit, and because we stick to it, Congress has given us a precious grant of independence from direct political control. So society’s broad response to climate change is for others to decide—in particular, elected leaders. But—so let me—let me get to your question. What does all that mean for an issue like climate change? And why did we join the NGFS? So Congress hasn’t explicitly assigned us or other financial regulators a role, and we’re not among the agencies who contribute to the National Climate Assessment—Climate Assessment, for example. But climate change is nonetheless relevant to our existing mandates under the law. And let me tell you why. One of our jobs is to regulate and supervise banks and to look after the stability of the financial system. That’s a responsibility we share with other agencies. The public will expect that we will—we will do that. So we’ll, we’ll expect that, that those important institutions will be resilient against the many resists—risks that they fake—face: credit risk, market risk, cyber risk. Climate change is an emerging risk to financial institutions, the financial system, and the economy. And we are, as so many others are, in the very early stages of understanding what that means, what needs to be done about it, and by whom. That’s why 83 central banks have joined together to share research and identify best practices in this important emerging area. We’ve been attending NGFS meetings as an observer for more than a year, taking part in the work. We had discussed that it was probably time to join as a member. just beginning to develop our, our understanding. You asked about monetary policy. You know, I—I’ll say this. We, we have historically shied away strongly from taking a role in credit allocation. In fact, our agreement with Treasury during the financial crisis from back in 2009 or ’10 says that we will avoid credit allocation. It’s something we’ve carefully avoided. So I, I would be very reluctant to see us move in that direction, picking one area as creditworthy and another not. So you asked about monetary policy. You know, it’s, it’s—for now, I would say the real—the real concern is—the real place to focus, for me, is supervision of financial institutions and then financial stability concerns. You can see a connection there. Monetary policy, maximum employment, stable prices—it’s less obvious to me. I can—I can, you know—I can make the argument, but it’s less obvious to me that those should be first-order things that we would look at in connection with climate change. But I think there’s—I think there’s work to be done to understand the connection between climate change and the strength and resilience of financial markets and financial institutions. I think that work is in its early days. And, again, we’ll be careful. We’ll be thorough and transparent and, and engage with the public on all that.","Q&A","Press Conf","","634","2020-12"
"2021-01-27","I strongly agree with that, as a matter of fact. I think if you look at either—look at employment gaps or unemployment gaps or wage gaps, wealth gaps, homeowning gaps, all of those persistent gaps that exist even controlling for many other factors, you will see that they’re, they’re persistent, they’re—and they’re very difficult to explain. And so it’s—the reason we talk about inequality and, and racial inequality in particular, is that it goes to our job, which is to achieve maximum employment, which, which links up with, with—we want—we want the potential output of the United States to be as high as it can possibly be.

"2021-01-27","Well, yes. So I think, if you go back to the—to the beginning, there was a real concern. I mean, just, just take the financial markets, for example. Suddenly, all of those big buildings all over the, the—New York City and all around the world where people work in the financial markets with terminals and everything, everybody had to go home, and they had to take their terminals with them. And I think there was a real concern that there would be a tremendous loss of functionality just at the time when the financial markets were under floors or on virtual trading floors. Now, some of that’s reversing now. But we have definitely learned that we can do more work from home in many, many different lines of work. Of course, that’s not possible if your job involves being at a place, doing personal services. For many people, it’s not possible. And that’s very much something that skews to higher-income, higher-educated people being able to work from home and others not so much. So I think we’ve learned that. The other thing, though, even conditional on that, when we saw the wave in the South and the West, the wave of cases this summer, I think, intuitively, having seen what happened in March and April, we expected there to be a significant hit to economic activity. And people kind of just got on with their lives and went and, and dealt with it. And, and it didn’t actually—it had a much smaller effect on economic activity than we expected. Then comes the fall wave, which is just so much larger—a very, very large wave as, as was very much forecast. People going indoors, the cold weather, all of that. And even there, if you look at—I would say, look at the December jobs report. So, big job losses in, you know, in that part of the service sector. So I mentioned 400,000 jobs in bars and restaurants. There’s another 100,000 in similar kinds of activities. But if you go—if you look elsewhere, it’s not having an effect. You know, even purchasing manager index and sentiment indexes on, on areas of the economy that are not directly—really directly—exposed to the pandemic in their economic activity, they’re doing okay. They are. Housing is a great example. You know, the way—the way—the way the housing industry worked, that when you buy a house, there was a lot of in-person contact. They managed that it’s, it’s now quite virtual rather than in person. So there’s been a lot of adapting, and—but you can’t adapt, you know, hotels, sporting venues, movie theaters, restaurants, bars. You just—you know, those are just going to—and that’s—again, that’s millions and millions of people. And so you’re just going to have to defeat the pandemic, which, as I mentioned, you know, we, we have a plan to do that, but we haven’t done it yet. And we need to—we need to finish the job. And we—it’s, it’s within our power to do that as a country this year. And I would just urge that—and I know people are working hard on that. But that, that is really the main thing about the economy, is, is getting the pandemic under control, getting everyone vaccinated, getting people wearing masks, and all that. That’s the single most important economic growth policy that we can have. Thank you.","Q&A","Press Conf","","564","2021-01"

"2021-01-27","You know, the, the, the big thing is that the jury’s out. And this has been a concern since the very beginning, is the concern that people—if, if they become disconnected from the industry or the job where—that they used to work in, it, it can be years or never when they get back into the labor force, particularly for people who are well along in their careers—the same kind of scarring for small businesses, which don’t have the kind of resources that you need to get through this. So we’ve, we’ve had a big concern about, about both of those. We haven’t seen as much of it as we—as we feared. And that’s a good thing. But as I said that, you know, the jury is out here—9 or 10 million people still out of work because of the pandemic. They’re—a big chunk of them are people who worked in public-facing jobs in the service sector. And, you know, they’ve gotten a lot of support from fiscal policy and some from monetary policy. But the question is getting them back to work. And, you know, it’s, it’s harder if you’re—it takes longer, empirically, to find that next job if you’re looking at a brand-new industry. It’s not easy to change careers completely midcareer. So that just, again, stresses the to fly on airplanes, to go to sporting events and movie theaters, and all of those things. So those people are still at risk. And we’re, we’re very, very focused on that group of people with our policy and, and, and, you know, the way we look at the economy. So many people have had that bridge across the pandemic. You know, we talked about that at the beginning. For many people, it’s clear that they’ve made it across, and their job is okay, and their house is okay. And, you know, it’s been terribly inconvenient and painful, and schools are closed and things like that. But there, there’s a bunch of people yet who haven’t found that bridge yet. And we’re, we’re very focused on that. Of course, the other thing is, we’re going to a different economy. And we’re going to be learning more about that as we go. But, clearly, we’re, we’re learning that things can be done from remote locations. We’re learning that technology can replace people even more than we thought. And some of that is happening. So I think as we, you know, as we get into this, you know, the phase after—even after the economy fully reopens, I think we’re still going to need to keep people in mind whose lives have been disrupted, because they’ve lost that—the work that they did. And I think it would be wise as a country, for the longer-run productive capacity of the country, if we were to look out for those people and help them find their way back into the labor force even if it means continuing support for an additional period of time.","Q&A","Press Conf","","499","2021-01"

"2021-01-27","So we, we monitor pretty much all of the big financial markets pretty carefully. And, you know, what’s happened in, in the corporate debt market, beginning with the announcement of our corporate credit facility, has been, you’ve seen lenders lending and borrowers borrowing. You’ve seen relatively significantly fewer defaults than we—than we expected. There were a lot of downgrades and some defaults at the beginning, and those have really slowed down. And, by the way, the same is true for bank loans. Banks are not experiencing the kinds of defaults that, that we all were concerned about in the early months of the pandemic. It’s just not materializing. So they’re having to reverse some of their loss reserves, actually. Debts—corporate debt spreads are, are tight. They’ve tightened. They were very broad—high—wide, of course, at the—during the acute phase of the pandemic, and they’ve— you know, they’re now at the lower end of their typical range. And we do monitor that. You know, it’s, it’s not something we can control or operate on directly, but we do—we do watch those things. And, you know, in a sense, it’s good that companies have been able to finance themselves during this period, because they—they’ve been able to stay in business.

All of those things will go into our assessment of what the right answer is to that question. stress tests have taken very, very large reserves—very large loss reserves, and also increased their capital. They’ve actually had—they have higher capital ratios now than they had at the beginning of the pandemic. So the banking system has held up well here.

So we’ve had a very strong rebound in housing. Some of the, the tightness in housing markets, we think—which has led to the, the significant price increases this year—we think is, is a passing phenomenon. There was a lot of pent-up demand. There’s a one-time thing happening with people who are spending all of their time in their house, and they’re thinking either “I need a bigger house” or “I need another house and a different house—or a second house,” in some cases. So there’s just—there’s a—there’s a one- time shift in demand that we think will get satisfied—also, that will call forth supply. And that So you asked about corporate debt, I guess?","Q&A","Press Conf","","140","2021-01"
"2021-01-27","So, on inflation, a couple of things—there are a couple of things that are worth mentioning. One is just that we know that we measure inflation on a trailing 12-month basis. And as we—as we lap the very low inflation readings of March and April of last year, we’ll see measured 12-month inflation move up a few tenths. This is just—they’re called base effects, and, and that’s a—that’s a transient thing that we think will pass. There’s also the possibility—indeed, it’s in some forecasts—that as the economy fully reopens, there’ll be a burst of spending, and—because people will be enthusiastic that the pandemic is over, potentially, and that that could also create some upward pressure on inflation. Now, again, we would see that as something likely to be transient and not to be very large. In both cases, we don’t see those as either lasting or particularly large. So the way we would react is, we’re going to be patient. Expect us to wait and see and not react if we see small and what we would review—we would view as very likely to be transient effects on inflation. I think if you—you know, it helps to look back at, at the inflation dynamics that the United States has had now for some decades and notice that there has been, you know, significant disinflationary pressure for some time, for a couple of decades. Inflation has averaged less than 2 percent for a quarter of a century. And the inflation dynamics, with the flat Phillips curve and low persistence of inflation, is very much intact. Those things, they change over time. We understand that inflation dynamics evolve constantly over time, but they don’t Of course, if we did get sustained inflation at a level that was uncomfortable, we have tools for that. It’s far harder to deal with, with too low inflation. We know what to do with higher inflation, which is, you know, should the need arise, we, we would have those tools. And we don’t expect to see that at all. In terms of how much, you know, what we’ve said is we’d like to see—because inflation has been running persistently below 2 percent, we’d like to see it run moderately above 2 percent for some time. We have not adopted a formula. We’re not going to adopt a formula. We’re going to—we, we use policy rules and formulas in everything we do, consult them constantly, but we don’t set policy by them. We don’t do that. And so we’re going to preserve an element of judgment. And, again, we’ll seek inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time. And we’ll, we’ll show what that means when we get inflation above 2 percent. The, the way to achieve credibility on that is to actually do it. And so that’s what we’re planning on doing.","Q&A","Press Conf","","475","2021-01"
"2021-01-27","Let me—let me provide a little context. The shock that the—from the pandemic was unprecedented both in its nature and in its size and in the amount of unemployment that it created and in the shock to economic activity. There’s nothing close to it in our modern economic history. So our response was really to that. And we—we’ve done what we could, first, to restore market function and to provide a bit of relief, then to support the recovery. And, hopefully, we’ll be able to do the third thing, which is to avoid longer-run damage to the—to the economy. Our role assigned by Congress is maximum employment and stable prices and also look after financial stability. So, in a world where, almost a year later, we’re, we’re still 9 million jobs, at least—that’s one way of counting it; it can actually be counted much higher than that— short of maximum employment and people are out of the labor force who were in the labor support maximum employment and price stability, which is getting inflation back to 2 percent and averaging 2 percent over time. So, on, on matters of financial stability, we have a framework. We don’t look at one thing or two things. We look at—and we made that framework public after the financial crisis so that it could be criticized and understood and we could be held accountable. And, you know, the things that we look at are—we do look at asset prices. We also look at leverage in the banking system. We look at leverage in the non—the nonbanking system, which is to say, corporates and households. And we look at also funding risk. And if you look at it across that range of, of, of readings, they’re each different, but we monitor them carefully. And I would say that financial stability vulnerabilities overall are moderate. Our overall goal is to assure that the financial system itself is resilient to, to shocks of all kinds, that it’s strong and resilient. And that includes not just the banks, but money market funds and, and all different kinds of nonbank financial structures as well. So when we get to the nonfinancial sector, we don’t—we don’t have jurisdiction over that. But—so I would just say that our—that there are many things that go in, as you know, to, to setting asset prices. So if you look at what’s really been driving asset prices, really, in the last couple of months, it isn’t monetary policy. It’s been expectations about vaccines. And it’s also financial—sorry, fiscal policy. Those are—those are the news items that have been driving, driving asset purchases—sorry, asset values in, in recent months. So I, I know that monetary policy does play a role there, but that’s how we look at it.

"2021-01-27","Thank you. So I guess I’d start by saying that the, the fiscal response that we’ve seen to this downturn has been strong, and I think we can say now that it’s been sustained after the passage of the—of the, the most recent act in, in late December. And that’s really a key reason why the recovery has been as strong as it’s been. Fiscal policy has been absolutely essential. When we look back on, on the history of this period, we’ll see a strong and sustained fiscal policy response. I would—I would add that we’re, as I mentioned, a long way from a full recovery. Something like 9 million people remain unemployed as a consequence of the pandemic. That’s as many people as lost their jobs at the peak of the Global Financial Crisis and the Great Recession. Many small businesses are under pressure, and there are other needs to be addressed. And the path ahead is still pretty uncertain. now.

In terms of macroprudential policy tools, so, as you know, no doubt, we rely on sort of always-on, through-the-cycle macroprudential policy tools, particularly the stress tests and also the elevated levels of liquidity and capital and, and, and also resolution planning that we—that we impose on the largest financial institutions. We don’t use time-varying tests and tools as some other countries do. And we think it’s a good approach because—for us to use ones that are always-on—because we don’t really think we’d be successful in every case in picking the exact right time to intervene in markets. So that’s for banks. You really asked about nonbanks, the nonbank sector. And so we monitor financial conditions very broadly. And while we don’t have jurisdiction over, over many areas in the nonbank sector, other agencies do. And so we do coordinate through the Financial Stability Oversight Council and with other agencies who have responsibility for, for nonbank supervision. pandemic really appeared in the nonbank sector.

"2021-01-27","Consumer price inflation through November—as measured by the 12‑month percentage change in the PCE price index—remained considerably lower than the rates seen in early 2020.","Staff Review of Economic Situation","Minutes","N/A","25","2021-01"
"2021-01-27","Good afternoon. At the Federal Reserve, we are strongly committed to achieving the monetary policy goals that Congress has given us: maximum employment and price stability. Since the beginning of the pandemic, we have taken forceful actions to provide relief and stability, to ensure that the recovery will be as strong as possible, and to limit lasting damage to the economy. Today my colleagues on the FOMC and I kept interest rates near zero and maintained our sizable asset purchases. These measures, along with our strong guidance on interest rates and our balance sheet, will ensure that monetary policy will continue to deliver powerful support to the economy until the recovery is complete. The path of the economy continues to depend significantly on the course of the virus. A resurgence in recent months in COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths is causing great hardship for millions of Americans and is weighing on economic activity and job creation. Following a sharp rebound in economic activity last summer, the pace of the recovery has moderated in recent months, with the weakness concentrated in the sectors of the economy most adversely affected by the resurgence of the virus and by greater social distancing. Household spending on services remains low, especially in sectors that typically require people to gather closely, including travel and hospitality. And household spending on goods has moderated following earlier large gains. In contrast, the housing sector has more than fully recovered from the downturn, supported in part by low mortgage interest rates. Business investment and manufacturing production have also picked up. The overall recovery in economic activity since last spring is due in part to federal stimulus payments and expanded unemployment benefits, which have provided essential support to many families and individuals. The recently enacted Coronavirus ahead remains highly uncertain. As with overall economic activity, the pace of improvement in the labor market has slowed in recent months. Employment fell by 140,000 in December, as continued gains in many industries were outweighed by significant losses in industries where the resurgence of the virus has weighed further on activity. In particular, the leisure and hospitality sector lost nearly half a million jobs, largely from restaurants and bars. The unemployment rate remained elevated at 6.7 percent in December, and participation in the labor market is notably below pre-pandemic levels. Although there has been much progress in the labor market since the spring, millions of Americans remain out of work. The economic downturn has not fallen equally on all Americans, and those least able to shoulder the burden have been the hardest hit. In particular, the high level of joblessness has been especially severe for lower-wage workers in the service sector and for African Americans and Hispanics. The economic dislocation has upended many lives and created great uncertainty about the future. The pandemic has also left a significant imprint on inflation. Following large declines in the spring, consumer prices picked up over the summer but have leveled out more recently. For those sectors that have been most adversely affected by the pandemic, prices remain particularly soft. Overall, on a 12-month basis, inflation remains below our 2 percent longer-run objective. While we should not underestimate the challenges we currently face, several developments point to an improved outlook for later this year. Sufficiently widespread vaccinations would enable us to put the pandemic behind us and return to more normal economic activities. In the meantime, continued observance of social-distancing measures and wearing that could otherwise impede the recovery. In addition, as we have seen since last summer, the economy has proved more resilient than expected, in part reflecting the adaptability of households and businesses. Finally, monetary policy is playing a key role in supporting the recovery and will continue to do so. The Fed’s response to this crisis has been guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people, along with our responsibilities to promote the stability of the financial system. Today we unanimously reaffirmed our Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, as we typically do each January. As we say in that statement, we view maximum employment as a “broad-based and inclusive goal.” Our ability to achieve maximum employment in the years ahead depends importantly on having longer-term inflation expectations well anchored at 2 percent. As the Committee reiterated in today’s policy statement, with inflation running persistently below 2 percent, we will aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time so that inflation averages 2 percent over time and longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2 percent. We expect to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until these employment and inflation outcomes are achieved. With regard to interest rates, we continue to expect it will be appropriate to maintain the current 0 to ¼ percent target range for the federal funds rate until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee’s assessment of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time. In addition, we will continue to increase our holdings of Treasury securities by at least $80 billion per month and of agency mortgage-backed since last March has materially eased financial conditions and is providing substantial support to the economy. The economy is a long way from our employment and inflation goals, and it is likely to take some time for substantial further progress to be achieved. Our forward guidance for the federal funds rate, along with our balance sheet guidance, will ensure that the stance of monetary policy remains highly accommodative as the recovery progresses. Our guidance is outcome based and ties the path of the federal funds rate and the balance sheet to progress toward reaching our employment and inflation goals. Thus, if progress toward our goals were to slow, the guidance would convey our intention to increase policy accommodation through a lower expected path of the federal funds rate and a higher expected path of the balance sheet. Overall, our interest rate and balance sheet tools are providing powerful support to the economy and will continue to do so. We’ve also taken actions to more directly support the flow of credit in the economy, deploying our emergency lending powers to an unprecedented extent, enabled in large part by financial backing and support from Congress and the Treasury. Although the CARES Act facilities are no—are no longer open to new activity, our other facilities remain in place. To conclude, we understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission. We are committed to using our full range of tools to support the economy and to help assure that the recovery from this difficult period will be as robust as possible. Thank you.","Opening Statement","Press Conf","","1139","2021-01"
"2021-01-27","Yes. So, you know, I, I was here—we had all the same questions back in—after the Global Financial Crisis. We raised interest rates. We froze the balance sheet size, and then we shrank the balance sheet size. So there’s no reason why we, we won’t be able to do that again. In fact, we learned a lot from that experience. And, you know, we, we understand—as we understood then, but even more so—we understand that the—that the way to do it is to communicate well in advance, to, to do predictable things, and to move gradually. And that’s, that’s what we’re going to do. We’re going to be very transparent. But, honestly, no—you know, the whole focus on exit is premature, if I may say. We’re focused on finishing the job we’re doing, which is to support the economy, to give the economy the support it needs. There are people out there who’ve lost their jobs. It’s essential that we get them back to work as quickly as possible, and we want to do everything we can to do that. And that is our primary focus right now. It’s, it’s, it’s too soon to be—to be worried about that. You know, when we come to exit, we have a—we have an understanding of how to do that, and we’ll do it very carefully. But in the meantime, our focus is on giving the economy the support it needs.","Q&A","Press Conf","","238","2021-01"
"2021-01-27","I, I would say that, again, we have been struggling with disinflationary forces for some time. If you look around the world—look in Western Europe, look at Japan—around the world, large economies have, have felt much more downward pressure on inflation, have fallen short of their inflation goals, for some time now. That is the broad global macroeconomic context that we all live in. And we believe that those global forces—which are, you know, aging demographics, advancing technology, and globalization—those, those forces are still in effect. Now, they may slow down, and, and it’s, it’s an interesting question, the extent to which, for example, globalization may slow down or even reverse. Notwithstanding that, inflation dynamics in the United States have, have consisted of a flat Phillips curve and low persistence for, for a long time. We do not expect in the near term that that will change significantly. It may evolve over time, but significant time. You know, these things are—these things are, are changing, but they don’t change at a rapid rate. And there’s—I, I don’t believe that, that they will. So I wouldn’t—I’m, I’m not—I’m much more worried about falling short of a complete recovery and losing people’s careers and lives that they—that they built because they don’t get to work—back to work in time and things like that. I’m more concerned about that and the damage that will do not just to their lives, but to the United States economy, to the productive capacity of the economy. I’m more concerned about that than about the possibility, which exists, of higher inflation. Frankly, we welcome slightly higher inflation, somewhat higher inflation. The kind of troubling inflation that people like me grew up with seems, seems far away and unlikely in, in the both domestic and global context that we’ve been in for some time. employees yesterday, spoke of the close working relationship with the Federal Reserve. And I’m wondering how you would describe the relationship with, with Treasury under Chair Yellen, if you’ve met with, with, with Treasury Secretary Yellen and, and/or President Biden since he has taken office. And, you know, secondly, about that, as you know, in the last four years, there was constant criticism from the—of the Fed from the President and from other officials of the Administration. Do you have any kind of assurance or expectation that this will now be more of a hands-off attitude, in terms of commenting on monetary policy from the Administration?","Q&A","Press Conf","","412","2021-01"
"2021-01-27","Okay. So I have the highest respect and admiration for Secretary Yellen. And I’m, I’m sure that we’re going to have a, a good working relationship together. Absolutely sure. We’ll also have a good institutional relationship between the Fed and the Treasury. And I expect that that’ll be very good and, and very productive. It’ll be collaborative. We’ll work together. Now, the way that works is, is that, you know, we know—the agencies know each other well, and this is true of finance ministries and central banks around the world. We know to stay in our lanes. We know we have different authorities. We know that we work together on some things to—you know, for the benefit of the public. And I’m, I’m absolutely sure that we’re going to do that. I, you know, haven’t—I haven’t spoken to, to Secretary Yellen—I’m going to be calling her “Chair Yellen” most of the time, so you just have to be patient with me—Secretary Yellen. I haven’t spoken to her since I congratulated her on being nominated. I do expect very soon to meetings, lunches, breakfast, calls, depending on the situation. So I expect that will—that will happen soon. I’ve—I have not met the, the President, President Biden. And just, you know, I, I, I don’t—I don’t have any comment on your—on your last question. I wouldn’t want to comment one way or the other.","Q&A","Press Conf","","232","2021-01"
"2021-01-27","So, you know, that’s—as you know, that’s one of the very difficult questions in all of monetary policy. And we don’t rule it out as a theoretical matter, but we, we clearly look to macroprudential tools, regulatory tools, supervisory tools, other kinds of tools rather than monetary policy in, in addressing financial stability issues. It’s not—you know, the, the monetary policy we know strengthens economic activity and job creation through fairly well- understood channels. And a strong economy is actually a great supporter of financial stability. That will mean strong, you know, well-capitalized institutions, and, and households will be— will be working. And, and so we know that. We don’t actually understand the tradeoff between—the sense of it is, would you—if you raise interest rates and thereby tighten financial conditions and reduce economic activity now in order to address asset bubbles and things like that, what—will that even help? Will it—will it actually cause more damage, or will it help? So I think that’s unresolved. And I, I think it’s, it’s something we, we look at as not, not theoretically ruled out but not something we, we—we’ve ever done and not something we would plan to do. We would rely on macroprudential and other tools to deal with financial stability issues.","Q&A","Press Conf","","211","2021-01"
"2021-01-27","Yes. So in the statement, on the language, we dropped “in the medium term,” because, really, the risks are, are in the near term, frankly. You know, as I mentioned, it’s the rollout of the vaccine. It’s the arrival of new strains that, that are more contagious and perhaps more virulent. And those are the—those are the—and also just the ongoing—third thing, of course, is the ongoing spread of the virus. It’s, it’s in the near term. It’s not in the medium term. We were thinking—when we were thinking “medium term,” we were thinking of longer-term scarring and things like that. Nonetheless, I mean, I think what—to go to your, your second question, and as I mentioned in my, in my opening remarks—there is good evidence to, to support a stronger economy in the second half of this year. In fact, if you look at, at—as we do—look at a range of private forecasters, what was their forecast in, in December, and what’s their forecast now? Right across the board: much higher forecasts for 2021 growth. And that’s because of the ongoing rollout of the vaccines and also because of fiscal policy, expectations, and the reality of, of the CRRA Act [Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021] getting done. So there is—there is a positive case there. We used an adjective. It was “considerable”—“considerable risks to the economic outlook.” So there are considerable risks, risks to the economic outlook. Nonetheless, that is—that is a more positive outlook. And that’s really how, how I would—I would parse that for you. I don’t know when we’re going to come back to work, and I’m, I’m actually in the Eccles Building here today. And I don’t know when that’ll be. I mean, we—I can’t wait to be working in person again. But, you know, we—we’ve been able to work successfully remotely. We really have. And, you know, we’re not going to push people when they’re uncomfortable. We’re going to wait till people are comfortable and wait till it’s well and truly time to get back together in person.","Q&A","Press Conf","","343","2021-01"

And, and if the kind of emergency conditions arise that are required under that law, then our emergency lending tools will remain available. Now, I’ve had no discussions with anybody at Treasury on that, because I haven’t had any discussions with anybody at Treasury other than meet—you know, high-level meetings with the—with the transition team a month or so ago.

But, you know, the, the strong bulk of the Committee is, is not showing a rate increase during this forecast period. And, you know, as, as data improve, as the outlook improves very significantly since the December meeting, you would expect forecasts to move up. It’s probably not a surprise that some people would bring in their estimate of the appropriate time for liftoff.

And, again, part of that is wanting to see actual data rather than just a forecast at this point. We do expect that we’ll begin to make faster progress on both spending—you know, labor markets and inflation as the year goes on because of the progress with the vaccines, because of the fiscal support that we’re getting.

We never only looked at the unemployment rate, which is the only indicator of, of labor market outcomes that’s in the","Q&A","Press Conf","","49","2021-03"
"2021-03-17","So I guess the first thing to say is that the, the SEP is not a Committee forecast. It’s, it’s not something we sit around and debate and discuss and approve, and say, “This represents our, you know, our reaction function as a Committee.” It’s a compilation of projections from different people. And I—since we don’t debate it or discuss it, it would be hard for me to say why—exactly why each participant did what they were going to do. our estimates of maximum employment—and, as I mentioned, we consider a wide range of indicators in assessing labor market conditions, not just the unemployment rate; inflation that has reached 2 percent, and not just on a transitory basis; and inflation that’s on track to run moderately above 2 percent for some time. The first two of those three are very much data based; the third does have a little bit of a—of an element of expectations in it. So we are very much determined to implement this guidance in a robust way. It is the guidance that we chose carefully to implement our new framework. And to meet these standards, we’ll need to see data, as I mentioned. So what does—what does this, this SEP really say? It says that we’re committed to our framework and to the guidance we’ve provided to implement that framework. We will wait until the requirements set forth in that guidance are clearly met before considering a change in our policy rate. And the last thing I’ll say is this: The state of the economy in two or three years is highly uncertain, and I wouldn’t want to focus too much on the exact timing of a potential rate increase that far into the future. So that’s how I would think about the, the","Q&A","Press Conf","","299","2021-03"
"2021-03-17","I think there’s some of that. Sure, there’ll be some of that. There will still be some social distancing.

And so I think there’ll—there’ll be some of that. happen. You know, it can—it can happen maybe, maybe more quickly than it has in the past, because it involves the reopening of a sector of the economy, as opposed to stimulating aggregate demand and waiting for that to produce job demand for workers. This could be a different sort of a process. And it could be quicker. We don’t know that. But it’s, it’s just a lot of people who have—who need to get back to work. And it’s not going to happen overnight. It would be—it’s going to take some time. No matter how well the economy performs, unemployment will take quite a time to go—to go down, and so will participation. So that’s all I can say. I think the faster the better; we’d love to see it come sooner rather than later. We’d welcome nothing more than that. But, realistically, given the numbers, it’s going to take some time.","Q&A","Press Conf","","210","2021-03"
"2021-03-17","You know, we—the tools we have are the tools we have. What I’m telling you is that the stance of monetary policy we have today, we believe, is appropriate. We think that our asset purchases in their current form—which is to say, you know, across the curve, $80 billion in Treasuries, $40 billion in mortgage-backed securities on net—we think that that’s, that’s the right place for our asset purchases. Now, we can—we can change them, of course, in, in a number of different dimensions should we deem that that’s appropriate. But, for now, we think that our policy stance on that is appropriate. You’ve spoken about the pandemic’s disproportionate toll on Black Americans, Hispanic Americans, Asian Americans, and other groups in the labor market. And I’m curious if you can speak to specific indicators that the Fed will be using to measure job gains for groups that have persistently higher rates of unemployment compared to white Americans. And, relatedly, since you’ve described vaccines as key to the economic recovery, is the Fed concerned about lower vaccination rates in communities of color? And what barriers do you think exist there? Thanks very much.","Q&A","Press Conf","","192","2021-03"
"2021-03-17","So, which measures. So we, we do monitor and communicate very regularly about different labor market—disparities in the labor market, let’s say. So the African American unemployment rate is substantially elevated, and so is the Hispanic unemployment rate. So we look at those and we see those as, you know—it’s, it’s slack in the labor market. It’s, it’s sad to see, because those disparities had really come down to record lows since we started keeping the data that way. As recently as a year ago, February of last year, we had those, those disparities quite low. What happens in a downturn, though, is they move up at twice the speed of white unemployment. So we monitor those things. We—our tools, of course, affect unemployment generally, but we’re going to look at those as, as a form of slack in the labor market and hope that, you know, that there’s progress there. And, and this particular downturn, of course, was just a direct hit on, on a part of the economy that employs many minorities and lower-paid workers. The public-facing workers in the service industries in many cases don’t have a lot of financial assets, they’re not tremendously well paid, they might have other jobs, and things like that. So this was a direct hit on that part of which, which it’s very much doing now. In terms of disparate levels of vaccination, that’s—those are facts and unfortunate facts. They’re really not something we, we have within our policy toolkit to address. But it is—it is true, though, that the data we have suggests that there are—there are significant disparities between different ethnic groups and—you know, but that’s, that’s not for us. That’s for fiscal authorities and the government more generally to, to work on.","Q&A","Press Conf","","294","2021-03"
"2021-03-17","So I do think that fiscal policy overall will have really helped us to avoid much of the scarring that we were very, very concerned about at the beginning. And I think that’s just the size and the speed with which Congress has delivered—you know, with the CARES Act and since then, has—is going to wind up very much accelerating the return to full employment. It’s going to make a huge difference in people’s lives. And it has already. As I mentioned in my remarks—opening remarks, the recovery has been faster than we expected. Part of that just is, it’s very hard to predict, given we’ve never seen an event like this. But part of it is just the strength of the fiscal response, which I think will, will look good over the cases there. And, and I hope we keep at it, and we will keep at it with our policies, of course, to do whatever we can to make sure that’s—that continues. Longer term though, what it takes to drive productive capacity per capita or per hour worked, to raise living standards over time, is investment: investment in people’s skills and aptitudes, investment in plant and equipment, investment in software. It takes a lot of investment to, to support a more productive economy and raise living standards. And that’s—you know, that hasn’t been the principal focus with these measures—our measures, certainly. And we don’t have those tools. But what Congress has been doing has mainly been replacing lost income and beginning to, you know, support people as the economy returns to normal. But there should be a focus on—a longer-term focus, I think, would be healthy on, on the investment front.","Q&A","Press Conf","","283","2021-03"

"2021-03-17","So we haven’t made a decision on that. We’re a couple weeks away from announcing that decision. I, I won’t foreshadow it here today. I will say, we’re going to continue our data-driven approach. You know that we restricted buybacks and dividends, so the firms are preserving capital. Through 2020, the banks actually increased their level of capital quite stringent. We’re right in the middle of our 2021 stress tests, and we’ll release those results before the end of June. And that layers, you know, very significant additional stress on top of the stress the banks have already absorbed over the past year, with the unemployment rate going to 11 percent and stock prices falling more than 50 percent. So—but all of that, you know, the results of the stress tests and the decision on distributions—all of that is to come fairly soon, as I mentioned.","Q&A","Press Conf","","146","2021-03"
"2021-03-17","[Laughter] Not yet. So, as you—as you pointed out, we’ve said that we would continue asset purchases at this pace until we see substantial further progress. And that’s actual progress, not forecast progress. So—and that’s a difference from, from our past approach. So—and what we mean by that is, is pretty straightforward. It is, we want to see that, that the labor markets have moved—labor market conditions have moved—you know, have made substantial progress toward maximum employment, and inflation has made substantial progress toward the 2 percent goal. That’s what we’re going to want to see. Now, that obviously includes an element of judgment. And when we see—we’ll be—we’ll be carefully looking ahead. in that suggests that we’re on track to perhaps achieve substantial further progress, then we’ll say so. And we’ll say so well in advance of any decision to actually taper.","Q&A","Press Conf","","143","2021-03"
"2021-03-17","Well, you know, it all depends. We’ve set out very clear criteria for liftoff, right, where we’ve said we want to see labor market conditions that are consistent with our estimates of, of maximum employment. And that doesn’t just mean unemployment, it means a much broader set of criteria. We want inflation at 2 percent, and not on a transitory basis. And we want inflation on track to be moderately—to run moderately above 2 percent for some time. Those are the three conditions. Everybody on the Committee agrees to that, right? So it comes down to, what’s your projection for the economy? If you want to—if you want to—you know, people will have a range of, of assessments for how good the economy is that uncertainty about the forecast is, is very high compared to the normal level. We haven’t come out of a pandemic before. We haven’t had this kind of fiscal support before, totaling it all up. So you’re going to have different perspectives from Committee participants about how fast growth will be, how fast the labor market will heal, or how fast—sorry, inflation will move up. And those things are going to dictate where people write down an estimate of liftoff. Of course, this isn’t a decision to lift off now. We’ll make that decision then. But it’s an estimate based on—based on assumptions about growth. And it’s, it’s meant to be a tool to generally show the public how, how our objective function works, how we think about the future. It isn’t meant to actually pin down a time when we might or might not lift off. We—you know, we’re not going to make that decision for some time. The chances are that the economy in that time and place will be very different from the one we think it’ll be. So I—sometimes with the dots, I have to be sure to point out that they—they’re not a Committee forecast. And you know this, but it’s—they’re not a Committee forecast. It’s just compiling these projections, really, of individual people. We think it serves a useful purpose. It’s not meant to, to actually be a promise or even a prediction of when the Committee will act. That will be very much dependent on economic outcomes, which are highly uncertain.","Q&A","Press Conf","","382","2021-03"
"2021-03-17","Sure. So, as you know, financial stability for us is, is a framework. It’s not one thing. It’s not a particular market or a particular asset or anything like that. It’s a vulnerabilities: asset valuations, debt owed by businesses and households, funding risk, and leverage among financial institutions. Those four things. And I’ll just quickly touch on them. So if you look at asset valuations, you can say that by some measures, some asset valuations are elevated compared to history. I think that’s clear. In terms of households and businesses, households entered the, the crisis in very good shape by historical standards. Leverage in the household sector had been just kind of gradually moving down and down and down since the—since the financial crisis. Now, there was—there was some negative effects on that, people lost their jobs and that sort of thing, but they’ve also gotten a lot of support now. So the damage hasn’t been as, as bad as we thought. Businesses, by the same token, had a high debt load coming in. And—but—and many saw their revenues decline. But there’s—they’ve done so much financing, and there’s a lot of cash on their balance sheet. So nothing in those two sectors really jumps out as really troubling. Short term—I mentioned funding risk as the—as the last one. So we saw, again, in this crisis, breakdowns in parts of the short-term funding markets—came under a tremendous amount of stress. And they’ve been quiet since the spring. And, you know, we shut down our facilities and all of that. But we, we don’t—we don’t feel like we can let the moment pass without just saying again that we—that those—some aspects of the short-term funding markets and, more broadly, nonbank financial intermediation didn’t hold up so well under great stress—under tremendous stress. And we need to go back and look at that. So a very high priority for us as regulators and supervisors is going to be to go back—and this, this will involve all the other regulatory agencies; it does involve all of them as well—and see if we can strengthen those","Q&A","Press Conf","","351","2021-03"
"2021-03-17","Well, again, I wouldn’t read too much into, into the, the March 2021 SEP dot plot. Remember what it is: It’s a compilation of individual projections by individual members. They’re all making different assessments. They, they have different forecasts, economic forecasts. Some have more optimistic ones, some less optimistic. And they’re—also remember that the SEP doesn’t actually include all the things that go into maximum employment. Right? It’s, it’s only—it only includes unemployment. So I, I would just say, we’ve set out clear guidance. The—the message from the SEP that I would like to leave with people is, we set out clear guidance. I mentioned what it was. It’s inflation up to—no, sorry, it’s, it’s labor market conditions consistent with our estimates of maximum employment—and that’s not just unemployment, it’s all the other indicators, but, overall, totaling up to maximum employment; it’s inflation at 2 percent, and not on a transient basis; and inflation on track to exceed 2 percent for—moderately for some time. Those are the criteria. We’re committed to robustly implementing that guidance. three years is highly uncertain.

"2021-03-17","You’re asking about the relationship between unemployment and inflation? Is that—is that the question?","Q&A","Press Conf","","14","2021-03"
"2021-03-17","Yes, I think I’m hearing you correctly. So I would say a couple things. There was a time when there was a tight connection between unemployment and inflation. That time is long gone. We had extremely low unemployment in, in—not extremely low. We had low unemployment in 2018 and ’19 and the beginning of ’20 without having troubling inflation at all. We were at 3.5 percent. We were bouncing around with unemployment 3.5 percent to 4 percent. And it wasn’t just unemployment. Participation was high, wages were moving up. It was a very healthy thing. And we didn’t see price inflation move up. There is a relationship between wage inflation and unemployment. But that has not— what, what happens is that when wages move up because unemployment is low, companies have been absorbing that increase into their margins rather than raising prices. And that seems to be a feature of late-cycle behavior. So we’re, we’re not—when, when we—when we seek to achieve low unemployment, high levels of employment, which is our mandate, you know, we think we have the freedom to do that based on the data without worrying too much about inflation. understand what you’re saying about the dot plot and, and the message you’re trying to send with the dot plot. But does the same apply for the taper tantrum? You’ve said that it’s going to take “some time” to get some fundamental progress on your goals, but it seems like “some time” could now be any time.","Q&A","Press Conf","","250","2021-03"
"2021-03-17","So we’ve said “substantial further progress.” Now, if you go back, October, November—sorry, November, December, and January, progress in the labor market slowed very sharply. So you had an average of 29,000 jobs per month. If you go back and look at the, the level of job creation before that, it was very, very high—very high. So we weren’t making any progress on the labor market from November through January. February, we saw a nice—a nice pickup, a good jobs report—379,465 private sector. So that’s good. It can go so much higher, though. And, and, you know, it would be nice to see—to really make faster progress that’s different from substantial progress, we’d like to see it be, be higher than that. And I think it will be. That’s—the expectation is, you’ll see now, I think, really strong job creation return—not as high as it was in the very early days of the recovery, the reopening of the economy, but, nonetheless, very strong. Okay. So what, what I’m saying is, to achieve substantial progress from where we are, having had three months of, of very little progress, is going to take some time. And it’s—we don’t want to get into—I don’t want to get into trying to put a pin on the calendar someplace, because it’s going to be data dependent. When we see—when we see ourselves on track to make substantial further progress, we’re going to—we’re going to say so. We understand fully that easing, number three, was—the test was a substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market. Well, what does that mean? Well, it means a substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market. It meant we would communicate when we thought we had that. This is just like that, in a way. What we’re saying is, substantial further progress toward our goals. We’ll tell people when we think—until we—until we say—until we give a signal, you can assume we’re not there yet. And as we approach it, well in advance—well in advance—we will give a signal that, yes, we’re on a path to, to possibly achieve that, to consider tapering. So that’s, that’s how we’re planning to handle it. It’s not different, really, from, from QE3. And I think we’ve learned—what we’ve learned from the experience of these last dozen years is to communicate very carefully, very clearly, well in advance, and then follow through with, with your communications. In this case, it’s, it’s an outcome-based set of guidance, as our rate guidance is, and it’s going to depend on the progress of the economy. That’s why it’s not appropriate to start pointing at dates yet.","Q&A","Press Conf","","442","2021-03"
"2021-03-17","We, you know, we and everyone who’s forecasting these—what, what we’re all doing is, we are looking at the—at the amount of savings. We’re looking at—you be the tendency of people to spend that money, the marginal propensity to consume. And from that, you can develop an estimate of the impact on spending, on growth, on hiring, and, ultimately, on inflation. So that’s, that’s what we’re all doing. And we have, you know, we have—we can look at history, and we can make estimates, and those are all very transparent and public. And you can compare one to the other. And, of course, we’ve all—we’ve all done that. And I think we’ve made very conservative assumptions and sensible mainstream assumptions at each step of that process. And what, what it comes down to is what I said before, which is, there very likely will be a step-up in inflation as March and April of last year drop out of the 12-month window, because they were very low inflation numbers. That’s a—that’ll be a fairly significant pop in inflation. It’ll wear off quickly, though, because it—just the way the numbers are calculated. Past that, as the economy reopens, people will start spending more, and then, you know, you can only go out to dinner once per night, but a lot of people can go out to dinner. And so— and they’re not doing that now. They’re not going to restaurants, not going to theaters. That part of the economy—and travel and hotels—that part of the economy is, is really not functioning at, at full capacity, right? But as that happens, people can start to spend. It’s also—wouldn’t be surprising if—and you’re seeing this now, particularly in the goods economy—there’ll be bottlenecks. They won’t be—they won’t be able to service all of the demand maybe, maybe for a period. So those things could lead to—and we’ve, we’ve modeled that. Other people have too. We’ve—and what we see is relatively modest increases in inflation. So—but those are not permanent things. airlines are, will be flying again, all of those things will happen. And so it’ll turn out to be a one—a one-time sort of bulge in, in prices, but it won’t change inflation going forward, because inflation expectations are strongly anchored around 2 percent. We know that inflation dynamics do evolve over time. And there was a time when, when inflation went up, it would stay up. And, and that time is not now. That hasn’t been the case for some decades. And we think it won’t—it won’t—we won’t suddenly change to another regime. These things tend to change over time. And they tend to—tend to change when the central bank doesn’t understand that having inflation expectations anchored at 2 percent is the key to it all. The, the—having them anchored at 2 percent is what gives us the ability to push hard when the economy’s really weak. If we saw inflation expectations moving materially above 2 percent, of course, we would conduct policy in a way that would, would make sure that that didn’t happen. We’re committed to having inflation expectations anchored at 2 percent, not materially above or below 2 percent. So that’s—I think if you—if you look at the savings, look at all of that, model it, that’s, that’s kind of what comes out of our assessment. There are different possibilities. I think it’s, it’s a relatively unusual—very unusual situation to have all these savings and this, this amount of fiscal support and monetary policy support. Nonetheless, that, that is our most likely case. And you know, as the—as the data come in and the economy performs, we’ll of course adjust. Our outcome-based guidance will immediately adapt, we think, to meet whatever the actual path of the economy is.","Q&A","Press Conf","","629","2021-03"
"2021-03-17","You know, I have to say, I think it’s impossible to say, frankly, with any confidence, but I, I would expect it’s very possible—let’s put it that way—that you will see bottlenecks emerge and then clear over time. And you’ll probably see that over a period of time, because, you know, really, the, the strong data are ahead of us. You know, you’re, you’re—right now the, the checks are going out just, just now. And that’ll, that’ll add to spending. COVID cases are coming down. Vaccination is moving, now, quickly. You know, the, the really strong economic data is coming. It should be coming, assuming we stay on this track. And that’s when you’ll really know where, where the bottlenecks are. But you can see, though, that they’re not—these are not permanent. It’s not like the supply side will be unable to adapt to these things. It will—the market will clear. It just may take some time. And, and some of the answer to that may be price. In many cases, it won’t be price. You’ll see that people are reluctant to raise prices. You know, it’s a little bit the story about, you know, the wage—the wage Phillips curve does show that as unemployment goes down, wages move up. But companies choose not to try to, to pass that, that price increase along to their customers. So you’ll see a lot of that here too, I think. Anyway, we’ll, we’ll see. But that’s, that’s my basic, basic sense. Thank you very much.","Q&A","Press Conf","","253","2021-03"
"2021-03-17","So, Brian, it’s not up to us to decide what, what Congress should spend money on or when. I was answering Jeanna’s question, which really was, how do we assure lack of damage to—scarring, for example, or lack of damage to the productive capacity of the economy? And I think what’s happened so far has done a pretty good job of that. But, really, I wanted to make the longer-run point that if—to work on the productivity—on productivity over longer periods, that is—that is—comes down to a number of things. But one of those things is investment: investment in people, in their skills, education, aptitude, all of those things. I’m not in any way suggesting that that’s something Congress should work on right now. Or that, you know, that’s just not my—that’s not our job. I’m just saying, that, that is what fiscal policy can do that, really, monetary policy can’t do—is, is invest in the future productive capacity of the economy, raise potential growth. Those things are completely tools that Congress has. And, again, I wasn’t making a comment at all on the current fiscal setting.","Q&A","Press Conf","","187","2021-03"

"2021-04-28","So we do monitor the housing market very carefully, of course. And I would say that, before the pandemic, it’s a very different housing market than it was before the Global Financial Crisis. And one of the main differences was that households were in very good no-doc lending practices were not there. So we don’t have that kind of thing where we have a housing bubble where people are overlevered and owning a lot of houses. There’s no question, though, that housing prices are going up, and so we’re watching that carefully. It’s, it’s partly because there’s, there’s clearly strong demand, and there’s just not a lot of supply right now. So builders are, you know, struggling to keep up with the demand, clearly. Inventories are tremendously low. We’re, we’re all hearing those stories. And if you’re—if you’re an entry level housing buyer, this is—this is a problem, because it just is going to be that much harder for people to get that first house, and that’s a problem. I mean, we—it’s part of a strong economy, with people having money to spend and wanting to invest in housing. So, in that sense, it’s good. It’s clearly the strongest housing market that we’ve seen since the Global Financial Crisis. And, you know, my hope would be that, over time, housing builders can react to this demand and, and come up with more supply and workers will come back to work in that industry. So, you know, it is—it’s not an unalloyed good to have prices going up this much, and we’re watching it very carefully. I don’t see the kind of financial stability current concerns, though, that really do reside around the housing sector. So many of the financial crackups in all countries, all western countries, that have happened in the last 30 years have been around housing. We don’t—we really don’t see that here. We don’t see bad loans and unsustainable prices and that kind of thing.","Q&A","Press Conf","","328","2021-04"
"2021-04-28","Good afternoon. At the Federal Reserve, we are strongly committed to achieving the monetary policy goals that Congress has given us: maximum employment and price stability. Today my colleagues on the FOMC and I kept interest rates near zero and maintained our sizable asset purchases. These measures, along with our strong guidance on interest rates and on our balance sheet, will ensure that monetary policy will continue to deliver powerful support to the economy until the recovery is complete. Widespread vaccinations, along with unprecedented fiscal policy actions, are also providing strong support to the recovery. Since the beginning of the year, indicators of economic activity and employment have strengthened. Household spending on goods has risen robustly. The housing sector has more than fully recovered from the downturn, while business investment and manufacturing production have also increased. Spending on services has also picked up, including at restaurants and bars. More generally, the sectors of the economy most adversely affected by the pandemic remain weak but have shown improvement. While the recovery has progressed more quickly than generally expected, it remains uneven and far from complete. The path of the economy continues to depend significantly on the course of the virus and the measures undertaken to control its spread. Since March, progress on vaccinations has limited the number of new cases, hospitalizations, and deaths. While the level of new cases remains concerning, especially as it reflects the spread of more infectious strains of the virus, continued vaccinations should allow for a return to more normal economic conditions later this year. In the As with overall economic activity, conditions in the labor market have continued to improve. Employment rose 916,000 in March, as the leisure and hospitality sector posted a notable gain for the second consecutive month. Nonetheless, employment in this sector is still more than 3 million below its level at the onset of the pandemic. For the economy as a whole, payroll employment is 8.4 million below its pre-pandemic level. The unemployment rate remained elevated at 6 percent in March, and this figure understates the shortfall in employment, particularly as participation in the labor market remains notably below pre-pandemic levels. The economic downturn has not fallen equally on all Americans, and those least able to shoulder the burden have been the hardest hit. In particular, the high level of joblessness has been especially severe for lower-wage workers in the service sector and for African Americans and Hispanics. The economic dislocation has upended many lives and created great uncertainty about the future. Readings on inflation have increased and are likely to rise somewhat further before moderating. In the near term, 12-month measures of PCE inflation are expected to move above 2 percent as the very low readings from early in the pandemic fall out of the calculation and past increases in oil prices pass through to consumer energy prices. Beyond these effects, we are also likely to see upward pressure on prices from the rebound in spending as the economy continues to reopen, particularly if supply bottlenecks limit how quickly production can respond in the near term. However, these one-time increases in prices are likely to have only transitory effects on inflation. promote the stability of the financial system. As we say in our Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, we view maximum employment as a broad-based and inclusive goal. Our ability to achieve maximum employment in the years ahead depends importantly on having longer-term inflation expectations well anchored at 2 percent. As the Committee reiterated in today’s policy statement, with inflation running persistently below 2 percent, we will aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time so that inflation averages 2 percent over time and longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2 percent. We expect to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until these employment and inflation outcomes are achieved. With regard to interest rates, we continue to expect it will be appropriate to maintain the current 0 to ¼ percent target range for the federal funds rate until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee’s assessment of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time. I would note that a transitory rise in inflation above 2 percent this year would not meet this standard. In addition, we will continue to increase our holdings of Treasury securities by at least $80 billion per month and of agency mortgage-backed securities by at least $40 billion per month until substantial further progress has been made toward our maximum-employment and price-stability goals. The increase in our balance sheet since March 2020 has materially eased financial conditions and is providing substantial support to the economy. The economy is a long way from our goals, and it is likely to take some time for substantial further progress to be achieved. guidance will ensure that the stance of monetary policy remains highly accommodative as the recovery progresses. To conclude, we understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission. We at the Fed will do everything we can to support the economy for as long as it takes to complete the recovery. Thank you.","Opening Statement","Press Conf","","883","2021-04"
"2021-04-28","Thank you. So, no, it is not time yet. We’ve said that we would let the public know when it is time to have that conversation, and we said we’d do that well in advance of any actual decision to taper our asset purchases, and we will do so. In the meantime, we’ll be monitoring progress toward our goals. We first articulated this “substantial further progress” test at our December meeting. Economic activity and hiring have just recently picked up after slowing over the winter. And it will take some time before we see substantial further progress.","Q&A","Press Conf","","97","2021-04"
"2021-04-28","Yes, so we have to leave questions about herd immunity and what that looks like to the health experts, but, but I would certainly say that what matters the most to the economic recovery continues to be controlling the virus. The economy can’t fully recover until people are confident that it’s safe to resume activities involving crowds of people. There may be people who are around the edges of the labor force who won’t come back in unless they feel really comfortable going back to their old jobs, for example, and there, there may be parts of the economy that will—that just won’t be able to, to really fully reengage until the pandemic is decisively behind us. But, you know, we’ve articulated particular guidance for tapering our asset purchases and for lifting off and raising interest rates. So for, for asset purchases, we’ve said that we would continue at the current pace of asset purchases until we see substantial further progress toward our goals. So—and that is, that is what it is, substantial further progress. For interest rates, as I—as I said a moment ago, we want to see labor market conditions consistent with maximum employment, we want to see inflation at 2 percent, and we want to see it on track to exceed 2 percent. So those are our tests. We don’t have an independent test to do with the virus. I will say, though, as I—as I started with, you know, the, the path of the virus is going to have an effect on our ability to achieve both of those tests.","Q&A","Press Conf","","264","2021-04"
"2021-04-28","Right. So it seems unlikely, frankly, that we would see inflation moving up in a persistent way that would actually move inflation expectations up while there was still significant slack in the labor market. I won’t say that it’s impossible, but it, it seems—it seems unlikely. It’s much more likely that we would—having achieved maximum-employment conditions—we’d also be seeing 2 percent inflation and be on track to see inflation moving above 2 percent. They tend to move together. So that’s not to say inflation won’t—might not move up, but for inflation to move up in a persistent way that, that really starts to move inflation expectations up, that would have to—that would take some time. And you would think that, that it would be quite likely that, that we’d be in very strong labor markets for that to be happening. If it—if that actually were to happen, though, there is a—there’s a paragraph in the—in the Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy which says that when the two goals are somewhat in conflict, we weigh various factors, including the, the time it would take to get back and [so] forth. So we do—it doesn’t really tell you what to do, but it tells you that we will weigh those two factors and how far we are away from them and how long it would take to reach them were we to reach that sort of pretty unlikely state. question, and I wonder if you can help us understand better your thinking about how COVID infection rates and the virus calibrate with monetary policy. As you recall, we had a major resurgence in the virus last fall. And I’m wondering, would you need to be assured that there wasn’t such a resurgence coming before you began—I mean, for lack of a better term—thinking about thinking about tapering? And what kind of comfort level would you need? Would it be something that would be declared from the CDC or the, or the World Health Organization—for example, downgrading the virus from a pandemic—before you have the comfort level to reverse course on policy? Thank you.","Q&A","Press Conf","","354","2021-04"
"2021-04-28","Yes. We, we really have—just articulated the goals that I’ve—that I’ve just mentioned a couple of times, which is substantial further progress toward our goals before we taper. Now, that’s very likely—for us to achieve that, it’s very likely going to be the case that we’ve also made really significant progress on controlling the virus through vaccination and, and other—it, it—you know, those two things should more or less coexist. We haven’t articulated a separate test for a state of the virus that we’d like to achieve because we’re not—you know, we’re not experts in that area. We’re, we’re really focused on the economic outcomes, and, again, my, my guess is that we—it’s very likely, it seems to me, that for us to achieve the economic outcomes, we would need to taper or to raise interest rates. We would also have to have made very substantial progress in getting the virus under control—not, not necessarily fully under control. There is a, a possibility, of course, that we will, will have ongoing outbreaks over the summer and various regional outbreaks and potentially next winter","Q&A","Press Conf","","183","2021-04"
"2021-04-28","So I would say that we were very worried about scarring, both in the labor market from people being out of—out of the labor market for an extended period of time. The evidence is clear that it becomes much more difficult if you’re out for a long time to get back in and get back to the life that you had. Same thing with these small businesses, many of which are the work of generations. Were we going to wipe out many of those unnecessarily? That was a big concern. I would say that, so far, you know, here we are in late April of 2021. We haven’t experienced that level of scarring either in the labor market or among smaller businesses. So we’re not living that, that downside case that we were very concerned about a year ago. Notwithstanding that, we’re a long way from full employment. We’re—you know, payroll jobs are 8.4 million below where they were in February of 2020. We’ve got a long ways to go. And also, it’s going to be a different economy. industries that have been employing a lot of people. You know, it, it may well be—it seems quite likely that a number of the people who, who had those service-sector jobs will struggle to find the same job and may need time to find work and get back to the working life they had. These were people who were working in February of 2020. They clearly want to work. So those people are going to need—they’re going to need help. And so, while I would say we haven’t seen really highly elevated levels of unemployment for—you know, up in the teens that we thought we might have for an extended period of time, we’ve still got a lot of people who are out to—out of work. We want to get them back to work as quickly as possible, and that’s really one of the things we’re trying to achieve with our policy.","Q&A","Press Conf","","331","2021-04"
"2021-04-28","Chris, you were breaking up a little there, but I think I did get your question. So I think there are a number of—a number of things going on there: the tension between a high level of unemployment and yet many, many companies saying they can’t find— an elevated number of companies saying that they can’t find workers. So, what’s really going on there? It, it should be a number of different things. There are workers who don’t actually have the specific skills that the employers are looking for. There may be geographical differences. It, it may also be that, for example, there—one big factor would be, schools aren’t open yet, so there are still people who are at home taking care of their children and would like to be back in the workforce but can’t be yet. There are people afraid of—there are virus fears that are weighing on people, so some—some people don’t want to go back to work. There are also a significant number of people who say they’ve retired—a large number of people that say that they’re retired. Now, it’s hard to say whether they will come back in as the labor market strengthens and as COVID, you know, becomes a—in the rearview mirror, in the history books, if you will. So—but clearly there’s something going, going on out there, as, as many companies are reporting labor shortages. We don’t see wages moving up yet, and presumably we would see expansion, we don’t know, but, but what we saw was that labor supply generally showed up. In other words, if you were worried about there—about running out of workers, it seemed like we never did. You know, labor force participation held up. People came in the labor force. They stayed in the labor force longer than expected. So my guess would be that you will see people coming back into the labor force, and these jobs will be—the labor market will reach equilibrium. Maybe pay will go up. But I do think that—and I do think also that unemployment insurance benefits will run out in September, so to the extent that’s a factor, which is not clear, it will no longer be a factor fairly soon. So my guess is, it will come back to this economy where we have, you know, equilibrium between labor supply and labor demand. It may take some months, though.","Q&A","Press Conf","","399","2021-04"
"2021-04-28","Thanks for your question. So I actually have a couple things I’d like to say about inflation, including addressing your question. So let me start with just saying that we’re very strongly committed to achieving our objectives of maximum employment and price stability. Our, our price stability goal is 2 percent inflation over the longer run, and we believe that having inflation average 2 percent over time will help anchor long-term inflation expectations at 2 percent. With inflation having run persistently below 2 percent for some time, the Committee seeks inflation moderately above inflation for two times—above 2 percent for some time. So, with a, a little bit of context, we’re, we’re making our way through an unprecedented series of events, really, in which a synchronized global shutdown is now giving way to widespread reopening of economies in many places around the world. In the United States, fiscal and monetary policy continue to provide strong support: Vaccinations are now widespread, and the economy is beginning to move ahead with real momentum. During this time of reopening, we are likely to see some upward pressure on prices, and I’ll discuss why. But those pressures are likely to be temporary as they are associated with the reopening process. In an episode of one-time price increases as the economy reopens is not the same thing as, and is not likely to lead to, persistently higher year-over-year inflation into the future— inflation at levels that are not consistent with our goal of 2 percent inflation over time. Indeed, it is the Fed’s job to make sure that that does not happen. If, if, contrary to expectations, inflation were to move persistently and materially above 2 percent in a manner that threatened to move longer-term inflation expectations materially above 2 percent, we would use our tools to bring ’70s, of course. And we know that our job is to achieve 2 percent inflation over time. We’re committed to that, and we will use our tools to do that. So that’s a very different situation than you had back in the 1960s—or many, many differences, actually. So let me talk quickly about the two reasons—two, or you could say three, but really two main reasons why we think inflation will move up in the near term. The first is the base effects. Twelve-month measures of inflation are likely to move well above 2 percent over the next few months as the very low inflation readings recorded in March and April of last year drop out of the calculation. That process has already started to show up. You saw it in the March CPI reading, and you’ll see it later this week in the PCE price data. These base effects will contribute about 1 percentage point to headline inflation and about 0.7 percentage point to core inflation in April and May. So, significant increases, and they’ll disappear over the following months. And they’ll be transitory. They carry no implication for the rate of inflation in later periods. So that’s base effects. The other big one I would talk about is bottlenecks. So this is what we’re seeing in supply chains in various industries, and we’re, we’re in close touch with all of these industries. You know, the Fed has a network of contacts that is unequaled in businesses and in nonprofits for that matter, too. So what do we mean by a bottleneck? A bottleneck really is a temporary blockage or restriction in the supply chain for, for a particular good or goods, something that slows down the process of producing goods and delivering them to the market. We think of bottlenecks as things that, in their nature, will be resolved as workers and businesses adapt, and we think of them as not calling for a change in monetary policy since they’re temporary and bottlenecks, or for that matter, the temporary effects that they will have on prices in the meantime. So, you know, I’ll just sum up and say, we understand our job. We will do our job. And we are, we are focused—as you’ve seen, for many years, we’ve been focused on inflation deviating below 2 percent, and we used our tools aggressively to keep it back up at 2 percent. If, if we see inflation moving materially above 2 percent in a persistent way that risks inflation expectations drifting up, then we will use our tools to guide inflation and expectations back down to 2 percent. No one should doubt that we will do that. This is not what we expect. But no one should doubt that, in the event, we would be prepared to use our tools.","Q&A","Press Conf","","774","2021-04"
"2021-04-28","So, what is “a string”? What do I mean by “a string”? Well, I would say, what we have right now is one really good—I can tell you what it’s not. It’s not one really good employment reading, which is what we got in March. We got close to a million jobs in March and a very strong labor market reading. And I was just suggesting that we’d want to see So we have—we’re a long way from our, our goals. And we don’t have to get all the way to our goals to taper asset purchases, we just need to make substantial further progress. It’s going to take some time. On, on “largely,” there are a bunch of factors. I was really thinking—we were thinking of the base effects and also the energy effects. I wasn’t meaning to say there are some real effects.

"2021-04-28","We’re, we, we supervise banks to make sure that they have risk- management systems in place so that they can spot these things. We don’t manage their companies for them or, or try to manage individual risks. In the grand scheme of these large What was troubling, though, was that this could happen in a business for a number of firms that is thought to be—to carry relatively well understood risks. The prime brokerage business is, is a well understood business, and so it was surprising that a number of them would have had this. And it was essentially, I believe, the fact that, that they had the same big risk position on with a number of firms, and they weren’t—some of the firms were not aware that there were other firms that had those things. I, I wouldn’t say it’s in any way an indictment of our supervision of these firms. It, it—in some cases, it may be they were—it seems as though there were risk-management breakdowns at some of the firms, not all of them. And that’s what we’re looking into.","Q&A","Press Conf","","183","2021-04"
"2021-04-28","Right. Inflation expectations before the pandemic hit—and here we think of survey, market based—survey being either households or, or economists and, and market based. You look at all of those, and I would say that they were at the low end of what would have been consistent with a 2 percent inflation target, particularly our 2 percent inflation target, which calls for 2 percent average inflation. So they’re at the low end. Inflation expectations actually went down a bit at the beginning of the pandemic, and now they’ve just moved back up to levels broadly—that, that are where they were in 2018, or in some cases 2014, and, I would say, more consistent with our mandate. And we want them to be—we want them to be higher and—you know, on a persistent basis. We want inflation to run a little bit higher than it has been running for the last quarter of a century. We want it to average 2 percent, not 1.7 percent. And for that, we need to see inflation expectations that are consistent with that, really well anchored at 2 percent. We don’t really see that yet, but I would say that, that, you know, breakevens have moved up, in a way. Breakevens very carefully, as you would obviously know. So that’s where—that’s where I would say it is.","Q&A","Press Conf","","222","2021-04"
"2021-04-28","It doesn’t work that way. You know, we’re, we’re—inflation measures are always going to be a bit volatile. We expect—as I mentioned, we expect core and, and headline PCE to move up because of base effects, and—you know, I—and we expect that to go away. We, we also expect these, these bottleneck effects to come in. We don’t know how persistent they’ll be. We, we think they’ll—you know, it’s a matter of, of when they will pass through, not whether they will pass through. But we can’t be confident about the exact timing of that or the size of them. They don’t seem especially large at the moment, but, you know, we, we don’t know. I mean, you know, this is—this is all about the reopening of the economy. That’s what’s happening. We had it—we were in a deep, deep hole a year ago, and now, with a lot of help from fiscal policy, some additional help from monetary policy, and, you know, a great deal of help from vaccination, we’re seeing a strong rebound in activity. And what’s happening is, it’s, it’s—demand can be spurred with fiscal transfers and—the saved-up fiscal transfers and, and people going back to work and things like that. The supply side will take a little bit of time to adapt. New restaurants will have to be opened. The supply of various inputs into the goods part of the economy will have to be brought back up to speed. And you—you’re seeing some of that.","Q&A","Press Conf","","250","2021-04"
"2021-04-28","Right. So we look at—financial stability for us is really—we have a broad framework, so we don’t just jump from one thing to another. I know many people just look at asset prices, and they look at some of the things that are going on in the—in the equity markets, which, which I think do reflect froth in the equity markets. But really, it—really, we try to stick to a framework for financial stability so we can—so we can talk about it the same way each time and so we can be held accountable for it. So one of the areas is asset prices, and I would say some of the asset prices are high. You are seeing, seeing things in the capital markets that, that are—that are a bit frothy. That’s a fact. I won’t say it has nothing to do with monetary policy, but it also—it has a tremendous amount to do with vaccination and reopening of the economy. That’s really what has been moving markets a lot in the last few months is this turn away from what was a pretty dark winter to now a fast—a much faster vaccination process and a faster reopening. So that’s, that’s part of what’s going on. Leverage in the financial system is, is not an issue; we have very well capitalized large banks. We have funding risks for, for our largest financial institutions that are also very low. We do have some funding risk issues around money market funds, but I would say they’re not systemic right now. And, and the household sector is actually in pretty good shape. It was in—it was in a very good shape as a relative matter before the financial crisis—sorry, the pandemic crisis hit. There were real concerns, of course, with high levels of unemployment and loss of wages and all of that, that the—that the household sector would, would, would weaken dramatically. That hasn’t happened. So, with the fiscal transfers, money that’s on household balance sheets, they’re in good shape. You see relatively low defaults and that kind of thing. So the overall financial stability picture is mixed, but, on balance, it’s—you know, it’s manageable, I would say. And it’s—by the way, I think it’s appropriate and important for financial conditions to remain accommodative to support economic activity. Again, 8½ million people who had jobs in February don’t have them now, and, you know, there’s a long way to go until we reach our goal. So that’s what I would say.","Q&A","Press Conf","","418","2021-04"
"2021-04-28","Right. So the federal funds rate has been well within target and—at target range, and money market funds—money market conditions are, are fine. We have the ability to use our administrative tools to make sure that that remains the case. We do expect to, to support rates. And, of course, we will do so if, if the need does arise.","Q&A","Press Conf","","60","2021-04"
"2021-04-28","So I think capital requirements for banks are, to me—went up tremendously, really, over the course of the 10 years between the financial crisis and the arrival of the pandemic. And the banks really made it through a real stress test very well and passed three, three of our—two of our stress tests, and that is another one that’s pending. So capital is, is in a good place, as far as I’m concerned, in the banking system. But, to your point, what we saw was—so what, what kind of happened during the pandemic crisis that, that requires attention, and number one is money market funds and corporate bond funds where we saw run dynamics again, and we need to—we’re, we’re looking at that. So we’re looking at ways, and people around the world are looking at ways, to make those vehicles resilient so that they don’t have to be, you know, supported by the government whenever there’s, you know, severely stressed market conditions.

"2021-04-28","Okay. Sorry. So we have—you know, we’ve articulated our test for that, as you know, and that is just, we’ll continue asset purchases at this pace until we see substantial further progress. And we’re, we’re going to communicate well in advance of any decision. We’re going to let, you know, the, the public know that that’s what we’re thinking. And, and so there’ll be a lot of warning and that kind of thing. But it’s about substantial further progress toward our goals. That’s, that’s really all it is. It doesn’t have any, any external, virus- related specific requirement, although, again, I do think it’ll—you know, the, the virus will need to continue to be controlled for us to achieve those economic goals.

"2021-04-28","Yes. I, I mean, we’re—we started buying MBS because the mortgage-backed security market was, was really experiencing severe dysfunction, and we’ve sort of, sort of articulated, you know, what our exit path is from that. It’s not meant to provide direct assistance to, to the housing market. That was never the intent. It was really just to keep that as—it’s a very close relation to the Treasury market and a very important market on its own. And so that’s, that’s why we, we bought as we did during the Global Financial Crisis; we bought MBS too. Again, not, not an intention to send help to the housing market, which was, which was really not, not a problem this time at all. So—and, you know, it’s, it’s a situation where we will, we will taper asset purchases when the time comes to do that, and those, those purchases will come to zero over time. And that time is not yet.","Q&A","Press Conf","","159","2021-04"
"2021-04-28","So it’s really not more complicated than this. We, we articulated the “substantial further progress” test at our December meeting. And, really, for the next couple of months, we made relatively little progress toward our goals. And, remember, substantial further progress from December—from our December meeting. And then vaccination started to get more widespread. The economy reopened. We got a really nice job report for March. It doesn’t constitute substantial further progress. It’s not close to substantial further progress. We’re hopeful that we will see along this path a way to that goal. And we believe we will; it just is a question of when. And so, when that time—when the time comes for us to talk about talking about it, we’ll do that. And—but that time is not now. It’s—we’re just not—we’re not that far. We’ve had one great jobs report. It’s not enough. You know, we’re going to act on actual data, not on our forecast. And we’re just going to need to see more data.

I mean, I think the effect is proportional to the amount we buy. It’s, it’s really part of overall accommodative financial conditions. We, we have tried to create accommodative financial conditions to support economic activity, and we did that. And we articulated the—you know, the, the tests for withdrawing that accommodation. And we think, you know—so we’re waiting to see those tests to be fulfilled both for asset purchases and for liftoff of rates. And, you know, when the tests are fulfilled, we’ll, we’ll go ahead. As we—you know, we’ve done this before. We did it in, in the last—after the last crisis, and, you know, we’ll do it in, in maybe—we’ll do it—as those tests are satisfied, we’ll do it. And the—and the only thing that will guide us is, are the tests met? You know, that, that’s what we focused on: Is—have, have the macroeconomic conditions that we’ve articulated, have they been realized?

"2021-04-28","Right. So I think the first thing to say is that we feel an obligation to understand the technology and all of the policy issues very, very well. Central bank digital currencies are now possible, and we’re going to see some of them around the world. And we need to understand whether that’s something that would be a good thing for the people that we serve. How would it work in our system? And there are some very, very difficult questions to answer, but I think we—and we are engaged in a serious program to understand both the technology and the policy issues. because of our rule of law; our democratic institutions, which are the best in the world; our economy; our industrious people; all the things that make the United States the United States. That’s why we’re the, the reserve currency. And, of course, we have open capital accounts, which is essential if you’re going to be the reserve currency. So those are the factors that make us the reserve currency. I am—I’m less concerned that someone—that another country might have a digital currency first. You know, ask yourself the question, does that mean that, if you were a company that’s doing international business, would you then suddenly start to use that currency to use your—do your international transactions, or would you still do them in dollars, where, where— which is what everyone does? And I’m not so concerned about, about that. I am really concerned about getting it right. It is—it is a—it is a tricky set of questions that we have to navigate in a world where we already have, remember, a highly evolved payment system. We have FedNow and other immediately available funds. Pretty soon everybody will be able to, to do what people do in other parts of the world, which is just use their phone to make immediately available payments all the time. It’ll be normal. And what would be the role of a central bank digital currency in that kind of an environment? Far more important to get it right than it is to do it fast or feel that we need to rush to reach conclusions because other countries are moving ahead. I mean, that—what the China—the currency that’s being used in China is not one that would—that would work here.

"2021-06-16","So we, we do tend to look at the longer-term inflation expectations, because that’s really, we think, what matters for, for inflation. So and, and, you know, the shorter-term ones do tend to move around based on, for example, gasoline prices. So you’ll see if gasoline prices were to spike, you’ll see the shorter-term inflation expectation measures, particularly the surveys, move up. And, and that’s, that’s maybe not a good signal for future inflation if, if gas happens to spike and then go back down again. know, sort of further exacerbating concerns that we might find ourselves where, for example, the ECB and the Bank of Japan have been, where you have expectations and inflation itself sliding down and you have a really hard time stopping that process once it begins. So that was a concern. So it’s, it’s good, actually, to see inflation—longer-term inflation expectations move back up to a range—it’s a range that’s consistent with what our objectives are. These are not precise measures, and that’s—and they, they contain risk premiums of various kinds. And that’s why we look at a broad range of them and tend to look at the movement of that broad range of, of, of indicators, which are from, you know, surveys of economists, surveys of the public, and also market based. It’s, it’s, it’s a wide index, as I’m sure you know. We look at that, and we see them back in the range where they were. And, by the way, they’ve been broadly higher than that, somewhat modestly higher than that, not so many years ago, at a time when inflation was, was, was still anchored at around 2 percent or maybe even a little bit below. So the answer is, yes, I think they are anchored and they’re at a good place right now. It’s gratifying to see them having moved up off of their pandemic lows. And, you know, as you know, it’s, it’s fundamental in our framework, our new framework, to, to assure that inflation—longer-term inflation expectations are anchored at a place that is consistent with our goal. We, we think that’s an important reason. If, if inflation expectations are not anchored at a place that’s consistent with your goal, it’s not clear why you would expect to hit your goal over the longer term. So it’s important.","Q&A","Press Conf","","389","2021-06"

And I now suggest that we retire that term, which has—which has served its purpose well, I substantial further progress. Participants expect continued progress ahead toward that objective. And assuming that is the case, it will be appropriate to consider announcing a plan for reducing our asset purchases at a future meeting. So at coming meetings, the Committee will continue to assess the economy’s progress toward our goals, and we’ll give advance notice before announcing any decision.

"2021-06-16","So that’s a—that’s a few questions there. So let me say, first, I think people misinterpret the framework. I think the—there’s nothing wrong with the framework, and there’s nothing in the framework that would in any way, you know, interfere with our ability to pursue our, our goals. That’s for starters. All of our discussions and all of our thinking and planning are taking place in the context of our new framework. We’re strongly committed to it, we think it’s well suited to our goals, including in this—in this unique time. And I think if you look at the—look at the forecasts that we’ve written down, you know, our Committee is solidly behind them. The forecasts are all consistent with that. You know, your specific question, I guess, was, will we be behind the curve? And, you know, that’s, that’s not the situation we’re facing at all. The situation that we, we addressed in wouldn’t raise interest rates just because unemployment was low and employment was high if there was no evidence of inflation or other troubling imbalances. So that’s what we said. That is not at all the current situation. In the current situation, we have many millions of people who are unemployed, and we have inflation running well above our target. The question we face with this inflation has nothing to do with our framework. It’s a very different, very difficult version of a standard investment—sorry, a central banking question. And that is, how do you separate in inflation—how do you separate things that, that follow from broad upward price pressures from things that really are a function of, of sort of idiosyncratic factors in a particular—due to particular things? I mean, a classic example was, to pick a narrow example, was the cellphone price war back in 2017. If you remember, there was—prices were incredibly low, and it held down core PCE by three-tenths or something for a year, and then it fell out. So this is much bigger than that. And, of course, it’s not—it’s not easy to tell in real time which is which, but that’s, that’s the question you would face under, really, any framework. And, you know, we’re trying to sort that out. I’ve tried to, to explain that today about how we think about that. And, you know, we do think that these are temporary factors, and that they’ll wane. We can’t be absolutely certain about the timing of that, and we’re prepared to use our tools as appropriate. Your second one was? Oh, you know, we will—we will taper when we feel that the economy has achieved substantial further progress. And we will communicate very carefully in advance on that. And that’s what we’re doing. That’s what we’re going to do, and, and we will follow through on that. There’s no—I mean, we will do what we can to avoid a market reaction. The third thing was—what was the third thing?","Q&A","Press Conf","","490","2021-06"
"2021-06-16","A higher neutral rate would mean that interest rates would run higher by that amount. And, and that would be a good thing from the standpoint of the economy, because it would give the Fed more room to cut rates. The problem with, with interest rates being close to the lower bound, of course, is that it really cuts into our ability to react to a downturn—for example, a pandemic. And if you look, for example, at the European Central Bank, their, their policy rate was well below zero when, when the pandemic hit. So we don’t want to be in a place where we can’t react. A higher neutral rate would, would be—from that narrow standpoint, would be a good thing for us. It would give us more room and, therefore, then, that would tend to result in better outcomes for the economy over time. You know, we, it’s—you can’t estimate it with great—with great precision. I think we would be alert to—I mean, studying r* is a—is a whole industry unto itself. And I, I think we would be alert to factors that might raise r*, the neutral rate of interest. And, you know, we, we try to keep up with that. And I think we’re, we’re, we’re all thinking about that and the possibility of that. You know, there are many—there are a lot of stories right now that could—that essentially could lead to higher productivity growth and higher r*. We don’t know which of those stories will come true. But, I mean, I’ll give you an example. It’s just there are—there are a lot of start-ups, a lot of early-stage companies. And is that going to have that effect? We don’t know. But we’ll be watching those things carefully.","Q&A","Press Conf","","293","2021-06"
"2021-06-16","We’re looking at an economy that will not have the degree of, of fiscal support. The fiscal support in the forecast is much less than it was this year. So—but you’ve, you’ve still got a very strong growth, well above the longer-run potential output of the— of the economy. You’ve got—you’ve got growth meaningfully above that, and inflation is lower next year in all of our—in all of our forecasts. I think the range of, of core PCE forecast for next year is 1.7 to 2.5 in 2022 and, and 2 to 2.3 in 2023. So you’re right, you’re seeing—I, I can’t remember the number, but it might be in the 3s—3, 3½ percent growth for next year. That’s, that’s a really good year—coming on the back of a 7 percent growth year, that’s a really good year. That’s, that’s a year with a lot of momentum. That’ll see—you know, that’ll cause significant job creation and, and it will—I mean, we would take 3½ percent. We didn’t have a 3½ percent growth year—we didn’t have a 3 percent growth year between the Global Financial Crisis and the end of the expansion. So that would be a good year.","Q&A","Press Conf","","198","2021-06"
"2021-06-16","Yeah, I think—there may be an element of the latter as well, because inflation expectations have continued to move up. You know, it’s all in people’s individual thinking, and you can’t—it’s hard to say. It’s not something the Committee debates in terms of, you know, what, what the outlook is for 2023. So I’m, I’m a little bit speculating, which I shouldn’t do. But it wouldn’t surprise me if there’s an element for some people in, you know, seeing the inflation performance that we’ve had and thinking that I have more confidence that we could see inflation above 2 percent, that it may not be as hard to do that as we thought, and that inflation expectations may move up to a—to a level—they were—they were really at a level that was kind of a little below 2 percent. They might move up as a consequence of this or, or, or as a consequence of, of, of the new framework. You know, we did see inflation expectations moving","Q&A","Press Conf","","168","2021-06"
"2021-06-16","So what we’re seeing in the near term—again, our base case is that what we’re seeing in the near term is, is principally associated with, with the reopening of the sides of the economy adapt. We have a very highly adaptive, you know, flexible economy, more so than most. And by 2023, those increases are really about, about, you know, rising resource utilization or, to put it a different way, you know, low unemployment, or high employment is a way to think about it. So that’s what that’s about. That’s about the kind of broad inflationary pressure that results from, you know, a really strong expansion tightening up resource utilization across the whole economy and lifting, lifting up inflation. And that’s why—that’s why you would see it then, because by then, you know, in the forecast—and it’s just a forecast, they’re just individual forecasts. In people’s forecasts, that’s what’s happening.","Q&A","Press Conf","","150","2021-06"
"2021-06-16","You know, it’s a—it’s a continuum, right? What you’ve seen with the pandemic is sharply declining cases, hospitalizations, and deaths. And that’s great. And, and, you know, that should continue. But, you know, you, you also saw in the United Kingdom, which has, I think, at least as high if not higher vaccination rates, they’ve had an outbreak of the Delta variety. And it’s—and it’s causing them to have to—to have to react to that. So you’re not—you’re not out of the woods at this point. And it would be premature to—in my thinking, it would be premature to declare victory. Vaccination still has a ways to go to get to levels—it would be good to see it get to a substantially higher level. And, you know, that can only help. So, look, I—but you’re right, the statement language is evolving. I would expect it to continue to evolve. There’s a lot of judgment in that. But you can expect us to drag our feet a little bit on that, because that’s what you do with statement language. It’s, it’s great to see the progress. But, again, I would not declare victory yet. I would say it is so great to see the reopening of the economy, though, and to see people out living their lives again. You know, who doesn’t want to see that? And it appears to be safe, and I just would encourage people to continue to get vaccinated.","Q&A","Press Conf","","242","2021-06"
"2021-06-16","Well, that is really not the problem we’re having right now. But— and, actually, people who work in commodity industries are very focused on that, because they know that, you know, they don’t want to build, build capacity and then find out that it’s not necessary. So, really, the problem now is, is that demand is very, very strong. Incomes are high, people have money in their bank accounts. Demand for goods is extremely high, and it hasn’t— it hasn’t come down. We’re seeing the service sector reopening. And so you’re seeing prices are moving back up off their lows there. But in terms of, of overcorrecting, I mean, I think there, there is a possibility on the other side of this that, that inflation could be—could actually be quite low going forward. But that’s not—that’s not really where our focus is right now. Our focus right now is, we need to—our, our expectation is that these, these high inflation readings that we’re seeing now will start to abate. And that’s, that’s what we think. And it’ll be like the lumber experience, and like we expect the used car experience to be. With things like airplane tickets and hotels, which are the other two factors in the most recent CPI report that went up a lot, we expect that those prices will get back up to where they were, but there’s no reason to think that they’re going to keep going up happen. I think in terms of the timing and the effects on inflation in the near term, there’s a lot of uncertainty. The overall story is one that, that we think is right, and we think the incoming data support it and, you know, so do many, many forecasters. And if you look at the forecasts on the FOMC, you will—you will see that as well. But we don’t—we don’t in any way dismiss the chance that it can work out that, that this goes on longer than expected. And the risk would be that over time, it does begin to affect inflation expectations. And if we see inflation expectations and inflation—or inflation moving up in a way that is really materially above what we—what we would see as consistent with our goals, and persistently so, we wouldn’t hesitate to use our tools to address that. Price stability is half of our mandate, and we would certainly do that. We do not expect that, though. That is not our base case. And, and in that we’re joined by many other forecasters, but there’s a lot to be humble about among forecasters. Forecasters have a lot to be humble about. It’s a—it’s a highly uncertain business. And we’re, we’re very much attuned to the risks and, and watching the data carefully. In the meantime, I would say, you know, we should—as I mentioned earlier, there’s so much uncertainty around this. It’s, it’s just a unique situation that we need to see how things evolve in coming months and, and see how that story holds up and act accordingly.","Q&A","Press Conf","","509","2021-06"
"2021-06-16","What I can say is, we’re working on it. I don’t have anything to share with you in terms of the particulars or the timing right now, unfortunately. But we’ve, we’ve always—our position has been for a long time and, and it is now that we’d, we’d like the leverage ratio to be a backstop to risk-based capital requirements. When leverage requirements are, are, are binding, it does skew incentives for firms to substitute lower-risk assets for high-risk ones. It’s a straightforward thing. And because of the substantial increase in reserves, Treasuries, and other safe assets in the banking system, the SLR is rapidly ceasing to become— ceasing to be the intended backstop for big firms that we want it to be. So we do think it’s appropriate to consider ways to adapt it to this new high-reserves environment, and, and we’re looking hard at the issue. We would also, just to be really clear, we will take whatever actions are necessary to assure that any changes we do make or recommend do not erode the overall strength of bank capital requirements. Sorry, I can’t give you any more. That’s just something we’re working on. price jumps we’ve seen in some raw materials—lumber, for example, you mentioned that earlier—seem to be easing. And it looks like we’re at the beginning of suppliers catching up with demand. But I wonder if you’re worried at all, if we’re going to end up with excess supply immediately after those shortages wear off and if we just continue this mismatch, as we’re recovering and getting out of the pandemic economy. And I wonder how that would affect the Fed’s outlook at all.","Q&A","Press Conf","","278","2021-06"
"2021-06-16","Yeah. As, as you well know, there isn’t one indicator we can look to, and there’s no one number that we can therefore point to. We look at a range of indicators, and it’s a very broad range, you can count to a high number just quickly—but, but, certainly, it will include things like unemployment and participation and wages and many different flavors of that. So how do we think about it? A couple of things. We’re all going to be informed by what we saw in the last cycle, which was labor supply outperforming expectations over a long period of time. Now, that hadn’t happened in many other cycles, but this was a very long cycle. So we’re going to have to be alert to see whether that can happen again. It is a different—it’s a different economy. We, we have had a slew of retirements, and that may weigh on participation. That, that effect, though, should wear off in a few years and, and, you know, as you move through that window, because they would have—people would have retired anyway, and you’ll be back where you, you would have been. So I think we’re—I think that lesson number one is, is just to be careful about assessing maximum employment. And I think if you—during the last cycle, there were—there were waves of concern that we were reaching full employment as early, all going to be informed by that. At the same time, we understand this is a different economy. You know, the, the demographics are, people are getting older, and that should have a secular effect of, of reducing participation over time. So we have to be sensible about what, what can be done. But I think we’re going to be—we’re going to lean into that and be optimistic. You asked about wages. You know, we’re seeing wage increases. That’s, that’s sort of a natural thing to be seeing in a strong economy. And what we’re seeing is—we don’t see anything that’s troubling in the sense of—what would be troubling would be, you know, very wide across the economy, wages at unsustainable levels without high inflation. In other words, wages in excess of productivity and inflation, you know, by a meaningful amount broadly across the economy, sort of forcing companies to keep raising prices and getting into a wage–price cycle. That’s, that’s the old formula for—one of the old formulas for having high inflation. We don’t see anything like that now. We do see high wages. We see them for, for people who are mostly new, you know, entering into new jobs, many of them in low-skilled jobs. And, but we, we do think—you’ve got to—you’ve got to think in the labor market right now, where, where supply and demand are just not matched up well. And, you know, we think it’s a flexible economy and, and it will clear. There will—there will be a level at which supply and demand meet. And that’ll—we think that’ll, that’ll be happening in coming months. So—but the last thing I’ll say is, again, if you look at, at the forecasts, we are going to be in a very strong labor market pretty quickly here. There are still a big group of unemployed people. And, you know, we’re not going to forget about them. We’re going—we’re going to do everything we can to get people back into work and give them the chance to work. But there’s bit how we’re looking at the—at the labor market.","Q&A","Press Conf","","584","2021-06"
"2021-06-16","Good afternoon. At the Federal Reserve, we are strongly committed to achieving the monetary policy goals that Congress has given us: maximum employment and price stability. Today the Federal Open Market Committee kept interest rates near zero and maintained our asset purchases. These measures, along with our strong guidance on interest rates and on our balance sheet, will ensure that monetary policy will continue to deliver powerful support to the economy until the recovery is complete. Widespread vaccinations, along with unprecedented fiscal policy actions, are also providing strong support to the recovery. Indicators of economic activity and employment have continued to strengthen, and real GDP this year appears to be on track to post its fastest rate of increase in decades. Much of this rapid growth reflects the continued bounceback in activity from depressed levels. The sectors most adversely affected by the pandemic remain weak but have shown improvement. Household spending is rising at a rapid pace, boosted by the ongoing reopening of the economy, fiscal support, and accommodative financial conditions. The housing sector is strong, and business investment is increasing at a solid pace. In some industries, near- term supply constraints are restraining activity. Forecasts from FOMC participants for economic growth this year have been revised up since our March Summary of Economic Projections. Even so, the recovery is incomplete, and risks to the economic outlook remain. As with overall economic activity, conditions in the labor market have continued to improve, although the pace of improvement has been uneven. Employment rose 419,000 per month, on average, in April and May, with the leisure and hospitality sector continuing to post notable gains. Employment in this sector and the economy as a whole remains well below pre- has not moved up from the low rates that have prevailed for most of the past year. Factors related to the pandemic, such as caregiving needs, ongoing fears of the virus, and unemployment insurance payments, appear to be weighing on employment growth. These factors should wane in coming months against a backdrop of rising vaccinations, leading to more rapid gains in employment. Looking ahead, FOMC participants project the labor market to continue to improve, with the median projection for the unemployment rate standing at 4.5 percent at the end of this year and declining to 3.5 percent by the end of 2023. The economic downturn has not fallen equally on all Americans, and those least able to shoulder the burden have been hardest hit. In particular, despite progress, joblessness continues to fall disproportionately on lower-wage workers in the service sector and on African Americans and Hispanics. Inflation has increased notably in recent months. The 12-month change in PCE prices was 3.6 percent in April and will likely remain elevated in coming months before moderating. Part of the increase reflects the very low readings from early in the pandemic falling out of the calculation as well as the pass-through of past increases in oil prices to, to consumer energy prices. Beyond these effects, we are also seeing upward pressure on prices from the rebound in spending as the economy continues to reopen, particularly as supply bottlenecks have limited how quickly production in some sectors can respond in the near term. These bottleneck effects have been larger than anticipated, and FOMC participants have revised up their projections for, for inflation notably for this year. As these transitory supply effects abate, inflation is expected The process of reopening the economy is unprecedented, as was the shutdown at the onset of the pandemic. As the reopening continues, shifts in demand can be large and rapid, and bottlenecks, hiring difficulties, and other constraints could continue to limit how quickly supply can adjust, raising the possibility that inflation could turn out to be higher and more persistent than we expect. Our new framework for monetary policy emphasizes the importance of having well-anchored inflation expectations, both to foster price stability and to enhance our ability to promote our broad-based and inclusive maximum-employment goal. Indicators of longer-term inflation expectations have generally reversed the declines seen earlier in the pandemic and have moved into a range that appears broadly consistent with our longer-run inflation goal of 2 percent. If we saw signs that the path of inflation or longer-term inflation expectations were moving materially and persistently beyond levels consistent with our goal, we’d be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy. The pandemic continues to pose risks to the economic outlook. Progress on vaccinations has limited the spread of COVID-19 and will likely continue to reduce the effects of the public health crisis on the economy. However, the pace of vaccinations has slowed, and new strains of the virus remain a risk. Continued progress on vaccinations will support a return to more normal economic conditions. The Fed’s policy actions have been guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people, along with our responsibilities to promote the stability of the financial system. As the Committee reiterated in today’s policy statement, with inflation having run persistently below 2 percent, we will aim to achieve inflation accommodative stance of monetary policy until these employment and inflation outcomes are achieved. With regard to interest rates, we continue to expect that it will be appropriate to maintain the current 0 to ¼ percent target range for the federal funds rate until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee’s assessment of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time. As is evident in the SEP, many participants forecast that these favorable economic conditions will be met somewhat sooner than previously projected; the median projection for the appropriate level of the federal funds rate now lies above the effective lower bound in 2023. Of course, these projections do not represent a Committee decision or plan, and no one knows with any certainty where the economy will be a couple of years from now. More important than any forecast is the fact that, whenever liftoff comes, policy will remain highly accommodative. Reaching the conditions for liftoff will mainly signal that the recovery is strong and no longer requires holding rates near zero. In addition, we are continuing to increase—continuing to increase our holdings of Treasury securities by at least $80 billion per month and of agency mortgage-backed securities by at least $40 billion per month until substantial further progress has been made toward our maximum-employment and price-stability goals. The increase in our balance sheet since March 2020 has materially eased financial conditions and is providing substantial support to the economy. December. While reaching the standard of “substantial further progress” is still a ways off, participants expect that progress will continue. In coming meetings, the Committee will continue to assess the economy’s progress toward our goals. As we have said, we will provide advance notice before announcing any decision to make changes to our purchases. On a final note, we made a technical adjustment today to the Federal Reserve’s administered rates. The IOER and overnight RRP rates were adjusted upward by 5 basis points in order to keep the federal funds rate well within the target range and to support smooth functioning in money markets. This technical adjustment has no bearing on the appropriate path for the federal funds rate or stance of monetary policy. To conclude, we understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission. We at the Fed will do everything we can to support the economy for as long as it takes to complete the recovery. Thank you.","Opening Statement","Press Conf","","1277","2021-06"
"2021-06-16","It’s not, honestly. And, you know, the funny thing, you would think that it would, but we’ll have to see. It’s, it’s possible that that would not be the case. That’s going to be an empirical question.","Q&A","Press Conf","","37","2021-06"
"2021-06-16","So on the—on the facility, we think it’s doing its job. We think it’s doing—the reverse repo facility is, is doing what it’s supposed to do, which is to provide a floor under money market rates and keep the federal funds rate well within its—well within its range. So we’re not concerned with it. It’s doing—you have an unusual situation where the Treasury General Account is, is shrinking and bill supply is shrinking. And so there’s, there’s downward pressure—we’re buying assets—there’s downward pressure on short-term rates, and that facility is, is doing what we think it’s supposed to do.

"2021-06-16","You know, so as part of our year-and-a-half-long process, the review that we did and came out with at the end of that with the—with the new Statement on Longer- Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, we looked carefully at the idea. We’ve all read all the literature around different formulas for makeup and things like that. And we concluded—and, you know, I strongly agree—that it’s not wise to, to wed yourself to a particular formulation of that. So we did adopt a discretionary—there’s an element of discretion in it. You know, it says that we will seek to—seek inflation that runs moderately above 2 percent for some time. And it’s, it’s meant to create a broad sense that we want inflation to average 2 percent over time. And that under the old—under the old formula, under the old framework, what was happening was, 2 percent was a ceiling because all of the errors were below. You were always getting back to 2 percent. So you were bouncing back and forth between 1½ and 2, and we wanted them to be centered around 2. So, so that’s, that’s the approach that we’re taking. And you’re right, it’s not—it’s not a formulaic approach. We were clear on that when we announced the framework. Was there another part of your question, Craig?","Q&A","Press Conf","","220","2021-06"

"2021-06-16","So our intention for this process is that it will be orderly, methodical, and transparent. And I can just tell you, we, we, we see real value in communicating well in advance what our thinking is. And we’ll try to be clear. And, as I mentioned, we’ll, we’ll give advance notice before announcing a decision to taper. And so all I can say is that we, we think it’s important—we think where the balance sheet’s concerned, a lot of notice, as much transparency as we can give, and as far—as far in advance as we can to give people a chance to adjust their expectations. And, you know, we expect to be in that business until we reach substantial further progress and then have a—have a decision. Again, I have nothing further on time. It wouldn’t be appropriate to say. We’re going to have to see more data. We’re a ways away from substantial further progress, we think. But we’re making progress.","Q&A","Press Conf","","162","2021-06"
"2021-06-16","On your first question, the judgment of when we have arrived at substantial further progress is one that the Committee will make. And it would not be appropriate for me to lay out particular numbers that do or do not—that do or do not qualify. That is—that is, you know, the process that we’re beginning now at the next meeting. We will begin, meeting by meeting, to, to assess that progress and talk about what we—what we think we’re seeing and, and just do all of the things that you do to sort of clarify your thinking around the process of deciding whether and how to adjust the pace and composition of asset purchases. In terms of the, the, the two hikes—so let me say a couple things first of all, not for the first time, about the—about the dot plot. These are, of course, individual projections. They’re not a Committee forecast, they’re not a plan. And we did not actually have a discussion of whether liftoff is appropriate at any particular year, because discussing liftoff now would be— would be highly premature, wouldn’t make any sense. If you look at the transcripts from five years ago, you’ll see that sometimes people mention their rate path in their interventions. Often they don’t. And the last thing to say is, the dots are not a great forecaster of, of future rate However, so let me talk about this, this, this meeting. The Committee spelled out, as you know, in our FOMC statements the conditions that it expects to see before an adjustment in the target range is made. And it’s outcome based, it’s not time based. And, as I mentioned, it’s labor market conditions consistent with maximum employment, inflation at 2 percent and on track to exceed 2 percent. In the projections, it gives some sense of how participants see the economy evolving in their most likely case. And, honestly, the main message I would take away from the SEP is that participants—many, many participants are more comfortable that the economic conditions in the Committee’s forward guidance will be met somewhat sooner than previously anticipated. And that would be a welcome development. If such outcomes materialize, it means the economy will have made faster progress toward our goals. So the other thing I’ll say is, rate increases are really not at all the focus of the Committee. The focus of the Committee is the current state of the economy. But in terms of our tools, it’s about asset purchases. That’s what we’re thinking about. Liftoff is, is well into the future. The conditions for liftoff—we’re very far from maximum employment, for example. It’s, it’s a consideration for the future. So the near-term thing is really—the real near-term discussion, discussion that will begin is really about the, the path of asset purchases. And, as I mentioned, we had a discussion about that today and expect to, in future meetings, continue to think about our progress.","Q&A","Press Conf","","493","2021-06"

"2021-06-16","I think it’s both. You know, I think, clearly, since March what’s happened is, people have grown more confident in these very strong outcomes, that they’ll be strong labor demand. We’ve also seen—we have seen inflation above target, though, and I think even though, you know, in, in our forecasters’ case, they do see inflation coming back down over ’22 and ’23 into, into areas that are very consistent with our—with our mandate. Nonetheless, the risk is, is something that can factor into people’s thinking about appropriate monetary policy. The thing is, you know, these are 18 different forecasts, and I can’t stand here and say exactly what was in all 18 people’s minds. But that, that is something that I think can factor into things as well—factor into our forecast as well.","Q&A","Press Conf","","133","2021-06"
"2021-06-16","So inflation has come in above expectations over the last few months. But if you look behind the headline numbers, you’ll see that the incoming data are, are consistent with the view that prices—that prices that are driving that higher inflation are from categories that are being directly affected by the recovery from the pandemic and the reopening of the economy. So, for example, the experience with, with lumber prices is, is illustrative of this. The thought is that prices like that that have moved up really quickly because of the shortages and bottlenecks and the like, they should stop going up, and at some point, they, they, in some cases, should actually go down. And we did see that in the case of lumber. Another example where we haven’t seen that yet is prices for used cars, which accounted for more than a third of the total increase in core inflation. Used car prices are going up because of sort of a perfect storm of very strong demand and limited supply. It’s going up at just an amazing annual rate. But we do think that it makes sense that that would stop, and that in fact it would reverse over time. So we think we’ll be seeing some of that. When will we be seeing it? We’re not sure. That narrative seems, still seems quite likely to prove correct, although, you know, as I pointed out at the last press conference, the, the timing of that is, is pretty uncertain, and so are the, the effects in the near term. But over time, it seems data. I’ll, I’ll also say that the labor market is going to be important, both for the maximum- employment goal, but also for inflation. And we’ll be looking at that. And, and as I—as I mentioned, we expect and I expect that we’ll see increases in supply over coming months as the factors that we believe have been suppressing supply abate, wane, move down. So I, I can’t give you an exact number or an exact time, but I would say that we do expect inflation to move down. If you look at the—if you look at the forecast for 2021 and—sorry, 2022 and 2023 among my colleagues on the, on the Federal Open Market Committee, you will see that people do expect inflation to move down meaningfully toward our goal. And I think the full range of, of, of inflation projections for 2023 falls between 2 and 2.3 percent, which is consistent with our—with our goals.","Q&A","Press Conf","","423","2021-06"

"2021-07-28","Great. Thank you. So more detail on substantial further progress. So let’s talk about the maximum-employment part of that. As you know, with maximum employment—unlike with, with price stability, where we can target a number of 2 percent on average—with maximum employment, there isn’t a single number that we can target. That the— we monitor a broad range of, of, of data about different aspects of the labor market. There’s unemployment, unemployment among different, different age groups, and such. There’s participation. There’s wages. There’s all kinds of flow data. And we look at all of it to try to arrive at a picture of what—of what is maximum employment. So there isn’t—I can’t give you a, a, a set of numbers—for example, a numerical threshold like we used for a time back in 2012, I guess it was. We didn’t do that here.

"2021-07-28","Sure. I’d be glad to. So if you look, again, if you look at the, the most recent inflation report, what you see is that it came in significantly higher than expected. But essentially all of the overshoot can be tied to a handful of categories. It isn’t the kind of inflation that’s spread broadly across the economy. It’s new, used, and rental cars. It’s airplane tickets. It’s hotels. And it’s a couple of other things. And each of those has a story attached to it that is—that is really about the reopening of the economy. So we look at that, and we think that those are temporary things because the, the supply side will respond. The economy will adapt. We have a very adaptive, adaptable, flexible economy and labor market. And it’s a real—a real asset that we have. And so we think that inflation should move down over time. Now, we don’t have any—much confidence, let’s say, in the timing of that or the size of the effects in the near term. I would say, in the near term, that I, I, I will say, though, that, you know, we—inflation is half of our mandate. Price stability is half of our mandate. And if we were to see inflation moving up to levels persistently that were—that were above, significantly, materially above our goal and particularly if inflation expectations were to move up, we would use our tools to guide inflation back down to 2 percent. So we won’t have an extended period of, of high inflation. We think that, that some of it will, will fall away naturally as the process of reopening the economy moves through. And it could take some time. In any case, we will use our tools over time as appropriate to make sure that we do have inflation that averages 2 percent over time.","Q&A","Press Conf","","311","2021-07"
"2021-07-28","Thanks. So it’s an—it’s an important feature of this recovery is how uneven it is.

And, and now Europe is having a stronger rebound as well. So it’s a feature of our economy. Now, how does it affect our policy? In, in a couple of ways, potentially.

"2021-07-28","That, that would, again, be a question for the Committee. But I would really say, the guidance that you’re talking about is really the guidance to do with liftoff, right? That’s—what the guidance is for liftoff, we had to have labor market conditions consistent with full employment, inflation at 2 percent and on track to run—to run moderately above 2 percent for some time. It really isn’t relevant now. It—because we’re really—we’re looking at, at tapering asset purchases. We’re clearly a ways away from considering raising interest rates. It’s not something that, that is on our radar screen right now. You know, so when we get to that question, when we start to get to the question of, of liftoff, which, which we are not at all at now or near now, that’s when we’ll ask that question.

We’ll be—try to provide additional clarity about our thinking, both in the—in the postmeeting statement and in the minutes and in the public comments that people make. You know, our, our approach here has been to be as transparent as we can. We have not reached substantial further progress yet. So we’re, we’re not there, and we see our ways as having some—we see ourselves as having some ground to cover to get there. So that’s what I would say.

"2021-07-28","Good afternoon. At the Federal Reserve, we are strongly committed to achieving the monetary policy goals that Congress has given us: maximum employment and price stability. Today the Federal Open Market Committee kept interest rates near zero and maintained our asset purchases. These measures, along with our strong guidance on interest rates and on our balance sheet, will ensure that monetary policy will continue to support the economy until the recovery is complete. Progress in vaccinations and unprecedented fiscal policy actions are also providing strong support to the recovery. Indicators of economic activity and employment have continued to strengthen, and real GDP this year appears to be on track to post its fastest rate of increase in decades. Much of this rapid growth reflects the continued bounceback in activity from depressed levels. The sectors most adversely affected by the pandemic have shown improvement but have not fully recovered. Household spending is rising at an especially rapid pace, boosted by the ongoing reopening of the economy and ongoing policy support. The housing sector remains very strong, and business investment is increasing at a solid pace. In some industries, near-term supply constraints are restraining activity. These constraints are particularly acute in the motor vehicle industry, where worldwide shortages of semiconductors have sharply curtailed production so far this year. As with overall economic activity, conditions in the labor market have continued to improve. Demand for labor is very strong, and employment rose 850,000 in June, with the The unemployment rate in June—in June was 5.9 percent, and this figure understates the shortfall in employment, particularly as participation in the labor market has not moved up from the low rates that have prevailed for most of the past year. Factors related to the pandemic, such as caregiving needs, ongoing fears of the virus, and unemployment insurance payments, appear to be weighing on employment growth. These factors should wane in coming months, leading to strong gains in employment. The economic downturn has not fallen equally on all Americans, and those least able to shoulder the burden have been hardest hit. In particular, despite progress, joblessness continues to fall disproportionately on lower-wage workers in the service sector and on African Americans and Hispanics. Inflation has increased notably and will likely remain elevated in coming months before moderating. As the economy continues to reopen and spending rebounds, we are seeing upward pressure on prices, particularly because supply bottlenecks in some sectors have limited how quickly production can respond in the near term. These bottleneck effects have been larger than anticipated, but as these transitory supply effects abate, inflation is expected to drop back toward our longer-run goal. Very low readings from early in the pandemic as well as the pass-through of past increases in oil prices to consumer energy prices also contribute to the increase, although these base effects and energy effects are receding. The process of reopening the economy is unprecedented, as was the shutdown at the onset of the pandemic. As the reopening continues, bottlenecks, hiring difficulties, and other constraints could continue to limit how quickly supply can adjust, raising the possibility that to, to foster price stability and to enhance our ability to promote our broad-based and inclusive maximum-employment goal. Indicators of long-term inflation expectations appear broadly consistent with our longer- run inflation goal of 2 percent. If we saw signs that the path of inflation or longer-term inflation expectations were moving materially and persistently beyond levels consistent with our goal, we’d be prepared to adjust the stance of policy. The effects of the pandemic on the economy have continued to diminish, but risks to the economic outlook remain. Progress on vaccinations has limited the spread of COVID-19. However, the pace of vaccinations has slowed, and the Delta strain of the virus is spreading quickly in some areas. Continued progress on vaccinations would support a return to more normal economic conditions. The Fed’s policy actions have been guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people, along with our responsibilities to promote the stability of the financial system. As the Committee reiterated in today’s policy statement, with inflation having run persistently below 2 percent, we will aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time so that inflation averages 2 percent over time and longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2 percent. We expect to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until these employment and inflation outcomes are achieved. With regard to interest rates, we continue to expect that it will be appropriate to maintain the current 0 to ¼ percent target range for the federal funds rate until labor market conditions for some time. In addition, we are continuing to—continuing to increase our holdings of Treasury securities by at least $80 billion per month and of agency MBS by at least $40 billion per month until substantial further progress has been made toward our maximum-employment and price- stability goals. Our asset purchases have been a critical tool. They helped preserve financial stability and market functioning early in the pandemic and since then have helped foster accommodative financial conditions to support the economy. At our meeting that concluded earlier today, the Committee continued to discuss the progress made toward our—toward our goals since the Committee adopted its asset purchase guidance last December. We also reviewed some considerations around how our asset purchases might be adjusted, including their pace and composition, once economic conditions warrant a change. Participants expect that the economy will continue to move toward our standard of “substantial further progress.” In coming meetings, the Committee will again assess the economy’s progress toward our goals, and the timing of any change in the pace of our asset purchases will depend on the incoming data. As we’ve said, we will provide advance notice before making any changes to our purchases. On a final note, we announced the establishment of two standing repo facilities, a domestic one for primary dealers and additional banks and another for foreign and international monetary authorities. These facilities will serve as backstops in money markets to support the effective implementation of monetary policy and smooth market functioning. everything we can to support the economy for as long as it takes to complete the recovery. Thank you.","Opening Statement","Press Conf","","1046","2021-07"

"2021-07-28","I certainly don’t, don’t have that in mind. No. Look, we—as you know, we’re targeting a moderate overshoot of 2 percent inflation for some time. We, we want inflation expectations to be centered on, on 2 percent. We feel like they may be a little bit below that. So the bigger picture is that, you know, that, that, that would be a healthy thing. This is a different thing. This is—this is not that. That was the kind of inflation we were thinking about that comes from, you know, from a very, very strong labor market and a—and a booming that we’re seeing. As the economy reopens with vaccination and fiscal support and monetary policy support, the supply side—just all over the world, you’re seeing the same thing, which is, it just can’t keep up. And there are labor shortages in, in a lot of places, the same sort of thing. So, you know, there’s, there’s absolutely no sense of panic. I just—I’ve explained, I think, several times here today that the best—my, my best estimate is that this is something that will pass. It’s really a shock to the economy that will pass through. And, you know, if you—if you look at where forecasters are—people who actually write down a forecast for a living—very, very strongly they see it that way. Now, we—but, you know, are—we’re actually responsible for this, though, so we have to take seriously the risk, the risk case, which is that inflation will be more persistent, that it might actually move inflation expectations up, and that we might—that the kind of things that might require a response. We, again, we don’t see that now. But we, we have to be on the alert for it. And people have to understand and believe that we will react if, if we need to. And we will. But, again, it’s not—it’s not my base case. My base case is that—is, as I’ve said repeatedly, is that inflation will move back down. And no, we’re not—we, we have not at all changed our view, and I haven’t changed my view that inflation running above 2 percent, moderately above 2 percent, is a desirable thing. This is not moderately above 2 percent. This is well above 2 percent. But it’s also not the kind of inflation we were looking for. This is really driven by a supply-side shock.","Q&A","Press Conf","","398","2021-07"
"2021-07-28","So wages have moved up. A lot of that is driven by new hires. And it’s—a lot of it is driven at relatively low-paid jobs in the service industries as people come back. So that’s not troubling. And we, we don’t see—there, there is a form of wage inflation that can lead to price inflation, and we’re not seeing that right now. And that really is if what we call “unit labor costs” move up and, and, and, which really puts—move up in a way that is—that is hard for companies to manage and puts them in a situation where they have to accept substantially lower margins or raise prices. Now, when it happens gradually, when that—if you—we’ve seen in a long expansion, sometimes unit labor costs do move up and, and put some pressure on margins. In a long expansion, that’s been happening late in the expansion. That’s not a problem, either. The problem is if it happens in a way that pushes firms broadly into raising prices. It was called the “wage–price spiral.” We don’t see that now. This is something that was a feature of the high inflationary era of the Great Inflation, but it’s not a feature now. And we don’t see that now. Of course, we’ll be watching it. And this is one of the reasons why we’re watching so carefully to see whether labor force—whether people do come back and accept jobs. Given the very large number of job openings and the very large number of unemployed people, we’d like to see, you know, those— inflation and productivity, is a—is a good thing.","Q&A","Press Conf","","269","2021-07"
"2021-07-28","So in any decisions about the timing, and I did not—if I—if I said we’re looking at wanting a couple more months of data, I wasn’t—I’m not meaning to suggest views on, on what timing will be appropriate. And those views ultimately track, track back to people’s views about the economy and, and what will happen as we make progress towards, towards our—towards our goal. So that’s, that’s really what it is. And I, I—we will, of course, as we—you know, we’re going to continue to try to provide clarity as appropriate on, on timing, pace, and composition. But, today, I’ve, I’ve given you what I can give you because, again, this, this was the first, really, I would say, deep dive on the issues of timing, pace, and composition. And it was a good meeting. And—but no decisions are made, and, and I’m just not in a position to, to give you much guidance, really any guidance, on the actual timing. I—but I will say we’re making progress. We expect further progress. And we expect that, if, if things go well, then we will—we will reach that goal. And when we reach it and the Committee is comfortable that we have reached it, then, then we’ll taper at that point. I can’t, I really—there’s nothing I can say about Jackson Hole. You know, I’m in—we’re in the process of writing that speech. And I am going to give a speech, and—but I, I, I wouldn’t want to—I wouldn’t want to say what will be in there at this point.","Q&A","Press Conf","","260","2021-07"
"2021-07-28","The concept of “transitory” is really this: It is that the increases will happen. We’re not saying they will reverse. That’s not what “transitory” means. It means that the increases in prices will happen, so there will be inflation but that the process of inflation will stop so that—so that there won’t be further—when, when we think of inflation, we really think of inflation going up year upon year upon year upon year. That’s inflation. When you have inflation for 12 months or whatever it might be—I’m just taking an example; I’m not making an estimate—then, then you have a price increase, but you don’t have an inflation process. And so part of that just is that, if it doesn’t affect longer-term inflation expectations, then it’s very likely not to infect—to affect the process of inflation going forward. So what, what I mean by “transitory” is just something that doesn’t leave a permanent mark on the inflation process. Again, we don’t mean—I don’t mean that, that, that, that, you know, producers are going to take those price increases back. That’s, that’s not the idea. It’s just that they won’t go on indefinitely. So to the extent people are, are, are implementing price increases because raw materials are going up or labor costs or something’s going up, you know, the question, really, for inflation really is, does that mean they’re going to go up the next year by the same amount? So you’re going to be in a process where inflation, the inflation process, gets going. And, and that happens because people’s expectations about future inflation move up. And we don’t we have two mandates: maximum employment and price stability. Price stability, for us, means inflation averaging 2 percent over time. And so we’ve got to be very careful about that. But, but I, I, I think it’s a good point that it’s, it’s a term—what it really means is temporary. But then you’ve got to understand that it doesn’t mean that the—that the increases will be taken back. Some of them will be, but, but that’s not really what it means. In terms of—so we’re, we’re working virtually here, and we’ll be coming back down the road in a couple of months, starting to bring people back here at the Board of Governors in Washington. And, you know, we’re going to follow public health guidance and things like that. We really haven’t made the fundamental decisions about exactly what that will look like. And it’ll depend on, to some extent, on what—on what, you know, CDC guidance looks like when we actually do bring people back in.","Q&A","Press Conf","","437","2021-07"
"2021-07-28","Sure. So if you remember the, the summer wave last year of COVID, which was largely southern and western states, the economy just performed much better expect that, that it would have a real impact on the economy. And it was much less than, than people thought. People—what’s happened is, first of all, many people are vaccinated. They’re going on with their lives. Secondly, we’ve kind of learned to live with it. A lot of industries have, have kind of improvised their way around it—particularly, for example, buying a new home. That, that process of buying a new home very quickly moved to much more of a virtual process. And so they were able to, you know, to, to do that. And other industries as well have gone to take-out and, you know, no-contact things. It’s—so that can all—it seems like we’ve learned to, to handle this. Now, I think people would like to get back to, to, you know, the way things were. And I, I, I hope to some extent, we will over time. You know, of course, the big wave we had last winter did have significant employment effects, particularly in, you know, hospitality and leisure and other entertainment—other, other areas with a lot of direct contact. A lot of jobs were lost then because that was a very strong wave that happened in, in, in the winter months last year, just before the vaccines arrived. So with Delta, we’re just going to have to watch. Again, with, with, with a reasonably high percentage of the country vaccinated and the vaccine apparently being effective—we’re not experts on this—but it, it seems like the—a good—a good going-in estimate would be that the effects will probably be less. There probably won’t be significant lockdowns and things like that. But, again, those, those are not decisions for us or, or, or—nor is it something we’re be— we’d be expert in. two for the—for the—for the Delta wave to go. I’m not saying this’ll happen, but that it’s easy to imagine that. It’s also easy to imagine that some people might say, you know what? I’m just going to—I’m just going to wait a couple of months before going back to work. Wouldn’t be hard to imagine that happening. If, if schools don’t open, then caretakers have to stay home. And if people don’t go back into the labor force, then the job growth won’t be as strong, those kinds of things. So I don’t—it doesn’t—it doesn’t—again, sitting here today, not being able to really know the future—it doesn’t seem as though the effects will be very large. But there may be effects. And they—it may be that the effect is to slow the economy down just for a period of months—or not. There are many parts of the country where it might not have an effect, and we’re just going to have to, to see what the economic effects are.","Q&A","Press Conf","","490","2021-07"
"2021-07-28","Well, so in terms of what’s been happening in bond markets, I don’t think there’s a real consensus on, on what explains the moves between the last meeting and this meeting. We’ve seen the long-term yields go down significantly. Some of it is a fall in real yields, which may have been connected to—some speculate—connected to sentiment around the, the spread of the Delta variant and concern about growth. There was also some decline in inflation compensation, which has significantly reversed. And there, there are also so-called technical factors, which is where you put things that you can’t quite explain. So I, I, I don’t see in any of that that there is really anything that challenges the What we said was that, in particular, when we see a very strong labor market, high levels of employment, low levels of unemployment, that won’t be enough for us to raise interest rates until we see some inflation. Of course, what we have today is kind of the opposite. We’ve got, you know, 7 or 8 million people, fewer people, at work than were at work before the pandemic. So we’re, you know, we’re, we’re a ways away from full maximum employment. But we have high inflation, so it’s kind of the opposite case. And we have to—we have to deal with that. Any central bank has to deal with that by looking at the inflation and asking whether it is broad based and likely to be persistent and, and, and whether inflation expectations are implicated in a way that, that could cause them to rise. So we’re monitoring that very carefully, and we’re prepared to use our tools as appropriate. But, again, I think our—I think our framework is pretty well understood. And, and I think the real test of it will be down the road when it’s time to think about raising interest rates and, and how we assess, assess that set of issues.","Q&A","Press Conf","","324","2021-07"

And there may be a bit of a speed limit on that. There, there’s research that suggests that there is a speed limit on that.

"2021-09-22","So within—let’s just take the household surveys generally. The New York Fed survey, let me talk about that specifically, and this is from the New York Fed. It’s only an eight-year-old survey, and it does seem as though the, they’re looking three years out. And it seems like there’s a high correlation between three-year and one-year. For the most part, surveys are showing that households expect higher inflation in the near term but not in the longer term. And that’s also what expectations are showing. So there are many, many different inflation measures, of course. And that’s why we have this thing called the CIE, which is the, it’s an index of—it’s market-based measures, it’s professional forecasters, and it’s household surveys. And you just put them all—it’s not, you know, it doesn’t have a lot of grand theory about it. You put them all in, and you measure the change. So you should be—and, also, you measure things like the dispersion and that sort of thing, so you can look at all that. And, you know, it tells a story of inflation expectations moving up. Many of the different measures will also show inflation expectations moving back up to where they were in, say, 2013, which was before the really—the drop in inflation expectations broadly happened in ’14 and ’15—around then. So that’s not a troubling thing. But, you know, inflation expectations are terribly important. We spend a lot of time watching them. And if we did see them moving up in a troubling way and running persistently above levels that are really consistent with our mandate, then, you know, we would certainly react to that.

"2021-09-22","Right, so the point of the broad and inclusive goal was not to target a particular unemployment rate for any particular group. Really, we look at a broad range of—a very broad range of metrics when we think about what maximum employment is. And one of the things we look at is unemployment rates and participation rates and wages for different demographic and age groups and that kind of thing. So we will do all of that. So I think if you look back, what were we really thinking? So we all saw the benefits of a strong labor market. If you look at the last two or three years of, before the pandemic hit, you saw—after a lot of long progress, you saw a really strong labor market. And you saw wages at the low end moving up faster than everywhere else—something that’s great to see. We also saw the lowest unemployment rates for minorities of various, you know, for African Americans, for example, and also participation rates. We saw a really, really healthy set of dynamics. And, by the way, we also—there was no reason why it couldn’t continue. There recession. So I was very much thinking that the country would really benefit from a few more years of this. It would have been—so we’re all quite eager to get back to that. We also said we wouldn’t raise rates just in response to very low unemployment, in the absence of inflation. So that was another aspect of it, because we saw that that really benefited labor market participants in a broad and inclusive way. That’s, of course, not the current situation. We have significant slack in the economy and inflation well above target, not moderately above target. So that’s, really, how we think about it. It isn’t really just targeting the headline numbers, but it’s about taking all of those things into account in your thinking about what constitutes maximum employment.","Q&A","Press Conf","","324","2021-09"

This is a persistent gap, and it’s very hard to explain based on typical metrics. It’s just, it’s quite troubling, but it really is—you know, we have, you know, famously broad and blunt tools. I think eliminating inequality and racial discrimination and racial disparities and that kind of thing is really something that fiscal policy and other policies—frankly, education policies and that kind of thing—are better at focusing on.

"2021-09-22","So, I missed the first few words, but I think I got your question. So it’s just very important that the debt ceiling be raised in a timely fashion so that the United States can pay its bills when and as they come due. That’s a critically important thing. The failure to do that is something that could result in severe reactions, severe damage to the economy and to the financial markets. And it’s just not something that we could contemplate, that we should contemplate. I’m not going to comment on particular tactics or things like that. I’m just going to say that I think we can all agree that the United States shouldn’t default on any of its obligations—should pay them when and as due. And that, you know, no one should assume that the Fed or anyone else can protect the markets or the economy in the event of a failure—fully protect in the event of a failure to, you know, to make sure that we do pay those debts when they’re due.","Q&A","Press Conf","","175","2021-09"

I’m just curious, under what circumstances would the Fed actually consider revoking a financial holding company’s license? And if the indiscretions at Wells Fargo, in your opinion, warrant such an action?","Q&A","Press Conf","","88","2021-09"
"2021-09-22","So we’re, of course, very closely monitoring Wells Fargo’s efforts to fix its widespread and pervasive problems. They represent a serious matter to us, and the firm is required to remediate them. And we will take appropriate supervisory action if the firm fails to meet our expectation. We continue to hold the firm accountable for its deficiencies with an unprecedented asset cap that will stay in place until the firm has comprehensively fixed its problems. And we’re not going to remove that asset cap until that’s done. So bottom line is, we’ll take strong supervisory action if a firm is engaging in unsafe and unsound practices or violating laws. But I can’t speak to our confidential supervisory assessments of any individual bank.","Q&A","Press Conf","","122","2021-09"
"2021-09-22","So that’s, yeah, that’s a good question. So, you know, the five-year review that we do under this unusual provision of law where all of the Reserve Bank presidents are reviewed for reappointment at the same time every five years, that is really a broad review about their leadership of the institution, their performance on the FOMC, all of those things. And if there were a concern—a public concern or a private concern—about something that someone had done, we wouldn’t wait for the five-year. We wouldn’t wait that day if there were concerns. you can trade financial instruments, but not specific ones like bank debt. You can’t trade during the FOMC period and during the meeting—the blackout period and then during the meeting. And then you disclose all this, and we have disclosed it for years. So all of these things have been going—to the extent they’ve been going on, they’ve been a matter of public record. And, you know—but, nonetheless—so that—you know, it was seeming to work just okay. And now you look at it, and you see this, and you think, “We need to do better.” And we will. But you’re right, but it has not been part of the process. And, appropriately, I don’t think it should have been. I mean, I wouldn’t blame the people who conduct that review. I really think, if someone had raised concerns or if we’d had concerns, then it would have been, but it wouldn’t have been part of that process. It would have been raised instantly, rather than once every five years.","Q&A","Press Conf","","262","2021-09"
"2021-09-22","Well, let me say one thing. You’re looking for conditions consistent with maximum employment to lift off, and those conditions can change over time. So you’re not necessarily bound by a particular level of the unemployment rate or the participation rate or anything else like that, which can change over time. But more to your point, really, we actually complementary; they’re somehow in tension. And if we judge that’s effect—that is the case, what it says is, we take into account the employment shortfalls and inflation deviations and the potentially different time horizons over which employment and inflation are projected to return to levels judged consistent with the mandate. So, we used to call that the balanced-approach paragraph because it had those words. So it’s a very difficult situation for any central bank to be—pardon me—to be in a situation where the two goals are in tension. And that paragraph tries to address it by saying we would sort of weigh the equities between the two. How long will it take, and how big are the gaps, and that kind of thing. We don’t really think we’re in that—we’re sort of in that situation, I’d say, in a short-term way.

"2021-09-22","About the United States, no. Corporate defaults are very low in the United States right now. Corporate leverage built up over the course of the long expansion that ended with the pandemic. We were very concerned in the last year or so. We were concerned in happened at the beginning of the crisis, we were very concerned that there would be a wave of defaults. It didn’t happen, potentially—I mean, to a significant extent because of the CARES Act and the response that we undertook and all that. It was a, you know, a much stronger response than we’ve ever had. And I think for whatever reason now, you have very, very low default rates now among corporate debt. You know, the Evergrande situation seems very particular to China, which has very high debt for an emerging market economy, really the highest that any emerging market economy has had. And the government has been working to get that under control. This is part of that effort. The government put new strictures in place for highly leveraged companies. And Evergrande is dealing with those strictures, and it’s something they’re managing. In terms of the implications for us, there isn’t, there’s not a lot of direct United States exposure.

Not—we don’t expect to be in that situation, but I do think it would be wiser at that point to go ahead and speed up the taper, just because the two are then working in the same direction.","Q&A","Press Conf","","87","2021-09"
"2021-09-22","Sure, I’d be glad to. So we think it’s really important that the central bank maintain a stable currency and payment system for the public’s benefit. That’s one of our jobs. We also live in a time of transformational innovation around digital payments, and we need to make sure that the Fed is able to continue to deliver to the public a stable and trustworthy currency and payment system. So there’s extensive private innovation, a lot of which is taking place outside the regulatory perimeter. And innovation is fantastic. Our economy runs on innovation. But where the public’s money is concerned, we need to make sure that appropriate regulatory protections are in place, and today they really are not in some cases. So with that in mind and with the creation of myriad private currencies and currency-like products, we’re working proactively to evaluate whether to issue a CBDC and, if so, in what form. We have two broad workstreams, one of which is really technology, both at the Board and in the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston’s work with MIT—the other of which is to identify, scope out, deal with, analyze the various public policy issues. As you mentioned, we do intend to publish a discussion paper soon that will be the basis for a period of public engagement— engagement with many different groups, including elected officials, around these issues.

I think it’s more important to do this right than to do it fast. We are the world’s reserve currency. And I think we’re in a good place to make that analysis and make that decision—by the way, which will be a governmentwide decision. We would do this, we would have to have a meeting of the minds with the Administration and also probably with Congress. We would really like to have broad support for this. It’s a very important innovation. And I think we would need that to go ahead, and that’s the process we’re engaged in. Thanks very much.","Q&A","Press Conf","","129","2021-09"
"2021-09-22","So, no, I was not aware of the specifics of what they were doing. So let me just say a couple things about this subject. We understand very well that the trust of the American people is essential for us to effectively carry out our mission. And that’s why I directed the Fed to begin a comprehensive review of the ethics rules around permissible financial holdings and activity by Fed officials. So those rules are, in many respects, the same as those for government agencies, plus a number of things that apply specifically to us because of our business. Secondly, there are times when we’re not allowed to trade at all or to, you know, buy and sell financial assets. And that’s the period immediately before and during an FOMC meeting. And, third, there’s regular disclosure. So all of these—everyone’s, you know, ownership and activities are all disclosed on an annual basis. So, you know, I would have had to go back and read people’s financial disclosures to know what their activities have been. This has been our framework for a long time, and I guess you’d say it’s served us well. The other thing you would say—that it is now clearly seen as not adequate to the task of really sustaining the public’s trust in us. We need to make changes, and we’re going to do that as a consequence of this. This will be a thoroughgoing and comprehensive review. We’re going to gather all the facts and look at ways to further tighten our rules and standards.","Q&A","Press Conf","","259","2021-09"
"2021-09-22","Well, so, again, substantial further progress toward our goals is the test for beginning the taper. And the taper takes some months in everyone’s figuring. So you’re going to be well away from satisfying the liftoff test when we begin the taper. So in terms of the liftoff test, though, you know, it’s what we adopted last September. It’s labor market conditions consistent with maximum employment. And while we have interesting signs that, in many ways, the labor market’s very tight, we also have lots of slack in the labor market, and we think that those imbalances will sort themself out. Inflation at 2 percent and on track to achieve it, that test by the time we reach liftoff. So I just think, if you look at what people are writing down for year-end 2022 numbers, some people are writing down very low unemployment rates. And that’s only one indicator, but it suggests a very strong labor market. And I think they’re writing down in good faith what they see as meeting the test. There’s a range of perspectives about where the economy will be, but— by the way, all but one participants have us lifting off during 2023. So it’s not really an unusually wide array of views about this.","Q&A","Press Conf","","211","2021-09"
"2021-09-22","So let me say that there’s very broad support on the Committee for this plan, both as to the timing and as to the pace of the taper. So this was a unanimous vote today, and I’d say quite broad support for this approach. You’re correct that there are some who would prefer to have gone sooner, and they’ve made their arguments publicly. For some of them, it’s a financial stability concern. And for others, it’s other concerns. They can make their own arguments. This is an approach that the Committee will broadly support, and it will put us having completed our taper sometime around the middle of next year, which seems appropriate. other markets. Then, as the recovery got going, they supported aggregate demand, as they will do. And now we’re in a situation where they still have a use, but it’s time for us to begin to taper them. Their usefulness is much less as a tool than it was at the very beginning. And, of course, this leaves the whole question of rate increases ahead, which is really where the framework—the framework is all about how we deal with rate increases and that sort of thing. So we think this is the appropriate way to go. And, again, broad support on the Committee.","Q&A","Press Conf","","216","2021-09"
"2021-09-22","Sure. So, as you can see, the inflation forecasts have moved up a bit in the outyears. And that’s really, I think, a reflection of—and they’ve moved up significantly for this year. And that’s, I think, a reflection of the fact that the bottlenecks and shortages that are being—that we’re seeing in the economy have really not begun to abate in a meaningful way yet. So those seem to be going to be with us at least for a few more months and perhaps into next year. So that suggests that inflation’s going to be higher this year, and a number—I guess the inflation rates for next year and 2023 were also marked up, but just by a couple of tenths. Why—those are very modest overshoots. You’re looking at 2.2 and 2.1, you know, two years You know, we want to foster a strong labor market, and we want to foster inflation averaging 2 percent over time, and I think we’re very much on track to achieve those things. In terms of the framework, I see this as very consistent with the framework. We want inflation expectations to be anchored at around 2 percent. We want, we’re—that’s really the ultimate test of whether we’re getting this done under the framework. And, you know, we do want inflation to run moderately above 2 percent. I wouldn’t put too much on a couple of tenths over 2 percent in 2023 and ’24—one-tenth in ’24. But you’re right, those are the numbers.","Q&A","Press Conf","","249","2021-09"
"2021-09-22","Sure. So the test for beginning our taper is that we’ve achieved substantial further progress toward our goals of [2 percent] inflation and maximum employment. And for inflation, we appear to have achieved more than significant progress—substantial further progress. So that part of the test is achieved, in my view and in the view of many others. So the question is really on the maximum-employment test. So if you look at a good number of indicators, you will see that, since last December, when we articulated the test, and the readings today, in many cases more than half of the distance, for example, between the unemployment rate in December of 2020 and typical estimates of the natural rate—50 or 60 percent of that road has been traveled. So that could be substantial further progress. range of perspectives. I guess my own view would be that the test—the “substantial further progress” test for employment is all but met. And so, once we’ve met those two tests, once the Committee decides that they’ve met [them]—and that could come as soon as the next meeting; that’s the purpose of that language, is to put notice out that that could come as soon as the next meeting. The Committee will consider that test, and we’ll also look at the broader environment at that time and make a decision whether to taper.","Q&A","Press Conf","","227","2021-09"
"2021-09-22","Good afternoon. At the Federal Reserve, we are strongly committed to achieving the monetary policy goals that Congress has given us: maximum employment and price stability. Today, the Federal Open Market Committee kept interest rates near zero and maintained our current pace of asset purchases. These measures, along with our strong guidance on interest rates and on our balance sheet, will ensure that monetary policy will continue to support the economy until the recovery is complete. Progress on vaccinations and unprecedented fiscal policy actions are also providing strong support to the recovery. Indicators of economic activity and employment have continued to strengthen. Real GDP rose at a robust 6.4 percent pace in the first half of the year, and growth is widely expected to continue at a strong pace in the second half. The sectors most adversely affected by the pandemic have improved in recent months, but the rise in COVID-19 cases has slowed their recovery. Household spending rose at an especially rapid pace over the first half of the year but flattened out in July and August as spending softened in COVID-sensitive sectors, such as travel and restaurants. Additionally, in some industries, near-term supply constraints are restraining activity. These constraints are particularly acute in the motor vehicle industry, where the worldwide shortage of semiconductors has sharply curtailed production. Partly reflecting the effects of the virus and supply constraints, forecasts from FOMC participants for economic growth this year have been revised somewhat lower since our June Summary of Economic Projections, but participants still foresee rapid growth. past three months. In August, however, job gains slowed markedly, with the slowdown concentrated in sectors most sensitive to the pandemic, including leisure and hospitality. The unemployment rate was 5.2 percent in August, and this figure understates the shortfall in employment, particularly as participation in the labor market has not moved up from the low rates that have prevailed for most of the past year. Factors related to the pandemic, such as caregiving needs and ongoing fears of the virus, appear to be weighing on employment growth. These factors should diminish with progress on containing the virus, leading to more rapid gains in employment. Looking ahead, FOMC participants project the labor market to continue to improve, with the median projection for the unemployment rate standing at 4.8 percent at the end of this year and 3.5 percent in 2023 and ’24. The economic downturn has not fallen equally on all Americans, and those least able to shoulder the burden have been hardest hit. In particular, despite progress, joblessness continues to fall disproportionately on lower-wage workers in the service sector and on African Americans and Hispanics. Inflation is elevated and will likely remain so in coming months before moderating. As the economy continues to reopen and spending rebounds, we are seeing upward pressure on prices, particularly because supply bottlenecks in some sectors have limited how quickly production can respond in the near term. These bottleneck effects have been larger and longer lasting than anticipated, leading to upward revisions to participants’ inflation projections for this year. While these supply effects are prominent for now, they will abate, and as they do, inflation The process of reopening the economy is unprecedented, as was the shutdown at the onset of the pandemic. As the reopening continues, bottlenecks, hiring difficulties, and other constraints could again prove to be greater and longer lasting than anticipated, posing upside risks to inflation. Our framework for monetary policy emphasizes the importance of having well-anchored inflation expectations, both to foster price stability and to enhance our ability to promote our broad-based and inclusive maximum-employment goal. Indicators of longer-term inflation expectations appear broadly consistent with our longer-run inflation goal of 2 percent. If sustained higher inflation were to become a serious concern, we would certainly respond and use our tools to assure that inflation runs at levels that are consistent with our goal. The path of the economy continues to depend on the course of the virus, and risks to the economic outlook remain. The Delta variant has led to significant increases in COVID-19 cases, resulting in significant hardship and loss and slowing the economic recovery. Continued progress on vaccinations would help contain the virus and support a return to more normal economic conditions. The Fed’s policy actions have been guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people, along with our responsibilities to promote the stability of the financial system. Our asset purchases have been a critical tool. They helped preserve financial stability and market functioning early in the pandemic and since then have helped foster accommodative financial conditions to support the economy. At our meeting that concluded earlier today, the Committee continued to discuss the progress made toward our goals since the Committee adopted its asset purchase guidance last purchases may soon be warranted. We also discussed the appropriate pace of tapering asset purchases once economic conditions satisfy the criterion laid out in the Committee’s guidance. While no decisions were made, participants generally view that, so long as the recovery remains on track, a gradual tapering process that concludes around the middle of next year is likely to be appropriate. Even after our balance sheet stops expanding, our elevated holdings of longer-term securities will continue to support accommodative financial conditions. The timing and pace of the coming reduction in asset purchases will not be intended to carry a direct signal regarding the timing of interest rate liftoff, for which we have articulated a different and substantially more stringent test. We continue to expect that it will be appropriate to maintain the current 0 to ¼ percent target range for the federal funds rate until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee’s assessment of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time. Half of FOMC participants forecast that these favorable economic conditions will be fulfilled by the end of next year; as a result, the median projection for the appropriate level of the federal funds rate lies slightly above the effective lower bound in 2022. Participants generally expect a gradual pace of policy firming that would leave the level of the federal funds rate below estimates of its longer-run level through 2024. Of course, these projections do not represent a Committee decision or plan, and no one knows with any certainty where the economy will be a year or more from now. More important than any forecast is the To conclude, we understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission. We at the Fed will do everything we can to support the economy for as long as it takes to complete the recovery.

"2021-09-22","So, you’re right, we have a—really, I’ll call it a unique situation where, by many measures, the labor market is tight. And 11 million job openings, very widespread reports from employers all over the economy saying it’s quite difficult to hire people, wages moving up, and that kind—so, quite a tight labor market. So our view, I think— widespread view a few months ago was that several things were coming together in the fall, including kids back to school, which would, you know, which would lighten caregiving duties, including the expiration of unemployment—extra unemployment benefits, and other things would come together to provide an increase in labor supply, and so we’d get out of this strange world where there’re lots of unemployed people and a high unemployment rate but a labor shortage. or when they’re always at a threat of being closed because of Delta, the Delta variant, you know, you might want to wait. Rather than going ahead and taking a job and starting work only to have to quit it three weeks later, you’re going to wait until you’re confident of that. So some of that may not have happened. Also, people didn’t, you know—as you know, hiring and spending in these face-to-face service industries, travel and leisure, it just kind of stopped during those months. So we—so that—really, the big shortfall in labor, in jobs, was largely in travel and leisure, and that’s because of—clearly because of Delta. So that all happened. And so what we—we know things that didn’t happen. I think there’s still—it may just be that it’s going to take more time. But it still seems that, inexorably, people will—these are people who were largely working back in February of 2020. They’ll get back to work when it’s time to do that. It just may take a longer time. You’re right, though—it didn’t happen with any force in September, and a lot of that was Delta. In terms of the—you asked also about the test for November. I think if the economy continues to progress broadly in line with expectations, then I think—and also the overall situation is appropriate for this, then I think we could easily move ahead at the next meeting.

We have not focused on whether we meet the liftoff test, because we don’t meet the liftoff test now because we’re not at maximum employment. What I’m saying is, given where inflation is and where it’s projected to be, let’s say we do meet the maximum-employment test. Then the Committee—the question for the Committee at that time will be, has the inflation test been met? And, you know, I don’t want to get ahead of the Committee on that, but the answer may very well be “Yes, it’s been met.” But we’re not asking that question today, because we’re not running a liftoff test. We’re not evaluating the liftoff test today. We didn’t have that discussion at today’s meeting. We did talk about the economy and the development of the economy, but we didn’t ask ourselves whether the liftoff test is met, because, you know, it’s clearly not met on the maximum-employment side.","Q&A","Press Conf","","189","2021-11"
"2021-11-03","So wages have been moving up strongly, very strongly. And, in particular, I would point to the employment compensation index reading that we got last Friday. Now, in real terms, they’ve been—they had been running a little bit below inflation, so real wages were not really increasing. I think, with the ECI reading, it becomes close to maybe not increasing, but close to back to zero in terms of the real increase. So wages moving up, of course, is how standard of living increases over the years for generation upon generation. It’s very important, and it’s generally a good thing. You know, the concern is a somewhat unusual case where, if wages were to be rising persistently and materially above inflation and productivity gains, that could put upward pressure on, or downward pressure on margins and cause companies to—or employers, really—to raise prices as a result, and you can see yourself, find yourself in what we used to call a wage–price spiral. We don’t have evidence of that yet. Productivity has been very high. The ECI reading is just one reading. Again, if you look back, carefully.","Q&A","Press Conf","","187","2021-11"
"2021-11-03","Good afternoon. At the Federal Reserve, we are strongly committed to achieving the monetary policy goals that Congress has given us: maximum employment and price stability. Today, the FOMC kept interest rates near zero and, in light of the progress the economy has made toward our goals, decided to begin reducing the pace of asset purchases. With these actions, monetary policy will continue to provide strong support to the economic recovery. Given the unprecedented nature of the disruptions related to the pandemic and the reopening of the economy, we remain attentive to risks and will ensure that our policy is well positioned to address the full range of plausible economic outcomes. I will say more about our monetary policy decisions after reviewing recent economic developments. Economic activity expanded at a 6.5 percent pace in the first half of the year, reflecting progress on vaccinations, the reopening of the economy, and strong policy support. In the third quarter, real GDP growth slowed notably from this rapid pace. The summer’s surge in COVID cases from the Delta variant has held back the recovery in the sectors most adversely affected by the pandemic, including travel and leisure. Activity has also been restrained by supply constraints and bottlenecks, notably in the motor vehicle industry. As a result, both household spending and business investment flattened out last quarter. Nonetheless, aggregate demand has been very strong this year, buoyed by fiscal and monetary policy support and the healthy financial positions of households and businesses. With COVID case counts receding further and progress on vaccinations, economic growth should pick up this quarter, resulting in strong growth for the year as a whole. the rise in COVID cases. In August and September, job gains averaged 280,000 per month, down from an average of about 1 million jobs per month in June and July. The slowdown has been concentrated in sectors most sensitive to the pandemic, including leisure and hospitality and education. The unemployment rate was 4.8 percent in September. This figure understates the shortfall in employment, particularly as participation in the labor market remains subdued. Some of the softness in participation likely reflects the aging of the population and retirements. But participation for prime-aged individuals also remains well below pre-pandemic levels—in part reflecting factors related to the pandemic, such as caregiving needs and ongoing concerns about the virus. As a result, employers are having difficulties filling job openings. These impediments to labor supply should diminish with further progress on containing the virus—supporting gains in employment and economic activity. The economic downturn has not fallen equally on all Americans, and those least able to shoulder the burden have been hardest hit. Despite progress, joblessness continues to fall disproportionately on African Americans and Hispanics. The supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic and the reopening of the economy have contributed to sizable price increases in some sectors. In particular, bottlenecks and supply chain disruptions are limiting how quickly production can respond to the rebound in demand in the near term. As a result, overall inflation is running well above our 2 percent longer-run goal. Supply constraints have been larger and longer lasting than anticipated. Nonetheless, it remains the case that the drivers of higher inflation have been predominantly We understand the difficulties that high inflation poses for individuals and families, particularly those with limited means to absorb higher prices for essentials such as food and transportation. Our tools cannot ease supply constraints. Like most forecasters, we continue to believe that our dynamic economy will adjust to the supply and demand imbalances and that, as it does, inflation will decline to levels much closer to our 2 percent longer-run goal. Of course, it is very difficult to predict the persistence of supply constraints or their effects on inflation. Global supply chains are complex; they will return to normal function, but the timing of that is highly uncertain. We are committed to our longer-run goal of 2 percent inflation and to having longer-term inflation expectations well anchored at this goal. If we were to see signs that the path of inflation, or [of] longer-term inflation expectations, was moving materially and persistently beyond levels consistent with our goal, we would use our tools to preserve price stability. We will be watching carefully to see whether the economy is evolving in line with expectations. The Fed’s policy actions have been guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people, along with our responsibilities to promote the stability of the financial system. Our asset purchases have been a critical tool. They helped preserve financial stability early in the pandemic and since then have helped foster smooth market functioning and accommodative financial conditions to support the economy. Last December, the Committee stated its intention to continue asset purchases at a pace of at least $120 billion per month until substantial further progress has been made toward our Beginning later this month, we will reduce the monthly pace of our net asset purchases by $10 billion for Treasury securities and $5 billion for agency mortgage-backed securities. We also announced another reduction of this size in the monthly purchase pace starting in mid- December, since that month’s purchase schedule will be released by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York prior to our December FOMC meeting. If the economy evolves broadly as expected, we judge that similar reductions in the pace of net asset purchases will likely be appropriate each month, implying that increases in our securities holdings would cease by the middle of next year. That said, we are prepared to adjust the pace of purchases if warranted by changes in the economic outlook. And even after our balance sheet stops expanding, our holdings of securities will continue to support accommodative financial conditions. Our decision today to begin tapering our asset purchases does not imply any direct signal regarding our interest rate policy. We continue to articulate a different and more stringent test for the economic conditions that would need to be met before raising the federal funds rate. To conclude, we understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission. We at the Fed will do everything we can to complete the recovery in employment and achieve our price-stability goal. Thank you.","Opening Statement","Press Conf","","1056","2021-11"

"2021-11-03","Yes. So, what’s happening is, people are leaving their jobs. They’re quitting their jobs in all-time-high numbers—but, in many cases, going back into employment and getting higher wages. So a lot of the higher wages you’re seeing are for job switchers rather than incumbents. So that’s just, that’s a sign of a really strong labor market, as opposed to people just running off and quitting. There have also been—there are a significant number of retirements, and we’ll just have to see what that means. So, toward the end of the last cycle, which was the longest in our recorded economic history, we did see labor force participation moving up well above what economists estimate was the trend, and part of that was people staying in the labor force or just not retiring at the rates they were expected to retire. So maybe this was just catch-up on that. I am a believer that, over time, you won’t know how far—you won’t know what can happen with labor force participation in advance. You’re just going to have to give it some time, because we saw that over and over again. There are things that we can, where we can say, you know, this is where the limit is. Labor force participation is a much more flexible subject for me, and so I do think we need to be So in terms of full employment, as I discussed earlier, I think, at the very beginning of the recovery, the natural thing to do was to look back at labor conditions, labor market conditions in February of 2010, at the end of the longest expansion in our history. There was so much to like about that labor market, a really historically good labor market—never perfect, but a good labor market. We’re in a different world now. This is a—it’s just very different. The pandemic recession was the deepest, and the recovery has been the fastest. And wages didn’t really go down. And, you know, real incomes were more than fully replaced by fiscal policy [support]. All of this is completely unusual. You know, an economy where inflation was driven by services is now inflation where—all the inflation is in goods, which have had negative inflation for a quarter-century. So you ask about full employment. I think we have to—I’m very open to the thought that it’s going to be an empirical question of where it is located, and we’re just going to learn more and more. I mean, one thing we’ll learn, I think, I hope we’ll learn in the next, in the near term is, once the Delta variant really does continue to decline, what’s going to happen to employment? Are we going to start to see over the winter, you know, significant increases in jobs again? If you look back, the three-, six-, and nine-month average job creation is between 550,000 and 600,000. So if you think of that as a stronger—you don’t have to think back to the million-job months of June and July. You can just think, okay, 550 to 600—if we should get back on that path, then we would be making good progress, and we like to see that, of course. So","Q&A","Press Conf","","535","2021-11"

"2021-11-03","So I don’t have anything for you on supplemental leverage ratio right now. We are looking at ways to, if there are ways we can address liquidity issues through that channel. We’re also—we also have a—there’s a working group headed by [the] Treasury about, over Treasury [securities] markets, and what happened in the acute phase of the pandemic, and what structural things may need to be done. So that would be part of that workstream, and I know that there’s a lot going on. I’m not sure when that report will be out. So it’s work under way. That’s one of the many issues that are part of that, along with things like central clearing of Treasuries, greater central clearing, and, you know, many other ideas. It’s important that we have a liquid Treasury [securities] market. It’s a huge public benefit that we do, and, you know, I think we need to do those things that enable that, you know, while also assuring the safety and soundness of our largest financial institutions, who tend to be the main dealers. So we have to make sure that that’s always a first order of concern as well.","Q&A","Press Conf","","195","2021-11"
"2021-11-03","I will say, though, that I have briefed Administration officials, and I’ve briefed people on Capitol Hill in detail about what we did and why we did it, and seeking their feedback, getting their reaction. But, you know, this is—part of my job is—Congress has oversight over the Fed, and we take that very seriously. So if you’re on our, one of the two committees that has oversight over us, then I’m in regular contact with you, probably. And, you know, when something like this comes up, I’m on the phone. I’m offering to meet with you and explain it to you and answer your questions and identify any concerns people might have. That’s","Q&A","Press Conf","","114","2021-11"

"2021-11-03","Sure. So in terms of the balance sheet, those questions that you mention—we haven’t gone back to them. Now that we’ve tapered, I expect that that’s exactly know, typically, when we’re doing a new subject like that, we’ll have a series of briefings and discussions. And that’s what we will now begin to do. In terms of the effect of asset purchases on the economy, so, there’s a tremendous amount of research and scholarship on this. And, you know, you can kind of—you can find different people coming out with different views. But I would say, the most mainstream view would be that you’re at the effective lower bound, so how do you affect longer-term rates? There are two ways. One, so you can’t lower rates—let’s say you can’t lower rates any further, hypothetically. So you can give forward guidance. You can say, we’re going to keep the rates low for a period of time, either [for] a specific period, [or] until certain conditions are met. The markets will do the math, and that’ll have an effect on longer-term borrowings even, you know, 10, 30 years out kind of thing. So that’s one thing. The other thing you can do is, you just go buy those securities, buy longer-term securities. That will drive down longer-term rates and hold them lower, and, you know, rates right across the, right across the rate spectrum matter for borrowers. So lower rates encourage more borrowing, encourage more economic activity. People—you can service your debt. You have more free cash flow. You know, it’s not different from what we do at the short end. So that was discussed long before anybody did it. That was—I think Milton Friedman said that that was what you could do if you were pinned at the lower bound, many, many years ago. So, anyway, that’s how it’s supposed to work. And, you know, it’s quite hard to be precise about these things because, you know, you only have one economy, and you can’t run two different economies right next to each other and do a scientific experiment. But most people do what we do. More accommodative financial conditions lead to more economic activity, over time, with a lag. So I think that’s the main finding I would say on","Q&A","Press Conf","","380","2021-11"
"2021-11-03","Consequently, the Committee agreed that, beginning with the purchase schedule published in mid-November, it would increase its holdings of Treasury securities by at least $70 billion per month rather than $80 billion per month and would increase its holdings of agency MBS by at least $35 billion per month, rather than $40 billion per month.","Participants' Views","Minutes","N/A","55","2021-11"
"2021-11-03","So we, you know, we—let me just say that this system, the ethics system we had in place had been in place for decades and had, as far as we know, served us well, and then that was no longer the case. And so we had no moment of denial about that. As a group, we stepped in, and we took the actions that we took. And, you know, within one FOMC cycle, we announced a new set of rules to, you know, to try to put us back where we need to be, which is, we need to have the complete trust of the American people that we’re working in their interest all the time—absolutely critical to our work, as it is for any government agency. And I feel like this called that into question. So we reacted, I would characterize it, strongly and forcefully. If there were other things that we could do that were reasonable, we would certainly do them. So you asked me about blind trusts. You know, the overall authority for ethics around these issues in the federal government is the Office of Government Ethics,","Q&A","Press Conf","","190","2021-11"
"2021-11-03","So that’s not a decision for bank regulators or for any agency. That’s a decision for elected representatives. So we feel that any role that we have—and we do think we have a role in climate change. It relates to our existing mandates, and our existing mandates are, really, prudential regulation of financial institutions. We expect them, and the public will expect us to expect them, to understand and be in a position to manage their risks. So that’s physical risk, and it’s transition risk for climate. And, by the way, the large financial institutions are doing this already, and, you know, we think that’s right within our mandate. There’s also a financial stability question, the overall stability of the financial system. And so, from that standpoint, we can do research. We can try to help understand what will the pathways be through which climate change effects the economy—both physical risk and transition risk. That’s what we can do, and that’s what we will do. And we’ll do it well. Within the frame of our existing mandates, we’ll do it well. We’re not the people who will decide the national strategy on climate change. That has to be elected people, and not so much us. We feel like we have that narrow mandate, and we will do it well.","Q&A","Press Conf","","219","2021-11"
"2021-11-03","That’s a decision for the Committee. I would put it to you this way. When we reach maximum employment, when we reach a state where labor market conditions are at maximum employment in the Committee’s judgment, it’s very possible that the inflation test will already be met. We’re aware that that language sounds, it sounds a little out of touch with what’s going on, but, you know, we’re not at maximum employment. When that is the case, we’ll look to see whether the inflation test is met, and there’s a good chance that it will be if you look at how inflation has evolved in the last year and a half. given that, I mean, how should we wonder what “moderately” over and “for some time” mean?","Q&A","Press Conf","","127","2021-11"
"2021-11-03","Yes. So, first of all, it is our job to—and we accept responsibility and accountability for inflation in the medium term. We’re accountable to Congress and to the American people for maximum employment and price stability. The level of inflation we have right now is not at all consistent with price stability. By the way, we’re also not at maximum employment, as I mentioned. So I would want to assure people that we will use our tools as appropriate to get inflation under control. We don’t think it’s a good time to raise interest rates, though, because we want to see the labor market heal further. And we have very good reason to think that that will happen as the Delta variant declines, so—which it’s doing now. So “transitory” is a word that people have had different understandings of. For some, it carries a sense of “short lived,” and that’s, you know, there’s a real time component—measured in months, let’s say. Really, for us, what “transitory” has meant is that if something is transitory, it will not leave behind it permanently or very persistently higher inflation. So that’s why we, you know, we took a step back from “transitory.” We said “expected to be transitory,” first of all, to show uncertainty around that—we’ve always said that, by the way, in other contexts; we just hadn’t done it in the statement—but also to acknowledge, really, that it means different things to different people. And then we added some language to really explain more what we’re talking about in paragraph two and paragraph three. We said that “supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic and the reopening of the economy have contributed to sizable price increases,” and we said, “Progress on vaccinations and an easing of supply constraints are expected to support continued gains in So it’s, I mean, it’s become a word that’s attracted a lot of attention that maybe is distracting from our message, which we want to be as clear as possible. Ultimately, the only other thing I would say is, look, we understand completely that it’s particularly people who are living paycheck to paycheck or seeing higher grocery costs, higher gasoline costs—when the winter comes, higher heating costs for their homes. We understand completely what they’re going through. And, you know, we will use our tools over time to make sure that that doesn’t become a permanent feature of life. Really, that’s one of our principal jobs, along with achieving maximum employment. And that’s our commitment.","Q&A","Press Conf","","419","2021-11"
"2021-11-03","You know, I would just leave you with the words we have here. We are prepared to speed up or slow down the pace of reductions in asset purchases if it’s warranted by changes in the economic outlook. And, again, if we feel like something like that’s happening, then we’ll be very transparent about it. We wouldn’t want to surprise markets. We’ll say, in light of this factor or these factors, we are considering doing this, and then we would either do it or not do it. But so—but I’m not going to, you know, start making up examples of what that might be today. Thanks.","Q&A","Press Conf","","106","2021-11"
"2021-11-03","Yes, so, you know, this isn’t the traditional Phillips curve situation where there’s a direct tradeoff, where that’s really what we’re talking about. The inflation that situation where you have that precise tradeoff. But, you know, in this situation, we do have a provision in our Statement on Longer-Run Goals, as you know, that says when those two things are in tension, what we do is, we take into account the employment shortfalls and inflation deviations and the potentially different time horizons over which employment and inflation are projected to return to levels judged consistent with the mandate. So we used to call that the “balanced approach” paragraph. We have to think about the amount of the deviation, we have to think about the time it will take, and we have to make policy in a world where the two goals are in tension. It’s very difficult. But what it really boils down to is something that’s common sense. And that is risk management. We have to be aware of the risks that we’re—particularly now the risk of significantly higher inflation. We see shortages and bottlenecks persisting into next year, well into next year. We see higher inflation persisting, and we have to be in position to address that risk should it become really a threat to—should it create a threat of more persistent, longer-term inflation. And that’s what we think our policy is doing now. It’s putting us in a position to be able to address the range of plausible outcomes.","Q&A","Press Conf","","252","2021-11"
"2021-11-03","Well, so, let me say what’s happened—and we’re very, very straightforward about it—is that inflation has come in higher than expected, and bottlenecks have been more persistent and more prevalent. We see that just like everybody else does, and we see that they’re now on track to persist well into next year. That was not expected—not expected by us, not expected by other macro forecasters. Now, let me say, you know, it’s difficult enough to just forecast the economy in normal times. When you’re talking about, you know, global supply chains in turmoil, it’s a whole different thing. And you’re talking about a pandemic that’s holding people out of the labor force for reasons that we can sample, but we don’t have a lot of experience with this. So it’s very, very difficult to forecast and not easy to set policy. So we have to set policy, though. So that’s what we’re doing. And, you know, so, to look at your question this way, I don’t think that we’re behind the curve. I actually believe that policy is well positioned to address the range of plausible today. And the reason is that there’s still ground to cover to get to maximum employment. And we don’t want to stop that when there’s good reason to think—there’s still good reason to think, although it’s been delayed, clearly, there’s good reason to think that the economy will reopen, particularly if we do get past, you know, significant outbreaks of","Q&A","Press Conf","","246","2021-11"

"2021-12-15","So maximum employment, if you look at our Statement on Longer- Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, maximum employment is something that we look at a broad range of indicators. And those would include, of course, things like the unemployment rate, the labor force participation rate, job openings, wages, flows in and out of the labor force in various parts of the labor force. We’d also tend to look broadly and inclusively at different demographic groups and not just at the headline and aggregate numbers. So that’s a—that’s a judgment for the Committee to make. The Committee will make a judgment that we’ve achieved labor market conditions consistent with maximum employment when it makes that—it is, admittedly, a judgment call because it’s a range of factors. Unlike inflation, where we have one number that sort of dominates, it’s a broad range of things. So, as I mentioned in my opening remarks, in my view, we are making rapid progress toward maximum employment. And you see that, of course, in some of the factors that I mentioned.","Q&A","Press Conf","","176","2021-12"
"2021-12-15","So, on the first part of your question, which is, “Why not stop purchasing now?,” I would just say this: We’ve learned that, in dealing with balance sheet issues, we’ve learned that it’s best to take a careful sort of methodical approach to make adjustments. Markets can be sensitive to it. And we thought that this was—this was a doubling of the speed. We’re basically two meetings away now from finishing the taper. And we thought that was the appropriate way to go. So we announced it, and that’s what will happen. You know, the question of long and variable lags is, is an interesting one. That’s, that’s Milton Friedman’s famous statement. And I do think that in this world, where everything is— where the global financial markets are connected together, financial conditions can change very quickly. And my own sense is that they get into—financial conditions affect the economy fairly rapidly, longer than the traditional thought of, you know, a year or 18 months. Shorter than that, rather. But in addition, when we communicate about what we’re going to do, the markets move immediately [in response] to that. So financial conditions are changing to reflect, you know, the forecasts that we made and basically, which was, I think, fairly in line with what markets were expecting. But financial conditions don’t wait to change until, until things actually happen. They, they change on the expectation of things happening. So I don’t think it’s a question of having to wait.","Q&A","Press Conf","","249","2021-12"
"2021-12-15","So we, we haven’t made any decision of that nature. And so, no, I wouldn’t say that’s our position at all. We really haven’t taken a position on that. I will say that we did talk today–We had our first discussion about the balance sheet, for example. And we went through the way—the sequence of events regarding the runoff and that sort of thing with the balance sheet, last time. And I think people thought that was an interesting discussion. They thought that it was informative, but people pointed out that this is a significantly different economic situation that we have at the current time, and that those—the differences that we see now would tend to influence how we think about the balance sheet. And the same thing would be true about raising rates. I don’t—I don’t foresee that there would be that kind of very employment. Inflation is running well above target, and growth is well above potential. There wouldn’t be the need for that kind of long delay. Having said that, I—you know, we’ll make this decision in coming meetings, and it’s not—it’s not a decision that the Committee has really focused on yet.","Q&A","Press Conf","","196","2021-12"
"2021-12-15","Right. So the—you know, the thing is, we’re not going back to the same economy we had in February of 2020. And I think early on, that was—the sense was that that’s where we were headed. The post-pandemic labor market, and the economy in general, will be different. And the maximum level of employment that’s consistent with price stability evolves over time within a—within a business cycle and over a longer period, in part reflecting [the] evolution of the factors that affect labor supply, including those related to the pandemic. So I would say: Look, we’re, we’re at 4.2 percent now and it’s been—the unemployment rate has been dropping very quickly. So we’re already in the vicinity of 4 percent. that, last fall, as unemployment insurance ran off, as vaccinations increased, [and] as schools reopened, that we would see a significant surge, if you will, or at least a surge, in labor force participation. So we’ve begun to see some improvement. We certainly welcome the 2/10 improvement that we got in the November report. But I do think that it’s—it feels likely now that the return to higher participation is going to take longer. And, in fact, that’s, that’s been the pattern in past cycles—that labor force participation has tended to recover in the wake of a strong recovery in unemployment, which is what we’re getting right now. So you—it could well have been that this cycle was different because of the short nature of it and the very strong—the number of job openings, for example, you would have thought that that would have pulled people back in. But, really, it’s the pandemic, it’s a range of factors. But the reality is, we don’t have a strong labor force participation recovery yet, and we may not have it for some time. At the same time, we have to make policy now. And inflation is well above target. So this is something we need to take into—take into account.","Q&A","Press Conf","","328","2021-12"
"2021-12-15","So this is—this is not at all a decision that the Committee has made. But you’re really asking a question about how our framework works. And, yes, there is a— there’s a provision, it used to be called the “balanced approach” provision, that says, in effect, that in situations in which the pursuit of the maximum-employment goal and [the pursuit of] the which could, in concept, be taken and it’s in our framework, it’s been in our framework a long time. I’ve talked about it on a number of occasions. It, it is a provision that would enable us to, in this case, because of high inflation, move before achieving maximum employment. Now, we’re—as I said, we’re making rapid progress toward maximum employment in my—in my thinking, in my opinion. And I don’t at all know that we will—that we’ll have to invoke that, that paragraph. But just as a factual matter, that is part of our framework—and has been, really, for a very long time.","Q&A","Press Conf","","166","2021-12"
"2021-12-15","Well, I think there’s a lot of uncertainty, which is why we—why we called it out in our statement, our postmeeting statement, as a risk. It’s—we, we follow the same experts and I—we, we talk privately to the same experts that everyone else does and read the same articles in the paper and the same research and, you know, so the—you mentioned the early assessment is highly transmissible, perhaps not as severe, some continuing protection from, from States and replace Delta as the dominant variant fairly quickly. That could easily happen. I think there’s another step there, though—which is what’s going to be the effect on the economy. And that will depend, you know, on how much it suppresses demand as opposed to suppressing supply. It is not clear how big the effects would be on either inflation or growth or hiring on top of what’s already going on, which is quite a strong, you know, wave of Delta that’s hitting large parts of the country across the northern United States and all the way to the eastern seaboard and now coming down. We’re having quite a wave of Delta. So coming in on top of that, again, it’s very difficult to say what the economic effects would be. I do think, wave upon wave, people are learning to live with this. More and more people are getting vaccinated. So [vaccinated] people who get the new variant, it affects them much less than it tends to affect, in the aggregate, people who are not vaccinated. So the more people get vaccinated, the less the economic effect. It doesn’t mean it won’t have an economic effect. Delta had an effect of slowing down hiring. And it actually—it had an effect on global supply chains. And that sort of—that hurt the process of the global supply chains getting worked out. So it can have an economic effect. I just think, at this point, we don’t know much. We’ll know a whole lot more in three weeks, and we’ll know more than that in six weeks.","Q&A","Press Conf","","343","2021-12"
"2021-12-15","Sure. So I guess I would go back and—you know, it’s been a continual process, really. Inflation really popped up, right? In the late spring last year. And we had a view—it was very, very widely held in the forecasting community—that this would be temporary. It was quite narrow, you know, a limited number of factors were causing it. And there was a decent amount of evidence to support that view, that it would be temporary or transitory, as we said. Certainly, we had five months of declining month on month—monthly readings of inflation, but we didn’t see much in the way of progress on labor supply or on other supply-side issues. Then in September, I’d say after Labor Day, we started to see—it started to become clear that this was both larger in its effect on inflation and more persistent. And, of course, I said so on many occasions, and one of the consequences of that is that we move the taper forward. We moved the taper forward and we—and it’s a much faster taper than had been planned. So we’ve been adapting—I’ve been saying we’re adapting our policy. reading for the employment compensation index for the third quarter, not annualized, for the third quarter, just before the meeting. And I thought for a second there whether we—whether we should increase our taper, [We] decided to go ahead with what we had—what we had “socialized.” Then, right after that, we got the next Friday after the meeting, two days after the meeting, we got a very strong employment report and, you know, revisions to prior readings and, and no increase in labor supply. And the Friday after that, we got the CPI, which was a very hot, high reading. And I, honestly, at that point, really decided that I thought we needed to—we needed to look at, at speeding up the taper. And we went to work on that. So that’s, that’s really what happened. It was essentially higher inflation and faster—turns out much faster progress in the labor market. Really, what’s happening is the unemployment rate is catching up—seems to be catching up—with a lot of the other readings of a tight labor market, 6/10 [decline] over one cycle. So that’s really what happened and, you know, widely supported in the Committee today, as you can see—unanimous vote—but beyond that I think widely, widely supported, you know, this, this move.","Q&A","Press Conf","","402","2021-12"
"2021-12-15","Right. So—but I said—you, you quoted me correctly. It’s, it’s—so far, we don’t see—wages are not a big part of the high-inflation story that we’re seeing. As you look forward, let’s assume that the goods economy does sort itself out, and supply chains get particular—we don’t see this yet, but if you had something where wages were persistently— [increases in] real wages were persistently above productivity growth, that puts upward pressure on, on firms, and they raise prices. It would take something that was persistent and material for that to happen. And we don’t see that yet. But with the kind of hot labor market readings— wages we’re seeing, it’s something that we’re—that we’re watching. And the other thing, of course, is, is rents, which are very important. You know, owners’ equivalent rent. That’s another thing which is very economically sensitive. Unlike the things that are causing the inflation now, this is economically sensitive—and so would be expected to move up. And so as the—as some things go down, the question is: Where will we be when we come out the other side of this? And we need to keep our eyes on those things.","Q&A","Press Conf","","195","2021-12"
"2021-12-15","Yes. I mean, I—absolutely. I, I think—well, whether or not we— whether or not we say “we’re at conditions—labor market conditions consistent with, with maximum employment” next year, we would all be open and I think expect, over time, that the level of maximum employment that’s consistent with price stability would increase further over time—for example, through increasing participation. So I—we would certainly—we would not, in any way, want to foreclose the idea that the labor market can get even better. But, again, with inflation as high as it is, we have to make policy in real time. We’ve got to make that assessment in real time.","Q&A","Press Conf","","107","2021-12"
"2021-12-15","Well, the labor market is, by so many measures, hotter than it ever ran in the last—in the last expansion, if you think about it. You know, the ratio of job openings, for example, to, to vacancies is at all-time highs. Quits, the wages—all those things are, are even hotter. But what would it take for labor force participation to move up more? You know, that’s—really, “Why is it low?” is the question. So there, there are a bunch of answers, and all of them probably have some, you know, some validity. Part of it will be that people—for certain people, they don’t want to go back in the labor force because either they’re medically vulnerable or they’re not comfortable going back while COVID is still everywhere. That’s one thing. The lack of availability of childcare made for caretakers is certainly part of it—not just for children, but for older people. It has been pointed out by many that the stock market is high, people’s portfolios are stronger—they may go back to being a one-income rather than a two-income family. The same thing with people’s houses. People buy—they have a mortgage, you know, with leverage, and the house price increases, the equity they have in their home might have doubled. And they might make—reach the same conclusion. So they’re—and people have savings on their balance sheet because of forced savings because they couldn’t spend on travel and things like that and also because of, you know, because of government transfers. So, for all of those reasons—and it’s hard to know exactly the part each of them plays— we, we have a situation where we’ve had a shock to labor force participation that is not unwinding as quickly as, as many, as expected. And people—in effect, a good part of it is voluntary. You know, people—and this is how they want to maximize their welfare and that’s, that’s their, certainly their choice. In other cases, it’s something that will abate very quickly if their new life and they lose contact with their old jobs. That’s, that’s what the evidence would say. So it’s a range of things. It isn’t that the economy lacks stimulus. You know, usually, in every other expansion, it’s that there aren’t enough jobs and people can’t find jobs and, you know, we’re stimulating demand and trying to get demand to come up. That’s not the problem here. The problem is a supply-side problem, which—what it would take to work it out, I think it’s going to be time. And the number-one thing would, would really be to have the pandemic get under control. That’s what everyone would really like to see: What does the labor force— what does the labor market look like in a world without COVID? That would be the thing that we’d really like to see but, you know, it doesn’t look like that’s coming anytime soon.","Q&A","Press Conf","","483","2021-12"
"2021-12-15","So, actually, I’m looking at the SEP here, and the median forecasts for core and headline inflation did move up by 4/10 each. So that’s a significant—you know, in an SEP, that’s a pretty significant move up. You know, it’s, it’s based on both of those things, I suppose. I do think there’s a broad expectation among forecasters, including our own, that the bottlenecks will alleviate sometime over the course of this year. If you look at where Blue Chip forecasts are—which is, you know, a group of well-resourced, large forecasting operations with a I would say, though, as well that our policy should begin to have an effect. There will be a lag, but it should begin to have an effect on that as well. And, you know, that’s the most likely case. I guess what—the thing I would want to say, though, is we can’t act as though that’s a certainty, and we’re not going to act as though that’s a certainty. There’s a real risk now, we believe, I believe, that inflation may be more persistent and that may be putting inflation expectations under pressure, and that the risk of higher inflation becoming entrenched has increased. It’s certainly increased. I don’t think it’s high at this moment, but I think it’s increased. And I think that’s part of the reason behind our move today. [It] is to put ourselves in a position to be able to deal with that risk. And I think we are in a position to deal with that risk. We need to see more data. We need to see how the inflation data and the—all the data evolve in coming months, but we are prepared to, you know, to use our tools to make sure that higher inflation doesn’t get entrenched. For one reason, as I—as I just mentioned, it’s one of the two big threats, the other being the pandemic itself, to getting back to maximum employment.","Q&A","Press Conf","","325","2021-12"
"2021-12-15","Good afternoon. At the Federal Reserve, we are strongly committed to achieving the monetary policy goals that Congress has given us: maximum employment and price stability. Today, in support of these goals, the Federal Open Market Committee kept interest rates near zero and updated its assessment of the progress that the economy has made toward the criteria specified in the Committee’s forward guidance for interest rates. In addition, in light of the strengthening labor market and elevated inflation pressures, we decided to speed up the reductions in our asset purchases. As I will explain, economic developments and changes in the outlook warrant this evolution of monetary policy, which will continue to provide appropriate support for the economy. Economic activity is on track to expand at a robust pace this year, reflecting progress on vaccinations and the reopening of the economy. Aggregate demand remains very strong, buoyed by fiscal and monetary policy support and the healthy financial positions of households and businesses. The rise in COVID cases in recent weeks, along with the emergence of the Omicron variant, pose[s] risks to the outlook. Notwithstanding the effects of the virus and supply constraints, FOMC participants continue to foresee rapid growth. As shown in our Summary of Economic Projections (SEP), the median projection for real GDP growth stands at 5.5 percent this year and 4 percent next year. Amid improving labor market conditions and very strong demand for workers, the economy has been making rapid progress toward maximum employment. Job gains have been solid in recent months, averaging 378,000 per month over the last three months. The unemployment rate has declined substantially—falling 6/10 of a percentage point since our last the lower end of the wage distribution, as well as for African Americans and Hispanics. Labor force participation showed a welcome rise in November—but remains subdued, in part reflecting the aging of the population and retirements. In addition, some who otherwise would be seeking work report that they are out of the labor force because of factors related to the pandemic, including caregiving needs and ongoing concerns about the virus. At the same time, employers are having difficulties filling job openings, and wages are rising at their fastest pace in many years. How long the labor shortages will persist is unclear, particularly if additional waves of the virus occur. Looking ahead, FOMC participants project the labor market to continue to improve, with the median projection for the unemployment rate declining to 3.5 percent by the end of the year. Compared with the projections made in September, participants have revised their unemployment rate projections noticeably lower for this year and next. Supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic and [to] the reopening of the economy have continued to contribute to elevated levels of inflation. In particular, bottlenecks and supply constraints are limiting how quickly production can respond to higher demand in the near term. These problems have been larger and longer lasting than anticipated, exacerbated by waves of the virus. As a result, overall inflation is running well above our 2 percent longer-run goal and will likely continue to do so well into next year. While the drivers of higher inflation have been predominantly connected to the dislocations caused by the pandemic, price increases have now spread to a broader range of goods and services. Wages have also risen briskly, but, thus far, wage growth has not been a major contributor to the elevated levels of inflation. We are attentive to the risks that persistent real wage growth in excess of productivity [growth] could put projection of FOMC participants falls from 5.3 percent this year to 2.6 percent next year; this trajectory is notably higher than projected in September. We understand that high inflation imposes significant hardship, especially on those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation. We are committed to our price-stability goal. We will use our tools both to support the economy and a strong labor market and to prevent higher inflation from becoming entrenched. We will be watching carefully to see whether the economy is evolving in line with expectations. The Fed’s monetary policy actions have been guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people. In support of these goals, the Committee reaffirmed the 0 to ¼ percent target range for the federal funds rate. We also updated our assessment of the progress the economy has made toward the criteria specified in our forward guidance for the federal funds rate. With inflation having exceeded 2 percent for some time, the Committee expects it will be appropriate to maintain this target range until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee’s assessments of maximum employment. All FOMC participants forecast that this remaining test will be met next year. The median projection for the appropriate level of the federal funds rate is 0.9 percent at the end of 2022, about ½ percentage point higher than projected in September. Participants expect a gradual pace of policy firming, with the level of the federal funds rate generally near estimates of its longer-run level by the end of 2024. Of course, these projections do not represent a At today’s meeting, the Committee also decided to double the pace of reductions in its asset purchases. Beginning in mid-January, we will reduce the monthly pace of our net asset purchases by $20 billion for Treasury securities and $10 billion for agency mortgage-backed securities. If the economy evolves broadly as expected, similar reductions in the pace of net asset purchases will likely be appropriate each month, implying that increases in our securities holdings would cease by mid-March—a few months sooner than we anticipated in early November. We are phasing out our purchases more rapidly because, with elevated inflation pressures and a rapidly strengthening labor market, the economy no longer needs increasing amounts of policy support. In addition, a quicker conclusion of our asset purchases will better position policy to address the full range of plausible economic outcomes. We remain prepared to adjust the pace of purchases if warranted by changes in the economic outlook. And, even after our balance sheet stops expanding, our holdings of securities will continue to foster accommodative financial conditions. To conclude: We understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission. We at the Fed will do everything we can to complete the recovery in employment and achieve our price- stability goal. Thank you.","Opening Statement","Press Conf","","1089","2021-12"
"2021-12-15","So I would say this. I actually think we are well positioned to deal with, with what’s coming, with the range of plausible outcomes that can come. I do. And I think if you look at how we got here, I do think we’ve, we’ve been adapting to the incoming data, really all the way along, and, you know, noticing and calling out that, that the—both the effects and the persistence of inflation of bottlenecks and labor shortages and things like that. So we’ve been calling out the fact that those were becoming longer, and more persistent, and larger. And now we’re in a position where we’re ending our taper within the next—well, by March, in two meetings, and we’ll be in a position to raise interest rates as and when we think it’s appropriate. And we will, if that—to the extent that’s appropriate. At the same time, we’re going to be seeing a few more months of data. I don’t actually think we’re out of position now. I think this was an important move for us to make. I think that the data that we got toward the end of the fall was a—was a really strong signal that inflation is more persistent and higher—and that the risk of it remaining higher for longer has grown. And I think we’re reacting to that now. And we’ll continue to adapt our policy. So I wouldn’t look at it that we’re “behind the curve.” I would look at it that we’re actually in position now to take the steps that we’ll need to take, you know, in a thoughtful manner to address all of the issues, including that of, of too-high inflation.","Q&A","Press Conf","","281","2021-12"
"2021-12-15","Are they separate? So our interest rate—I mean, they are separate tools. So the—you know, the, the asset purchases are a separate tool from interest rates. Stopping asset purchases does not remove accommodation. It just stops adding further accommodation. Whereas raising interest rates starts to remove accommodation from what is a highly accommodative stance. You know, the extent to which they’ll be separated in time is, is something we haven’t really discussed at the Committee [meetings] yet. We will be discussing that, obviously, in coming meetings. I don’t think that, that—the last cycle, there was quite a long separation before interest rates. I don’t think that’s at all likely in this cycle. We’re in a very, very different place with high inflation, strong growth, a really strong economy. You know, that—as I mentioned, the SEP medians are for 4 percent growth next year, 3½ percent— 3½ percent unemployment at the end of the year, and the, the—you know, headline inflation of 2.6 percent next year, core at 2.7. So this is a strong economy, one in which it’s appropriate for, for interest rate hikes. So they’re separate, I would say. Your—sorry, your second question was?","Q&A","Press Conf","","195","2021-12"
"2021-12-15","So, you know, with the balance sheet, we did have a balance sheet discussion, sort of a prelim—a first, first discussion of balance sheet issues today, [balance] sheet issues, at our meeting this week. We’ll have another at the next meeting and another at the interesting and informative. And—but to one degree or another, people noted that this is just a different situation, and those differences should inform the decisions we make about the balance sheet this time. So [we] haven’t made any decisions at all about, about when runoff would start, but we’re—we’ll be continuing to—you know, in relation to when either liftoff happens or the end of the taper. But those are exactly the decisions we’ll be turning to in coming meetings.","Q&A","Press Conf","","124","2021-12"
"2021-12-15","No, I’m not expressing any judgment about, about the stimulus in, in that comment. What I’m saying is, there’s a—there’s a sense among some that “you wanted inflation, this is what you wanted, how do you like it?,” you know? And the truth is, this is not the inflation that we were—what we were talking about in the—in the framework was inflation that comes from a tight labor market, right? So we had 3½ percent unemployment for a period, and we had inflation that was just barely getting to 2 percent. And I—you know, I think, in that setting, our thinking was, we can afford to wait to raise rates until we see actual inflation rather than [acting] preemptive[ly] because, you know, no one had seen what 3½ percent unemployment would look like—with high labor force participation, by the way. No one had seen what it would look—really look like for an extended period, for decades. And we didn’t incorporated that into our framework. This is something completely different. You know, that’s a situation where you had a very, very high level of employment and low inflation. This is literally the opposite. Or, you know, it has been the opposite, where we have very high inflation and we’ve had it since the labor market was in terrible shape. It had nothing—so far, this inflation has really nothing to do with tightness in the labor market. It does have to do with, with strong demand, and strong demand was supported by the Fed, it was supported by Congress. I’m not making any judgments on Congress, it’s not my job. But I will just say, we’re coming out of a, you know, what we certainly hope will be a once in a lifetime, certainly historic—the first really global modern pandemic—which looked at the beginning like it might cause a global depression. And, you know, so we threw a lot of support at it [the economy]. And what’s coming out now is, is, you know, really strong growth, really strong demand, high incomes, and all that kind of thing. You know, people will judge in 25 years whether we—whether we overdid it or not, but, you know, the reality is, we are where we are. And, you know, we think our policy is, is the right one for the situation that we’re in.","Q&A","Press Conf","","390","2021-12"
"2021-12-15","Sure, I’d be happy to talk about that. So, as I mentioned, we got the ECI reading just before the November meeting. We got the labor market report two days after the meeting. And then, one week after that, I think on the 12th of November, we got the CPI reading. It was really the CPI reading, in concert with those two, and I, I just came to the view over that weekend that we needed to speed up the taper. And we started working on that. That's a full 10 days or so before the President made a decision of renominating me. So, honestly, it had—it had nothing to do with that at all. And I just thought this is what we got to do. My colleagues were out talking about the—a faster taper. And that doesn’t happen by accident. They were out talking about a faster taper before the President made his decision. So it’s a decision that effectively was in—more than in train and, you know, to the point where people were talking about it publicly. So that’s what happened. And it had absolutely nothing to do with it whatsoever. We’re always going to just do what we think is the right thing, and I certainly will always just do what I think the right thing is for the economy and for the people that we serve.","Q&A","Press Conf","","230","2021-12"
"2021-12-15","Well, as you know, you know, the SEP is not a plan. It’s not something we debate, negotiate over, or really discuss in terms of what the right answer should be. People write down their, their assumptions—their assessment of appropriate policy based on 4 percent and then unemployment will be 3½ percent by the end of the year. So that’s a really strong economy. And, of course, if the—if the economy turns out to be quite different from that, then so will the rate. You know, we—no one will say, “Oh, we can’t change our policy because we wrote something down in December.” No one’s ever said that or will. It will—the actual rate decisions we make will depend on our evolving assessment of the forecast. So, for example, if, if the economy were to slow down significantly, then you would expect that that would have an effect of slowing down rate increases. But we’d have to—you know, we look at our two goals, maximum employment and price stability, and we make policy based on them, and not with respect to what we wrote down in a prior","Q&A","Press Conf","","188","2021-12"
"2021-12-15","Well, there’s a demographic trend underlying all of this. And we actually got above the demographic trend at the end of the last expansion. But—so one would expect over time that labor force participation would, would move down because an aging population, the older people are, the lower their participation rate is. So you would expect that, that the trend would be lower and that, over time, participation would move down. The question of how much we can get back up closer to where we were in February of 2020—and, indeed, for the year or so before that—is a good one. And, I mean, I—What we can getting paid well. In the labor market we had before, we had, you know—the biggest wage increases were going to people at the bottom end of the wage spectrum for the last couple of years. There were just a lot of really desirable aspects of a labor market like that. Higher participation is one of them. And we’d love to get back there. But, again, ultimately, we have the tools that we have, which are essentially to stimulate demand and also to control inflation. I mean, really, it might be—one of the two big threats to getting back to maximum employment is actually high inflation, because, to get back to where we were, the evidence grows that it’s going to take some time. And what we need is another long expansion, like the ones we’ve been having. Over the last 40 years, we’ve had, I think, three of the four longest in our recorded history, including the last one, which was the longest in our recorded history. That’s what it would really take to get back to the kind of labor market we’d like to see. And to have that happen, we need to make sure that we maintain price stability.","Q&A","Press Conf","","308","2021-12"
"2021-12-15","You know, I think the concerns there are not so much current financial-stability concerns. I, of course, would support the, the views expressed in the President’s Working Group report on stablecoins. Stablecoins can certainly be a useful, efficient, consumer-serving, part of the financial system, if they’re properly regulated. And, right now, they aren’t. And, and they have the potential to scale [up], particularly if they were to be, you know, associated with one of the very large tech networks that exist and you could have a payment network that was immediately systemically important—close to immediately systemically important that didn’t have appropriate regulation and protections. The public relies on the government—and [on] the Fed, in particular—to make sure that the payment system is safe and reliable, as well as the dollar and—you know, to provide a safe and reliable trusted currency. So—but I do think those are longer term. In terms of, you know, the more—the cryptocurrencies, you know, that are really speculative assets, I don’t see them as a financial-stability concern at the moment. I do think they are risky, they’re not backed by anything, and I think there’s big consumer—issues for consumers who may or may not understand what they’re getting. And there’s certainly developments in the—in the markets that are worth following, which are really not in our jurisdiction, but things like, you know, the kind of leverage that’s built into and those sorts of things is certainly worth, worth watching. question.

"2022-01-26","I would just say this. We, we, of course, have a financial stability framework. And what it shows is a number of, of positive aspects of financial stability. But you mentioned, really, [the behavior of] asset prices is one of the four. So asset prices are somewhat elevated, and they reflect a high risk appetite and that sort of thing. I don’t really think asset prices themselves represent a significant threat to financial stability, and that’s because households are in good shape financially than they have been. Businesses are in good shape financially. Defaults on business loans are low and that kind of thing. The banks are highly capitalized with high liquidity and quite resilient and strong. There are some concerns in the—in the nonbank financial sector around—still around money market funds, although the SEC is making—has made some very positive proposals there. And we also saw some things in the Treasury market during the acute phase of the crisis, which, which we’re looking at ways to address. But, overall, the financial stability vulnerabilities are manageable—are manageable, I would say.","Q&A","Press Conf","","180","2022-01"
"2022-01-26","I would describe what we’re doing along these lines. This is going to be a year in which we move steadily away from the very highly accommodative monetary policy that we put in place to deal with the—with the economic effects of the pandemic. And that’s going to involve a number of things. It’s going to involve and does involve finishing asset purchases. It’s going to involve lifting off. And it’s going to involve additional rate increases as appropriate. And we, we have—we’re going to write down in March our next assessment of what that might be. It’s going to continue to evolve as the data evolve. We need to be quite adaptable, I think, in our understanding of this. The last thing we’re going to do is, we’re going to have a couple more meetings, I think, to talk about allowing the balance sheet to begin to run off and [to] do so in a predictable manner. And that’s, that’s something that we will also be doing as appropriate. And I wouldn’t—I don’t think it’s possible to say exactly how this is going to go. And we’re, we’re going to need to be, as I’ve mentioned, nimble about this. And the economy is quite different this time. I’ve said this several times now. The economy is quite different. It’s stronger. Inflation is higher. The labor market is much, much stronger than it was. And growth is above trend, even this year, let alone last year. So all of those things are going to go into our thinking as we make—as we make monetary policy. And","Q&A","Press Conf","","266","2022-01"
"2022-01-26","We’d—that’s, that’s a good question in, in real time. Obviously,","Q&A","Press Conf","","10","2022-01"
"2022-01-26","So we, we do monitor the slope of the yield curve, but we don’t control the slope of the yield curve. Many flat—many factors influence longer-term interest rates. But it is something that we watch, and, and you will know that from when we had this issue a few years ago. And we take it into account, along with many other financial conditions, as we try to assess the implications of all those conditions for the economic outlook. So that’s, that’s one thing I would say. Another is, currently, you’ve got a slope. If you think about 2s to 10s, 2-year Treasury to 10-year Treasury, I think that’s around 75 basis points. That’s well within the range of a normal—of a normal yield-curve slope. So it’s something we’re monitoring. We don’t think of it as—I don’t think of it as some kind of an iron law. But we do look at it and try to understand the implications and what it’s telling us. And it’s—but it’s one of many things that we monitor.","Q&A","Press Conf","","173","2022-01"
"2022-01-26","So I think it’s too soon to write that history, really. But what I would say is this. The—if you remember what it felt like at the beginning of the pandemic, literally the global economy shutting down in large part, including our own economy, and people going to their homes for weeks on end in masks, and there are no vaccines, and it could be a really long And I think Congress responded remarkably with the—with the CARES Act, incredibly timely and very powerful. People will—there’ll always be flaws in these things. But in real time, it was a remarkable achievement. And we responded. And what we were able to do was, you know, stave off a collapse of the financial system at the beginning and make time for what really needed to happen, which was the income replacement and then the recovery that Congress enabled with the CARES Act. So now, that was a lot of—that was a lot. And what we did was a lot. And, you know, now—so, what we have now is, we have the strongest recovery of any, any country. And we have—we have a recovery that looks completely unlike other recoveries that we’ve had, because we’ve, we’ve put so much support behind the recovery. And we’re managing the, the relatively high-class problems that come with that, which are high inflation and a labor shortage. So—and these are serious problems, very serious problems that we, you know, we’re working as hard as we can on. Was it too much? Again, I’m going to leave that to the historians. And—but look, in 25 years, we’ll look back at this incident, which will be a, you know, 2-, 3-, 4-, 5-year period. And we’ll say, you know, we’ll have a—we’ll have a much better basis to make a judgment about the actions that people took. But it was all founded, though, in a—in a very strong reaction to a, you know, to a unique historical event. And I guess I’ll have to leave it at that. I look for—I hope I’ll be around to see how that looks in 25 years.","Q&A","Press Conf","","354","2022-01"

"2022-01-26","So you asked about the risks first. So I—you know, the one risk is that inflation risks are still to the upside in the views of most FOMC participants and, certainly, in my view as well. There’s a risk that, that the high inflation we’re seeing will be prolonged, and there’s a risk that it will move even higher. So we don’t—we don’t think that’s the base case, but you asked what the risks are. And that’s—we have to be in a position with our monetary policy to address all of the plausible outcomes. And that calls for us to be in position. We, we have an expectation about the way the economy is going to be evolved, but we’ve got to be in a position to, to address different outcomes, including the one where inflation remains higher. And, of course, that is a risk to the—to the—to the expansion. You know, we’ve been saying that what we need here is another long expansion, which is the kind of thing we saw over the last [one], which was a record long expansion. We saw labor force participation rise. We saw wages persistently higher for people at the lower end, and there, there really was no obvious So we’d love to find a way to get back to that. That’s going to require price stability, and that’s going to require the Fed to tighten interest rate policy and do our part in getting inflation back down to our 2 percent goal. So I mentioned two-sided risks. You know, a couple things. One, Omi—COVID is not over. And COVID can continue to evolve, and it’s just—we have to accept that it’s not over, and the risks to it can slow down growth. And that would be—that’s sort of a downside risk from a growth standpoint. I would point to—you know, another, another risk is just further, further problems in the supply chains, which could slow down activity. And you see the situation in China as a situation there where that’s—their no-COVID policy may cause more lockdowns, is likely to, and that may play into—may play into more problems in supply chains. In addition, there’s what’s going on in Eastern Europe and things like that. So there’s plenty of risk out there. And we, you know, we can’t—we can’t forget that there are risks on both sides. So that’s, that’s there. That’s what I would say. I know you’ve been all over this issue with, with my colleagues, Craig, on the issue of, of information. We don’t—we don’t have that information at the Board. And, you know, I hand— I asked the inspector general to do an investigation, and that is out of my hands. I play no role in it. I seek to play no role in it. And I don’t—I really—I can’t help you here today on this issue. And I’m sorry I can’t.","Q&A","Press Conf","","483","2022-01"

"2022-01-26","Nothing like that. I mean, I would say you have a tremendously strong labor market. And you have growth this year at—forecast to be well above—well above potential. I mean, people who are forecasting growth think potential growth is around 2 [percent]. Most forecasts [of actual growth] are significantly above that for 2022, and that’s even with, with policy becoming substantially less accommodative. So the labor market’s going to be strong for some time. We’re—ideally, what we’re trying to achieve is inflation getting back down to 2 percent. And we’re trying to do that in a process that, that, that accomplishes—you know, that will also leave the labor market in a very strong position. And no one really knows what that will take. Again, I would say that it isn’t just monetary policy that’s helping inflation get down. It’ll be supply-side improvements, and it’ll be less, less fiscal, you know, less fiscal impulse in all likelihood. So—but monetary policy will do our job. It is our job to get inflation down to 2 percent. And a situation where, where the two goals are—the two goals can be in tension is a difficult one.

And we do that in the expectations would be anchored at 2 percent. So that, that’s the way we think about that. You know, it—what was the last part of your—of your question?","Q&A","Press Conf","","90","2022-01"
"2022-01-26","Good afternoon. At the Federal Reserve, we are strongly committed to achieving the monetary policy goals that Congress has given us: maximum employment and price stability. Today, in support of these goals, the Federal Open Market Committee kept its policy interest rate near zero and stated its expectation that an increase in this rate would soon be appropriate. The Committee also agreed to continue reducing its net asset purchases on the schedule we announced in December—bringing them to an end in early March. As I will explain, against a backdrop of elevated inflation and a strong labor market, our policy has been adapting to the evolving economic environment, and it will continue to do so. Economic activity expanded at a robust pace last year, reflecting progress on vaccinations and the reopening of the economy, fiscal and monetary policy support, and the healthy financial positions of households and businesses. Indeed, the economy has shown great strength and resilience in the face of the ongoing pandemic. The recent sharp rise in COVID cases associated with the Omicron variant will surely weigh on economic growth this quarter. High-frequency indicators point to reduced spending in COVID-sensitive sectors, such as travel and restaurants. And activity more broadly may also be affected as many workers are unable to report for work because of illness, quarantines, or caregiving needs. Fortunately, health experts are finding that the Omicron variant has not been as virulent as previous strains of the virus, and they expect that cases will drop off rapidly. If the wave passes quickly, the economic effects should as well, and we would see a return to strong growth. That said, the implications for the economy remain uncertain. And we have not lost sight of the The labor market has made remarkable progress and, by many measures, is very strong. Job gains have been solid in recent months, averaging 365,000 per month over the past three months. Over the past year, payroll employment has risen by 6.4 million jobs. The unemployment rate has declined sharply, falling 2 percentage points over the past six months to reach 3.9 percent in December. The improvements in labor market conditions have been widespread, including for workers at the lower end of the wage distribution, as well as for African Americans and Hispanics. Labor demand remains historically strong. With constraints on labor supply, employers are having difficulties filling job openings, and wages are rising at their fastest pace in many years. While labor force participation has edged up, it remains subdued, in part reflecting the aging of the population and retirements. In addition, some who would otherwise would be seeking work report that they are out of the labor force because of factors related to the pandemic, including caregiving needs and ongoing concerns about the virus. The current wave of the virus may well prolong these effects. Over time, there are good reasons to expect some further improvements in participation and employment. Inflation remains well above our longer-run goal of 2 percent. Supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic and [to] the reopening of the economy have continued to contribute to elevated levels of inflation. In particular, bottlenecks and supply constraints are limiting how quickly production can respond to higher demand in the near term. These problems have been larger and longer lasting than anticipated, exacerbated by waves of the virus. goods and services. Wages have also risen briskly, and we are attentive to the risks that persistent real wage growth in excess of productivity [growth] could put upward pressure on inflation. Like most forecasters, we continue to expect inflation to decline over the course of the year. We understand that high inflation imposes significant hardship, especially on those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation. In addition, we believe that the best thing we can do to support continued labor market gains is to promote a long expansion, and that will require price stability. We are committed to our price-stability goal. We will use our tools both to support the economy and a strong labor market and to prevent higher inflation from becoming entrenched. And we’ll be watching carefully to see whether the economy is evolving in line with expectations. The Fed’s monetary policy actions have been guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people. As I noted, the Committee left the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged and reaffirmed our plan, announced in December, to end asset purchases in early March. In light of the remarkable progress we’ve seen in the labor market and inflation that is well above our 2 percent longer-run goal, the economy no longer needs sustained high levels of monetary policy support. That is why we are phasing out our asset purchases and why we expect it will soon be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate. Of course, the economic outlook remains highly uncertain. Making appropriate monetary policy in this environment requires humility, recognizing that the economy evolves in inflation is more persistent than expected, and are prepared to respond as appropriate to achieve our goals. To provide greater clarity about our approach for reducing the size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet, today the Committee issued a set of principles that will provide a foundation for our future decisions. [In] these high-level principles, [we] clarify that the federal funds rate is our primary means of adjusting monetary policy and that reducing our balance sheet will occur after the process of raising interest rates has begun. Reductions will occur over time in a predictable manner primarily through adjustments to reinvestments so that securities roll off our balance sheet. Over time, we intend to hold securities in the amounts needed for our ample- reserves operating framework, and in the longer run, we envision holding primarily Treasury securities. Our decisions to reduce our balance sheet will be guided by our maximum-employment and price-stability goals. In that regard, we will be prepared to adjust any of the details of our approach to balance sheet management in light of economic and financial developments. The Committee has not made decisions regarding the specific timing, pace, or other details of shrinking the balance sheet. And we will discuss these matters in upcoming meetings and provide additional information at the appropriate time. To conclude: We understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission. We at the Federal Reserve will do everything we can to achieve our maximum-employment and price- stability goals. Thank you.","Opening Statement","Press Conf","","1105","2022-01"
"2022-01-26","Thanks. So, as I—as I referred to in my opening statement, it’s—it is not possible to predict with much confidence exactly what path for our policy rate is going to prove appropriate. And so, at this time, we haven’t made any decisions about the path of policy. And I stress again that we’ll be humble and nimble. We’re going to have to navigate crosscurrents and actually two-sided risks now. So—and, and I’ll say also that we’re going to be guided by the data. In fact, what I’ll say is that we’re going to be led by the incoming data and the evolving outlook, which we’ll try to communicate as clearly as possible, moving steadily and transparency—transparently. So more to your question, we know that the economy is in a very different place than it was when we began raising rates in 2015. Specifically, the economy is now much stronger. The labor market is far stronger. Inflation is running well above our 2 percent target, much higher than it was at that time. And these differences are likely to have important implications for the appropriate pace of policy adjustments. Beyond that, we haven’t made any decisions.","Q&A","Press Conf","","195","2022-01"
"2022-01-26","Sorry. Just getting both, both parts of your question written down. So I would say—and this view is widely held on the Committee—that both sides of the mandate are calling for us to move steadily away from the very highly accommodative policies we put in place during the challenging economic conditions that the economy faced earlier in the pandemic. And I would say that most FOMC participants agree that labor market conditions are consistent with maximum employment in the sense of the highest level of employment that is consistent with price stability. And that is—that is my personal view. And, and, again, very broad support on the Committee for the judgment that it will soon be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate. The other thing is, maximum employment will, will evolve over time and through the course of the business cycle. In the particular situation we’re in now, it may well increase. Max—the level of maximum—of employment that’s consistent with stable prices may increase. And we hope that it will, as more people come back into the labor market, as participation gradually rises. And the policy path that we’re broadly contemplating would be supportive of that comment—that outcome as well. So the thing about the labor market right now is that there are—there are many millions of, of more job openings than there are unemployed people. So you ask whether we can— whether we can raise rates and, and move to less accommodative, and even tight, financial labor market. Record levels of job openings, of quits. Wages are moving up at the highest pace they have in decades. If you look at surveys of workers, they find jobs plentiful. Look at surveys of companies—they find workers scarce. And all of those readings are at levels, really, that we haven’t seen in a long time—and, in some cases, ever. So this is a very, very strong labor market, and my strong sense is that we can—we can—we can move rates up without, without having to, you know, severely undermine it. I also would point out that there are—there are other forces at work this year, which should also help bring down inflation, we hope, including improvement on the supply side, which will ultimately come. The timing and pace of that are uncertain. And also, fiscal policy is going to be less supportive of, of growth this year—not of the level of economic activity, but the fiscal impulse to growth will be significantly lower. So there are multiple forces—which should be working over the course of the year for inflation to come down. We do realize that the timing and pace of that are, are highly uncertain and that inflation has persisted longer than we—than we thought. And, of course, we’re prepared to use our tools to assure that higher inflation does not become entrenched.","Q&A","Press Conf","","478","2022-01"
"2022-01-26","So I’m afraid to tell you that those are all great questions, and they’re questions that the Committee is just turning to now. So we had—we had a discussion, as you know, at the last meeting, an introductory discussion of the balance sheet and a teeing up of the issues. At this meeting, we’ve gone through and carefully put together a set of principles at a high level. And those are meant to guide the actual decisions we’ll make about the pace and about all of the questions that you’re, you’re asking. And I expect that this process will, will be something that we spend time on in coming meetings. I can’t tell you how many. I can’t tell you how long it will take. But—and then, you know, at the appropriate time, we’ll provide additional information. So I did—the last cycle when we—when we went through balance sheet issues, we did find that over, over the course of two or three meetings, for example, we did come to interesting and better answers, we thought. So we’re just in that process now. And at the next meeting, we’ll be turning to, you know, more of the details that you’re—that you’re asking about. I would say this. The balance sheet is, is much bigger. I’d say it has a shorter duration than the last time. And the economy’s much stronger, and inflation is much higher. So—and I think that leads you to—and I said, I’ve said this—being willing to move sooner than we did the last time and also perhaps faster. But beyond that, it’s really—it’s really not appropriate for me to speculate exactly what that would be. And, and—but I would point you to principle number one, which is “the Committee views changes in the target range for the federal funds rate as its primary means of adjusting the stance of monetary policy.” So we do want the federal funds rate—we, we want to operationalize that [as the primary means]. And we want the balance sheet","Q&A","Press Conf","","336","2022-01"
"2022-01-26","So, again, we think of the balance sheet as, as moving in a predictable manner, sort of in the background, and that the active tool meeting to meeting is not both of them, it’s the federal funds rate. There are—there are rules of thumb—I’m reluctant to land on one of them—that, that equate this. And—but there’s also an element of, of uncertainty around the balance sheet. I think we have a much better sense, frankly, of how rate increases affect financial conditions and, hence, economic conditions. Balance sheet [policy] is, is still a relatively new thing for, for the markets and for us, so we’re less certain about that. So, again, our—I think our—the pattern we’ll follow is to—is to arrive at a, you know, a timing and a pace and composition and all those things and then announce that with advance notice, and, and it will—it will start in the background. And then we’ll look to have that just running in the background and have—and have the interest rates, again, be the active tool of monetary policy. That’s, that’s at least the plan. I can’t tell you much more about any of the— any of the very good issues about size, pace, composition, those sorts of things. But we’ll be turning to all of those at coming meetings.","Q&A","Press Conf","","219","2022-01"
"2022-01-26","So, as you know, the ultimate focus that we have is on the real economy: maximum employment and price stability. And financial conditions matter to the extent that they have implications for achieving the dual mandate. And you also know that we, we look at broader financial conditions, not one or two things, one or two markets. And what we’re always asking ourselves is, are we seeing changes that are both persistent and material enough that—of a change in financial conditions—that they are inconsistent with the achievement of our goals? So that’s how we’re looking at that. And I don’t want to comment on today’s financial conditions broadly, but we’re not looking at any one market or, or so. So that’s how we’re thinking. In terms of what we’ve seen, I would say this. We, you know, we said at our last meeting we published the Summary of Economic Projections, the median of which—the median participant expected three rate increases this year. And, you know, it’s six weeks, seven weeks later now. And you have seen that our communication channel with the markets is working. Markets are, are now pricing in a number of rate increases. Surveys show that market participants are expecting a balance sheet runoff to begin, you know, at the appropriate time, sometime later this year perhaps. We haven’t made that decision yet. So we, we feel like the communications we have with market participants and with the general public are working and","Q&A","Press Conf","","246","2022-01"
"2022-01-26","Well, you’re right. We haven’t got—we haven’t gotten to that point yet. We haven’t made a decision yet, and we’ll make that decision at the March meeting. We’ll make a decision whether to raise the federal funds rate. I would say that the Committee is, is of a mind to, to raise the federal funds rate at the March meeting, assuming that conditions are appropriate for doing so. We have—we have our eyes on, on the risks, particularly around the world. But we do expect some softening in the economy from Omicron, but we think that that should be temporary. And we think that the economy should—the underlying strength of the economy should, you know, should, should—show through fairly quickly after that.","Q&A","Press Conf","","122","2022-01"
"2022-01-26","Progress on vaccinations and an easing of supply constraints were expected to support continued gains in economic activity and employment as well as a reduction in inflation, but risks to the economic outlook remained, including from new variants of the virus.","Participants' Views","Minutes","N/A","41","2022-01"
"2022-01-26","I think the path is highly uncertain and that we’re committed to using our tools to make sure that inflation, high inflation that we’re seeing, does not become entrenched. So a number of factors would be—it’s not just monetary policy—a number of that it will come slower than, than we had expected and hoped—that there will be relief on the supply side. So that, too, should—should lower the supply-side barriers, which are a big part of the story of why inflation is high. In addition, monetary policy will be becoming significantly less accommodative. So the question is—you know, we’ll, we’ll be asking this question all year long, and that will be, are things turning out as we expect? There’s a case that, for whatever reason, the economy slows more and inflation slows more than expected; we’ll react to that. If, instead, we see inflation at a higher level or a more persistent level, then we’ll react to that. And, again, we’re, we’re well aware that this is a different economy than—than existed during the last tightening cycle, and our policy is going to reflect those differences.","Q&A","Press Conf","","186","2022-01"
"2022-01-26","So let me—let me—let me start by talking about that last paragraph. So you’ll remember during the last cycle that this process of building up and then shrinking the balance sheet is a complicated one, and it involves, inevitably, surprises. And so during, during the years, during the prior cycle, we amended our balance sheet principles a number of times. Now, we didn’t intend to do that. It just—events required us to do so. So we got a pretty robust paragraph there that says we’re free to do this at any time. And it doesn’t mean we’re going to, but if the situation turns out to be different than we had thought, we’re not going to be—we’re not going to stick with something that isn’t working. That’s all that’s saying. It’s meant to be quite a general statement rather than a, a hint. So, I mean, I like to think that our, you know, our philosophy of the balance sheet is, is embodied in these principles. So, you know, the idea that, for example, the federal funds rate is the primary means of adjusting the stance of policy, that we’ll use—determine the timing and pace of reducing the size of the balance sheet to foster the dual mandate, that we’ll begin to reduce the size after we begin the process of raising rates, and on and on like that. I mean, that— those are all the things that, that try to describe how we will proceed. function, as they were at—right after the—in the critical phase of the Global Financial Crisis. And then after [that], they were a macroeconomic tool to support demand. And now the economy no longer needs this, this highly accommodative policy that we put in place. So it’s time to stop asset purchases first and then, at the appropriate time, start to shrink the balance sheet. Now, the balance sheet is, is substantially larger than it needs to be. We’ve identified the end state as—in amounts needed to implement monetary policy efficiently [and] effectively in the ample-reserves regime. So there’s a substantial amount of, of shrinkage in the balance sheet to be done. That’s going to take some time. We want that process to be orderly and predictable. And so those are some of the ways that I would think this, this lays out our, you know, the way we—the way we’re thinking about this. In terms of the timing, I can’t really help you. You know, it just says after, after we get under way. So we’re—I would say we are, we’re going to have another discussion at, at the next meeting. And my guess is, we’ll have at least one other discussion at the meeting after that. And, you know, we’ll, we’ll tell you as we make progress. And we’ll, you know, we’ll start the process of allowing runoff and shrinking the balance sheet at what we find to be the appropriate time. It’s—I wish I could say more. But, honestly, we haven’t made those decisions. And we actually haven’t even really had the, the important discussions on a lot of the details that we will have at coming meetings.","Q&A","Press Conf","","526","2022-01"
"2022-01-26","So it’s, it’s more a matter of—I think the problem that we’re—that we’re talking about here is really that people who are on fixed incomes who are living paycheck to paycheck, they’re spending most or all of their—of, of what they’re earning on food, gasoline, rent, heating their—heating, things like that, basic necessities. And so inflation right away, right away forces people like that to make very difficult decisions. So that’s really the point. I don’t—I’m not aware of, you know, inflation literally falling more on, on different socioeconomic groups. It’s—that’s not the point. The point is, some people are just really in a—prone to suffer more. I mean, for people who are economically well off, inflation isn’t good. It’s bad. High inflation is, is bad, but they’re going to be able to continue to eat and keep their homes and drive that it’s particularly hard on people with fixed incomes and low incomes who spent most of their—of their income on necessities, which are—which are experiencing high inflation now.","Q&A","Press Conf","","170","2022-01"
"2022-01-26","So, as I mentioned, we have not made these decisions. We really haven’t. And, and what I can tell you now, though, is that we fully appreciate that this is a different situation. If you look back to where we were in 2015, ’16, ’17, ’18 when we were raising rates, inflation was very close to 2 percent, even below 2 percent. Unemployment was, was not at our estimates of the natural rate. And growth was, you know, in the 2 to 3 percent range. Right now, we have inflation running substantially above 2 percent and, and, you know, more persistently than we would like. We have growth—even in forecasts, even in the somewhat reduced forecast for 2022—we still see growth higher than, substantially higher than what we estimate to be the potential growth rate. And we see a labor market where, by so many measures, it is historically tight. I think the—you know, in a way, the least tight aspect of it is, is looking at the unemployment rate, which is still below our median estimate of, of [the unemployment rate consistent with] maximum employment. If you look at things like quits and job openings, as I mentioned earlier, and wages, you’re seeing—and, and just the ratio of job openings to unemployed—you’re seeing a very, very tight labor market. Now, we also know that labor force participation is significantly lower. It’s 1½ percentage points lower than it was in February of 2020. Maybe a [full] percentage point of could come back into the labor force. But it’s not happening very quickly, and it may not—it may continue to not happen very quickly as long as the pandemic is on[going]. So that’s, that’s, that’s how we think about that. We haven’t made—to your specific question—we really have not addressed those questions. And we’ll begin to address them as we—as we move into the March meeting and meetings after that.","Q&A","Press Conf","","319","2022-01"
"2022-01-26","So I’d say, you know, since, since the December meeting, I would say that the inflation situation is about the same but probably slightly worse. I’d be inclined to raise my own estimate of 2022 core PCE inflation—let’s just go with that—by a few tenths today. But we’re not writing, writing down an SEP at this meeting. But I think it’s—it hasn’t gotten better. It’s probably gotten just a—just a bit worse, and that’s been the pattern. That’s been the pattern. So I think if you look at the—the FOMC participants are—there’s a range there. And that range has been moving to the right for, for a year now. And, by the way, if you look at other forecasters, essentially all other macro forecasters who do this for a living, you’ve seen the same pattern. So, what do we think about that? Well, I think we, you know, we wrote down rate increases in the December meetings, each of us individually. And I think to the extent the situation deteriorates further, our policy will have to address that, if it deteriorates meaningfully further, either in the time dimension or in the size of the inflation dimension. So that’s how we’re thinking about it. over time, to a policy that’s not accommodative, in time. I don’t know when that will be. That’s—those are the things that we’re—that we’re thinking about. That’s, that’s part of it. Another part of it is that fiscal policy provided an impulse to growth over the last two years. That impulse will be less, in fact, will be—will be negative this year. And so that’s another thing. The other one is, we will eventually get relief on the supply side. And, you know, the ports will be cleared up. And there will be semiconductors and things like that. Now, what we’re learning is, it’s just taking much longer, so I think—longer than expected. And that, I think, does raise, raise the risk that high inflation will be more persistent. I do think we’ll come off of the highs that we saw in the early part of this episode in the—in the spring last year. But, really, what’s—the question is going to be, what is inflation running at? And so we’ll be watching that. And I, you know, we—our objective is to get inflation back down to 2 percent. It’s also to provide enough support to keep the labor market healthy. The labor market is very, very strong right now, and I think that that strength will continue. There’s a—there’s really a shortage of workers. We see it particularly among production and nonsupervisory workers and people in the lowest quartile. You see very large wage increases. I mentioned some of the other indicators. So I think that’s, that’s what we’re looking at. And we’re also—you know, we realize, I think, as everyone does, that this outlook is quite uncertain and that we’re going to have to adapt. And we’re going to communicate as clearly as we can. But we’re going to have to be adaptable and, you know, move, move as appropriate.","Q&A","Press Conf","","514","2022-01"

"2022-03-16","Well, yes. So I would say, we look at a broad range of financial conditions. And, of course, when we tighten monetary policy, we do expect that they will adjust in sync over time with monetary policy. It’s not any particular financial condition, but a broad range of financial conditions. They will reflect to some extent—they reflect any number of things. But, yes, we need our policy to transmit to the real economy. And it does so through financial conditions, which means that, as we tighten policy or remove accommodation so that","Q&A","Press Conf","","92","2022-03"
"2022-03-16","Right. So our, if you look, our—first of all, there is no—you’re looking at medians. But understand that there’s no, it’s not something we voted on. It’s not a plan. But if you look, people do have their in—by the end of this year, broadly, people are at or close to or, in some cases, above their estimates of longer-run neutral interest rate. Okay. So that should stop pushing—that should, in other words, that should be a removal of accommodation for monetary policy, basically. At the same time, we will have done significant balance sheet runoff. And you can think of that as further. In the next year, and just looking at the median, you’re now above the, you know, above the, what people estimate to be the longer-run median. And also, in many people’s forecasts, that actually amounts to, you know, tight policy under, in real rates as well. So why does unemployment remain at 3.5 percent? You know, it—I mean, a couple points. One is the connection between—in the economy we had before the pandemic, the connection between inflation and the level of the unemployment rate was not very tight. long run with 2 percent inflation, will move back down to levels which are still very attractive, full-economy kind of—full-employment kind of wages, but not to a point where they’re pushing up inflation anymore. And, as I mentioned, there are a lot of factors causing inflation to come down. And, you know, the reality is, there are many, many moving pieces, and we don’t know what will actually happen. But no matter what happens, this is a Committee that is determined to use its tools to make sure that higher inflation does not become entrenched. And so we are determined on that front, and we’ll deal with what comes. This is a modal, or most likely, expectation. But we’ll deal with what comes, whether it’s better or worse.","Q&A","Press Conf","","320","2022-03"
"2022-03-16","Well, if you take a look at today’s labor market, what you have is 1.7-plus job openings for every unemployed person. So that’s a very, very tight labor market— tight to an unhealthy level, I would say. So, in principle, if you were—let’s say that our tools work about as you described, and the idea is, we’re trying to better align demand and supply, let’s just say in the labor market. So it would actually, if you were just moving down the number of job openings so that they were more like one to one, you would have less upward pressure on We’re hearing from companies that they can’t hire enough people. They’re having a hard time hiring. So that’s really the thinking there, is, you know, these are fairly well-understood channels, interest sensitive. And, basically, across the economy, we’d like to slow demand so that it’s better aligned with supply; give supply, at the same time, time to recover; and get into a better, you know, a better alignment of supply and demand. And that, over time, should bring inflation down. And I’ll say again, though, you know, we don’t have a perfect crystal ball about the future, and we’re prepared to use our tools as needed to restore price stability. You know, as I mentioned in my opening remarks, without price stability, there—you really can’t have a sustained period of maximum employment. It’s our—one of our most fundamental obligations is to maintain and restore, in this case, price stability. So we’re very committed to that. Of course, the plan is to restore price stability while also sustaining a strong labor market. That is our intention, and we believe we can do that. But we have to restore price stability.","Q&A","Press Conf","","291","2022-03"
"2022-03-16","So, as you know, policy works through financial conditions. That’s how it reaches the real economy—by just the mechanisms you mentioned. And remember that the financial conditions we had for the last couple of years were a function not only of very aggressive, and appropriately so, fiscal policy, but also highly accommodative monetary policy—the monetary policy settings that we put in place at the worst parts of the pandemic. So it is very appropriate to move away from those. And, yes, that will lead to some tightening in financial conditions in the form of higher interest rates and just the sorts of things—we’re not targeting any one or more of those things, but financial conditions generally should move to a more normal level so that—because we know the economy no longer needs, or wants, these very highly accommodative, this stance, which, you know, so it’s time to move to a more normal setting of financial conditions, and we do that by moving monetary policy itself to more normal levels.","Q&A","Press Conf","","169","2022-03"
"2022-03-16","Right. So we are not—we don’t have the luxury of 20/20 hindsight in actually implementing real-time decisions in the world. So, you know, so the question is—the right question is, did you make the right decisions based on what you knew at the time? But that’s not the question I was answering, which is knowing what you know now. So I think if we what was going to happen, then in hindsight, yes. It would have been appropriate to move earlier. Obviously, it would be. But, again, we don’t have that luxury. And then, so, but that’s a separate question from your other question, which is “behind the curve.” And, you know, I don’t have the luxury of looking at it that way. You know, we are, we have our tools—powerful tools—and the Committee is very focused on using them. We’re acutely aware of the need to restore price stability while keeping a strong labor market. And what I saw today was a Committee that is strongly committed to achieving price stability, in particular, and prepared to use our tools to do that. We’re not going to let high inflation become entrenched. The costs of that would be too high. And we’re not going to wait so long that we have to do that. No one wants to have to really put restrictive monetary policy on, in order to get inflation back down. So, frankly, the need is one of getting back up, getting rates back up to more neutral levels as quickly as we practicably can and then moving beyond that, if that turns out to be appropriate. And, as you can see, it is appropriate in the sense that, [in] people’s [contributions to the] SEPs, they do write down levels of interest rates that are above their estimate of the longer-run neutral rate. And there’s also a range of estimates, too, as you will see if you look at the details of the","Q&A","Press Conf","","325","2022-03"
"2022-03-16","So the way I would say it is this: We, first of all, I would agree with the premise that wages moving up is a great thing. You know, that’s how the standard of living rises over time. And, generally, it’s driven over long periods by rising productivity. But what we have now, if you look at these, the wage increases that we have, we look at a—we’re blessed with a range of measures of wages that all measure different things. But right now, they’re all showing the same thing, which is that the increases—not the levels, but the increases—are running at levels that are well above what would be consistent with 2 percent inflation, our goal, over time. And that may be—we don’t know how persistent that phenomenon will be. It’s very hard to say. And that’s really, I think, the sense of your question about a wage–price spiral; is that something that’s going to start happening and become entrenched in the system? We don’t see that. You can see, for example, in some sectors that got very high wage increases early on, those wage increases looked like they may have slowed down to a normal level. But it comes back to, you know, what I’m saying here—which is, there’s a misalignment of demand and supply, guide inflation back down to 2 percent. And that would be in the context of an extraordinarily strong labor market. We think this labor market can handle, as I mentioned, tighter monetary policy. And the overall economy can as well. But, yes, wages are moving up faster than is consistent with 2 percent inflation, but it’s good to see that moving up. But it wouldn’t be sustainable over too long of a period to see them moving up that much higher. And that’s because of this misalignment between supply and demand. We expect to get more labor supply. We did last time. We got more than we expected during the last cycle. This time, we’ve gotten much less than expected. So it’s not easy to predict these things. But we do expect that we’ll get people coming back in the labor market, particularly as COVID becomes less and less of a factor in many people’s lives, something we all wish. But, so that’s how we think about it.","Q&A","Press Conf","","385","2022-03"
"2022-03-16","Well, so, of course, central bankers around the world are generally very in favor of these sanctions. But let me say this: Sanctions are really the business of the elected government, and that’s true everywhere. So the Administration and the Treasury comment on sanctions really much because, again, they’re not for us [to decide]. We have a very specific mandate. And these are really the province of elected governments, as I mentioned. So I’d have to leave it at that. Sorry.","Q&A","Press Conf","","81","2022-03"
"2022-03-16","Well, I, you know, I say that our intention is to bring inflation back down to 2 percent, while still sustaining a strong labor market and that the economy is very strong. If you look at where forecasts are, people are forecasting growth that’s strong within the context of","Q&A","Press Conf","","49","2022-03"
"2022-03-16","Well, that is—yes, indeed. I mean, as I just said, you know, I think we do understand very much, and we very much take to heart, that it’s our obligation to restore price stability. And, you know, we’ve had price stability for a very long time and maybe come to take it for granted. But now we see the pain. I’m old enough to remember what very high inflation was like. And, you know, we’re strongly committed as a Committee to not allowing this higher inflation to become entrenched and to use our tools to bring inflation back down to more normal levels, which—our target is 2 percent inflation. So we will do that. And I just would want people to understand that, and that’s—but the way we do that is by raising interest rates and by shrinking our balance sheet. And so financial conditions will become, at the margin, less supportive of various kinds of economic activity. That will slow the economy, while also allowing the labor market to remain very strong. And, you know, the good news is, the economy and the labor market are quite strong. And that means the economy, we think, can handle interest rate increases.","Q&A","Press Conf","","201","2022-03"
"2022-03-16","Sure. So I guess I’d start by just assuring everyone that we’re fully committed to bringing inflation back down and also sustaining the economic expansion. We do understand that these higher prices, no matter what the source, have real effects on people’s well- being. And, really, high inflation takes a toll on everyone. But it’s really, especially, on people who use most of their income to buy essentials like food, housing, and transportation, where—I mean, we’ve all seen charts that show, if you’re a middle-income person, you’ve got room to absorb some inflation. If you’re at the lower end of the income spectrum, it’s very hard because you’re spending most of your money already on necessities, and the price is going up. But it’s punishing for everyone. So it has been a difficult time for the economy. But we do anticipate that inflation will move back down, as I mentioned earlier. It may take longer than we like, but I’m confident that we’ll use our tools to bring inflation down. You asked about rates. So the way that works, I would explain, is, as we raise interest rates, that should gradually slow down demand for the interest-sensitive parts of the economy. And so what we would see is demand slowing down, but just enough so that it’s better matched with supply. And that brings—that will bring inflation down over time. That’s our plan.","Q&A","Press Conf","","233","2022-03"
"2022-03-16","The goal, of course, is to restore price stability while also sustaining a strong labor market. We have a dual mandate, and they’re sort of equal. But, as I said earlier, you know, price stability is an essential goal. In fact, it’s a precondition, really, for achieving the kind of labor market that we want, which is a strong and sustained labor market. We saw the benefits of a long expansion, a sustained labor market. It pulled people back in, and there were really no imbalances in the economy that threatened the long expansion. It, just, the pandemic arrived; it was just a completely exogenous event. So that’s how we’re thinking about it. We, of course, want to achieve, you know, price stability with a strong labor market. But we do understand also that, really, you can’t have maximum employment for any sustained period without price stability. So we need to focus on price stability particularly, because the labor market is so strong and the economy is so strong. We feel like the economy can handle tighter monetary policy. Wanted to ask just kind of the broad question about how you are communicating what the Fed’s doing here today to the average American who might not be reading the dot plots or understanding what the SEP is. How is the 25 basis point hike today and then the signaling on future Fed policy going to address the inflation that they’re feeling at the stores on a daily basis?","Q&A","Press Conf","","248","2022-03"
"2022-03-16","Yes. So I want to clear one thing up again. And that is that nothing in our new framework or in the changes that we made has caused us to wait longer to raise interest rates. What we said in the framework changes was—and this was really a reflection of what had happened for the preceding couple of decades, actually. What we said was, if we see, you know, low unemployment, high employment, but we don’t see inflation, then we’re not going to raise rates ’til we actually see inflation. That’s what we said, and that was the sense of it. There was no sense in which, if we got a burst of really high inflation, we would wait to raise rates. That’s simply not in the framework. In fact, quite the contrary. The framework is all about anchoring inflation expectations at 2 percent. So I do hear this, you know, that the framework—really, we can’t blame the framework. It was a sudden, unexpected burst of inflation. And then it was the reaction to it, and it was what it was. But it was not in any way caused by or related to the framework. So, come to today. You know, I think our vision on this on the Committee is very, very clear. What we see is a strong labor market. We see a labor market with a lot of momentum, great job creation. And we see the underlying economy’s strong. Balance sheets are strong. Yes, there are threats to growth But inflation is far above our target. And, you know, the help we’ve been expecting and other forecasters have been expecting from supply-side improvement, labor force participation, bottlenecks, all those things getting better—it hasn’t come. And so we’re looking now to using our tools to restore price stability, and we’re committed to doing that. And you see that, I think, in the Summary of Economic Projections. And you see that in the decision we make, and you’ll continue to see it in the decisions we make, going forward.","Q&A","Press Conf","","340","2022-03"
"2022-03-16","Yes. Thank you for asking. So, at our meeting today and yesterday, we made excellent progress toward agreeing on the parameters of a plan to shrink the balance sheet.

That’s not a decision that we’ve made. But I would say that that’s how well our discussions went in the last two days. So a couple things just to add. We’ll be mindful of the broader financial and economic context when we make the decision on timing, and we always want to use our tools to support macroeconomic and financial stability. We want to avoid adding uncertainty to what’s a highly uncertain situation already. So all of that will go into the thinking of the timing around this. In terms of the—I would say this. I don’t want to get too much into the details, because we’re literally just finalizing them. But the framework is going to look very familiar to people who are familiar with the last time we did this. But it’ll be faster than the last time.

In other cases, it’s pretty clear that inflation has spread more broadly across services. And, yes, that is concerning. In the meanwhile, we see some progress on the good side.

Aggregate demand is currently strong, and most forecasters expect it to remain so. If you look at the labor market, [you find that it is] also very strong. Conditions are tight, and payroll job growth is withstand, but certainly flourish—as well in the face of less accommodative monetary policy. So I guess that’s how I would say I’m looking at that. Of course, the objective is to achieve price stability while also sustaining a strong labor market. And that is our overall objective.

"2022-03-16","I don’t think that’s a big piece of it, actually. I think some of that is just an early assessment of the effects of spillovers from the war in Eastern Europe, which will hit our economy through a number of channels. Highly uncertain, but, you know, you’re looking at higher oil prices, higher commodity prices. It’ll be—we think that will weigh on GDP to some extent. So that’s part of what moved those assessments down. I don’t think—I mean, I think, generally, monetary policy works with a lag, so some of that would also be in there. But remember, as well, that 2.8 percent is still very strong growth. If we think that the potential growth rate of the economy is somewhere between, somewhere around 1.75 percent, 2.8 percent is strong economic growth. It would have been one of the strongest years, in fact, of the last expansion. So, while it’s lower than last year’s 5.8 percent, it’s still quite strong growth.

"2022-03-16","So, you know, the way we’re thinking about this is that every meeting is a live meeting. And we’re going to be looking at evolving conditions.

I can’t be perfectly specific about it, but that’s certainly a possibility as we go through the year.","Q&A","Press Conf","","65","2022-03"
"2022-03-16","So that’s one of many ways of capturing the situation, which is that we—the Committee really does understand that the time for rate increases and for shrinking the balance sheet has come. And I would just say, I would go back to “the economy is very strong,” as I mentioned. Tremendous momentum in the labor market. We expect growth to continue. As I—it’s clearly time to raise interest rates and begin the balance sheet shrinkage. determined to use our tools to do exactly that. You couched it in terms of real rates. I would say, if you look at the SEP, you’ve got people getting close to or even above, in many cases, their estimate of the longer-run neutral rate. So I understand that doesn’t do it for real rates. But if you go out a year or two, many people are, in their forecasts, are having tight policy from a real interest rate standpoint. So that’s something that we’re focused on. Of course, it’s a highly uncertain environment. And, you know, we don’t know what’s going to happen. But we do know that we’re going to deploy our tools to achieve our goals—and that includes the price-stability goal.","Q&A","Press Conf","","199","2022-03"

"2022-03-16","In conjunction with this FOMC meeting, participants submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation for each year from 2022 through 2024 and over the longer run based on their individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy, including the path of the federal funds rate.","Participants' Views","Minutes","N/A","53","2022-03"
"2022-03-16","So I guess I would say that at the—before the invasion of Ukraine by Russia—so let’s go back to that. I would have said that the expectation was that inflation would peak sometime in the first quarter, maybe the end of the first quarter of this year, and then maybe stay at that level or a little bit lower and then start to come down in the back half of the year. So now we’re, you know, we’re getting—we’re going—we’re already seeing a little bit of short- term upward pressure in inflation due to higher oil prices, natural gas [prices] a little bit but not so much for us since we have our own natural gas supply, other commodities prices. going to mean more tangled supply chains. So that could actually push out [in time] the relief we were expecting on supply chains generally. So I guess I would say that the expectation is still that inflation will begin to come down in the second half of the year. But if you look at where I read the SEP headline median, we still expect inflation to be high this year, lower than last year, and then we expect—though, particularly with the effects of the war, but also the data we’ve seen so far this year—we expect inflation to remain high through the middle of the year, begin to come down, and then come down more sharply next year.","Q&A","Press Conf","","238","2022-03"

"2022-03-16","So I don’t—Neil, I’ve never talked about my own SEP projection. It’s in there, but I, you know, I think Fed Chairs have generally not done that, because we just haven’t done it. It’s because we’re, you know, we have to put together the consensus on the Committee and present that consensus. So I wouldn’t talk about my individual one. And in terms of the pacing of it, I would just point out that that is—there’s seven remaining meetings this year. This isn’t something we discuss or debate or agree on. But there’s seven remaining meetings, and there’s seven rate hikes. I would add there’s also the shrinkage of the balance sheet, which, you people do the math different ways, but that might be the equivalent of another rate increase just from the runoff of the balance sheet. So I don’t—but I don’t know. We haven’t made any decisions on front-end loading or going steadily through the year. And, as I mentioned, you know, if you look at the SEP, a good number of participants do see more than seven or eight increases this year. And I can’t give you, I’m not going to try to give you a really specific test for what it would take to do that. But I will say this, that we’ll be And we’ll be going—each meeting is a live meeting. And if we conclude that it would be appropriate to raise interest rates more quickly, then we’ll do so.","Q&A","Press Conf","","246","2022-03"
"2022-03-16","So I just would say a couple things. We have the tools that we need, and we’re going to use them. And, as you can see, we have a plan over the course of this year to raise interest rates steadily and also to run off the balance sheet. We will take the necessary steps to ensure that high inflation does not become entrenched, while also supporting a strong labor market. And, as I mentioned, if we conclude that it would be appropriate to move more quickly, we’ll do so. I’ll leave it to others to make the judgment you asked for.","Q&A","Press Conf","","102","2022-03"

"2022-03-21","I believe that the historical record provides some grounds for optimism: Soft, or at least soft-ish, landings have been relatively common in U.S. monetary history.5In three episodes—in 1965, 1984, and 1994—the Fed raised the federal funds rate significantly in response to perceived overheating without precipitating a recession (figure 6).6In other cases, recessions chronologically followed the conclusion of a tightening cycle, but the recessions were not apparently due to excessive tightening of monetary policy.","General","Speech","N/A","73","2022-03"

"2022-05-04","So I guess I would say it this way: There’s a path. There’s a path by which we would be able to have demand moderate in the labor market and therefore have vacancies come down without unemployment going up, because vacancies are at such an extraordinarily high level. There’re 1.9 vacancies for every unemployed person, 11.5 million vacancies, 6 million unemployed people. So we haven’t been in that place on the vacancy, sort of the vacancy/unemployed curve, the Beveridge curve. We haven’t been at that sort of level of a ratio in the modern era. So, in principle, it seems as though by moderating demand, we could see vacancies come down and, as a result—and they could come down fairly significantly and, I think, put supply and demand at least closer together than they are. And that would give us a chance to get inflation down, get wages down, and then get inflation down without having to slow the economy and have a recession and have unemployment rise materially. So there’s a path to that. Now, I would say, I think we have a good chance to have a soft or softish landing or outcome, if you will. And I’ll give you a couple of reasons for that. One is, households and businesses are in very strong financial shape. You’re looking at, you know, excess savings on balance sheets—excess in the sense that they’re substantially larger than the prior trend. Businesses are in good financial shape. The labor market is, as I mentioned, very, very strong. And so it doesn’t seem to be anywhere close to a downturn. Therefore, the economy is strong and is well positioned to handle tighter monetary policy. So, but I’ll say, I do expect that this that’s what we’re going to do.","Q&A","Press Conf","","297","2022-05"
"2022-05-04","So, look, I think what you’ve seen is—really, I would say, in the middle of last fall—there was a time when our policy stance was still pretty much in sync with what the data were saying. If you remember, there were a couple of weak jobs reports. And inflation—month by month, inflation had come down till September, a few months in a row, stayed low. And then around the end of October, we got three or four really strong readings that just said, no, this is a much stronger economy. And by the way—then, with the restatement of the jobs numbers, it looked like the job market was much more even and stronger in the second half of the year. But that hadn’t happened yet. Anyway, we got an ECI reading—employment compensation, [employment cost] index reading—the Friday before the November meeting. Then we got a really strong jobs report. Then we got a really high CPI report. And so I think it became clear to the Committee that we needed to adjust and adapt. And we have. Ever since then, really ever since then, we’ve been adapting. We, you know—the Committee moved by the time of the December meeting to a median [in participants’ 2022 projections] of three rate increases, then to a median of seven increases at the March meeting. And that process is going on. And it’s clearly continuing. And that’s why I say—and I actually mentioned this at the March meeting—that no one should look at any single SEP as sort of a real resting place for 90 days, because we’re in a fast-evolving situation. And that’s what’s happened. You can see— unanimous vote today, of course. And I told you the guidance—that broad support on the adapting to the data and to the situation and using our tools to deal with it.","Q&A","Press Conf","","306","2022-05"
"2022-05-04","Well, so, as I mentioned, you can see places where the demand is substantially in excess of supply. And what you’re seeing as a result of that is prices going up and at unsustainable levels, levels that are not consistent with 2 percent inflation. And so what our tools do is that as we raise interest rates, demand moderates: it moves down. Interest rates, you know—businesses will invest a little bit less, consumers will spend a little bit less. That’s how it works. But, ultimately, getting those, getting supply and demand back, you know, back in balance, is what gives us 2 percent inflation, which is what gives the economy a footing where people can lead successful economic lives and not worry about inflation. I mean, so, yes, there may be some pain associated with getting back to that. But, you know, the big pain over time is in not dealing with inflation and allowing it to become entrenched.","Q&A","Press Conf","","159","2022-05"
"2022-05-04","No, I don’t. And a good example of why would be—in the fourth quarter of last year, as we started talking about tapering sooner and then raising rates this year, you saw financial markets reacting, you know, very appropriately. Not to bless any particular day’s measure, but the way financial markets, the forward rate curve has tightened in response to our guidance and our actions really amplifies our policy. It’s—monetary policy is working through expectations now, to a very large extent. We’ve only done two rate increases. But if And that’s all through the economy. People are feeling those higher rates already. And so that shows that the markets think that our forward guidance is credible. And I think we want to keep it that way.","Q&A","Press Conf","","126","2022-05"
"2022-05-04","So, why June 1? It was just, pick a date, you know, and that happened to be the date that we picked. It was—nothing magic about it. You know, it’s not going to have any macroeconomic significance over time. We just picked that. Sometimes we publish these calendars on the first day of the month, and that’s what we’re doing. I wouldn’t read anything into it. In terms of the effect, I mean, I would just stress how uncertain the effect balance sheet shrinkage compared to quantitative easing? And, you know, these are very uncertain. I really can’t be any clearer. There won’t be any clearer [estimates]. You know, people estimate that, broadly, on the path we’re on—and this will be taken, probably, too seriously—but sort of ¼ percent, one rate increase over the course of a year at this pace. But I would just say, with very wide uncertainty bands—very wide. We don’t really know. There are other estimates that are much smaller than that, by the way. And some of you may read about that. That’s kind of a mainstream estimate. We know that it is part of returning to more normal, more neutral financial conditions. And, you know, our strategy is to set up a plan and have it operate and really have, you know, have the interest rate be the active tool of monetary policy. In terms of speaking to the American people, so I feel like sometimes I just want to remind us, really, that that’s who we work for, and that it’s inflation that people are feeling all over the country. And it’s very important that they know that we know how painful it is and that we are working hard on fixing it. I thought it was quite important to do that. And so that was really the thinking behind that.","Q&A","Press Conf","","308","2022-05"
"2022-05-04","So I didn’t—if I said “necessary,” I meant to say “appropriate.” We’re not going to be erecting a high barrier for this. It’s more, if we think it’s appropriate. You know, the point is, we’re a very long way from neutral now. We’re moving there expeditiously, and we’ll continue to do so. And we can’t make that decision, really, today. The decision for about how high to go will be on the table to be made when we reach neutral. And, you know, I expect we’ll get there expeditiously, as I’ve mentioned. So it’s not that we don’t want to—making that decision today wouldn’t really mean anything. But I’ll say again, if we do believe that it’s appropriate to go to those levels, we won’t hesitate.","Q&A","Press Conf","","126","2022-05"
"2022-05-04","So I think it’s certainly possible that we’ll need to move policy to levels that we see as restrictive as opposed to just neutral. We can’t know that today. That decision is not in front of us today. If we do conclude that we need to do that, then we won’t hesitate to do it. I’ll say again, there’s no bright line, you know, that you’re stepping over. You’re really looking at what our policy stance is and what the market is forecasting for it. You’re looking at financial conditions and how that’s affecting the economy and making a judgment. You know, we won’t be arguing about whose model of the neutral rate is better than the other one. It’s much more about a practical application of our policy tools. And we’re absolutely prepared to do that. It—wouldn’t hesitate if that’s what it takes. So I am, of course—who isn’t an admirer of Paul Volcker? I shouldn’t be singled out in this respect. But I knew him just a little bit and have tremendous admiration for him. And I— But I would phrase it this way: He had the courage to do what he thought was the right thing. That’s what it was. It wasn’t a particular thing. It was that he always did—he always did—what he thought was the right thing. If you read his last autobiography, that really comes through. So that’s [what] the test is. It isn’t, will we do one particular thing? really. And so it’s really essential, particularly for the labor market. If you think about it, like if you look at the last cycle, we had a very, very—longest expansion cycle in our recorded history. In the last two, three years, you had the benefits of this tight labor market going to people in the lower quartiles. And it was, you know, racial, wealth, and income—not wealth, but income gaps were coming down, wage gaps. So it’s a really great thing. We’d all love to get back to that place. But to get back to anything like that place, you need price stability. So, basically, we’ve been hit by historically large inflationary shocks since the pandemic. This isn’t anything like regular business. This is, we have a pandemic, we have the highest unemployment, you know, in—since the Depression. Then we have this outsized response from fiscal policy and monetary policy. Then we have inflation. Then we have a war in Ukraine, which is cutting the commodity, you know, patch in half. And now we have these shutdowns in China. So it’s been a series of inflationary shocks that are really different from anything people have seen in 40 years. So we have to look through that and look at the economy that’s coming out the other side. And we need to somehow find price stability out of this. And it’s obviously going to be very challenging, I think, because you do have, you know, numerous supply shocks, which are famously difficult to deal with. So I guess that’s how I think about it.","Q&A","Press Conf","","509","2022-05"
"2022-05-04","You know, it’s really the Fed that has responsibility for price stability. And we take whatever arrives at the Fed in terms of fiscal activity, we take it as a given, and we don’t evaluate it—it’s not our job, really. We don’t have an oversight function there. And we look at it as our job, given all the factors that are happening, to try to sustain maximum employment and price stability. So if Congress or the Administration has ways to help with inflation, I would encourage that, but I’m not going to get into making recommendations or anything like that. It’s not, it’s really not our role—we need to stay in our lane and do our job. When we get inflation back under control, then maybe I can, you know, give other people advice [laughter]. Right now, we need to focus on, just focus on doing our job. And I’ll stick to that. Stick in our lane. colleagues have said that the rates will need to go above neutral into a restrictive territory to bring down inflation. One, do you agree with that? And, two, you’ve recently spoken in great praise of Paul Volcker, who had the courage to bring inflation down with recessions in the 1980s. And while it’s certainly not your desire—the soft landing is the big hope of everyone— would this FOMC have the courage to endure recessions to bring inflation down if that were the only way necessary?","Q&A","Press Conf","","242","2022-05"
"2022-05-04","So, and as I said, I think we have a good chance to restore price stability without a recession—without, you know, a severe downturn; without materially high, higher unemployment. And I mentioned the reasons for that. So I see a strong economy now. I see a very strong labor market, for example. Businesses can’t find the people to hire—they can’t people out of work. The issue will come that we don’t have precision surgical tools. We have, essentially, interest rates, the balance sheet, and forward guidance, and they’re famously blunt tools. They’re not capable of surgical precision. So I would agree. No one thinks this will be easy, no one thinks it’s straightforward, but there is certainly a plausible path to this, and I do think we’ve got a good chance to do that. And, you know, our job is not to rate the chances—it is to try to achieve it. So that’s what we’re doing. There are a range of opinions, though, and that’s only appropriate.","Q&A","Press Conf","","167","2022-05"
"2022-05-04","So the economy is doing fairly well. We expect growth to be solid this year. And we see, you know, household spending and business investment as fairly strong— and even in the first quarter, which was relatively slow on some other fronts. So, and the labor market—if you look at the labor market, for people who are out of work and looking, there are lots of job opportunities for—wages are moving up and at rates that haven’t been seen in quite a long time. So it’s a good time to be a worker looking to, you know, either change jobs or get a wage increase in your current job. So it’s a strong economy, and nothing about it suggests that it’s close to, or vulnerable to, a recession. Now, of course, given events around the world and fading fiscal policy effects and higher rates, you could see some slower economic activity. Certainly, it will not be—last year was an extraordinarily strong growth year as we recovered from the pandemic. As I mentioned, growth [was] over 5 percent. But most forecasters have growth this year at, you know, at a solid pace above 2 percent.","Q&A","Press Conf","","194","2022-05"
"2022-05-04","So, first, the first thing to say is that we understand. And some of us are old enough to have lived through high inflation, and many aren’t. But it’s very unpleasant. It’s just something people don’t—when they experience it for the first time, you’re paying more for the same thing. If you’re a normal economic person, then you probably don’t have that much extra to spend. And it’s immediately hitting your spending on groceries, on, you know, on gasoline, on energy, and things like that. So we understand the pain involved. So how do you get out of that? And it’s our job to make sure that inflation of that unpleasant, high nature doesn’t get entrenched in the economy. That’s what we’re here for, one of the main things we’re here for—perhaps the most fundamental thing we’re here for. And the way we do that is, we try to get supply and demand back in sync with each other, back in balance, so that the economy is under less stress and inflation will go down. Now, the process of getting there involves higher rates—so higher mortgage rates, higher borrowing rates, and things like that. So it’s not going to be pleasant either. But in the end, everyone is better off. Everyone— particularly people on fixed incomes and at the lower part of the income distribution are better off with stable prices. And so we need to do everything we can to restore stable prices. We’ll do it as quickly and effectively as we can. We think we have a good chance to do it without a significant increase in unemployment or, you know, a really sharp slowdown. But, ultimately, we think about the medium and longer term, and everyone will be better off if we can get this job done—the sooner, the better.","Q&A","Press Conf","","303","2022-05"
"2022-05-04","Okay, so in terms of the vacancies-to-unemployment ratio, we don’t have a goal in mind. There’s no specific number that we’re saying, “We’ve got to get to that.” matching functions in the labor markets are working. Because, you know, the longer these expansions go on, you can get very efficient with all of that, and the Beveridge curve shifts out. And that also tends to, you know, to help. So there isn’t a specific number. I will say we were— you know, I think, I think when we got to one-to-one in the, you know, in the late teens, we thought that was a pretty good number. But, again, we’re not shooting for any particular number. What we’d like to see is progress, but we’re not really looking at that. That’s an intermediate variable. We’re looking at wages, and we’re looking at, ultimately, inflation. So, you know, there are a bunch of channels through which policy works. You can think of it as, you know, interest-sensitive spending, and then you can think of another big one as asset values broadly. And, you know, there’re big models with, you know, a lot of different channels that are related to that. You know, we don’t focus on any one market—the equity market or the housing market—we focus on financial conditions broadly. So we wouldn’t be targeting any one market, as you suggest, for going up or down or taking a view on whether it’s at a good level or a bad level. We just would be looking at very broad measures of financial conditions—all the different financial conditions indexes, for example, which include equity. But they also include debt and other, many other things—credit spreads, things like that—too.","Q&A","Press Conf","","286","2022-05"
"2022-05-04","We don’t really see strong evidence of that yet, but that does not in any way make us comfortable. I think if you look at short-term inflation expectations, they’re quite elevated. And you can look at that and say, “Well, that’s because people expect inflation to come down.” And, in fact, inflation expectations [at longer horizons] come down fairly sharply. Longer-term inflation expectations have been reasonably stable but have moved up to—but only to levels where they were in 2014, by some measures. So you can look at that. And I think that’s a fair description of the picture. But it’s really about the risks. We don’t see a wage–price spiral. We see that companies have the ability to raise prices, and they’re doing that, but there have been price shocks. So I just think it takes you back to the basic point—was that we know we need to expeditiously move our policy rate up to ranges of more normal, neutral levels. And we need to look around and keep going if we don’t see that financial conditions have tightened adequately or that the economy is behaving in ways that suggest that we’re not where we need to be. So, again, you don’t see those things yet, but I would say there’s no basis for feeling comfortable about that. It’s a risk that we simply can’t run. We can’t allow a wage–price spiral to happen. And we can’t allow inflation expectations to become unanchored. It’s just something that we can’t allow to happen, and so we’ll look at it that way.","Q&A","Press Conf","","261","2022-05"
"2022-05-04","I don’t think the one month is—no. No. One month’s reading doesn’t tell us much. You know, we‘d want to see evidence that inflation is moving in a direction that gives us more comfort. As I said, we’ve got two months now where core inflation is a little lower, but we’re not looking at that as a reason to take some comfort. You know, I think we need to really see that our expectation is being fulfilled—that inflation, in fact, is under control and starting to come down. But, again, it’s not like we would stop. We would just go back to 25-basis-point increases. It’ll be a judgment call when these meetings arrive. But, again, our expectation is, if we see what we expect to see, then we would have 50-basis-point increases on the table at the next two meetings.","Q&A","Press Conf","","140","2022-05"
"2022-05-04","Sure. So a 75-basis-point increase is not something the Committee is actively considering. What we are doing is, we raised [the funds rate by] 50 basis points today. And we’ve said that, again, assuming that economic and financial conditions evolve in ways that are consistent with our expectations, there’s a broad sense on the Committee that additional 50- basis-point increases should be on the table for the next couple of meetings. So we’re going to make those decisions at the meetings, of course, and we’ll be paying close attention to the incoming data and the evolving outlook as well as to financial conditions. And, finally, of course, we will be communicating to the public about what our expectations will be as they evolve. So the test is really just as I laid it out—economic and financial conditions evolving broadly in line with expectations. And, you know, I think expectations are that we’ll start to see inflation, you know, flattening out—and not necessarily declining yet, but we’ll see more evidence. We’ve seen some evidence that core PCE inflation is perhaps either reaching a peak be a lot more information. I just think we want to see that information as we get there. It’s a very difficult environment to try to give forward guidance 60, 90 days in advance. There are just so many things that can happen in the economy and around the world. So, you know, we’re leaving ourselves room to look at the data and make a decision as we get there.","Q&A","Press Conf","","253","2022-05"
"2022-05-04","Thank you. So you’re right—3.6 percent unemployment is just about as low as it’s been in 50 years. And I would say that I expect, and Committee members generally expect, that we’ll get some additional participation. So people will be coming back into the labor force. We’ve seen that particularly among prime-age people. And that will, of course, tend to hold the unemployment rate up a little bit. I would also expect, though, that job creation will slow. Job creation has been, you know, more than half a million per month in recent months—very, very strong, particularly for this stage of the economy. And so we think— with fiscal policy less supportive, with monetary policy less supportive, we think that job creation will slow as well. So it is certainly possible that the unemployment would go down further. But so I would expect those to be relatively limited because of the additional supply and also just the slowing in job creation. Implications for inflation—really, the wages matter a fair amount for companies, particularly in the service sector. Wages are running high, the highest they’ve run in quite some time. And they are one good example, or good illustration, really, of how tight the labor market really is, the fact that wages are running at the highest level in many decades. And that’s because of an imbalance between supply and demand in the labor market. So we think through our policies—through further healing in the labor market, higher rates, for example, of vacancy filling and things like that, and more people coming back in—we’d like to think that supply and demand will come back into balance and that, therefore, wage inflation will moderate to still","Q&A","Press Conf","","284","2022-05"
"2022-05-04","Good afternoon. It’s nice to see everyone in person for the first time in a couple years. Before I go into the details of today’s meeting, I’d like to take this opportunity to speak directly to the American people. Inflation is much too high, and we understand the hardship it is causing, and we’re moving expeditiously to bring it back down. We have both the tools we need and the resolve that it will take to restore price stability on behalf of American families and businesses. The economy and the country have been through a lot over the past two years and have proved resilient. It is essential that we bring inflation down if we are to have a sustained period of strong labor market conditions that benefit all. From the standpoint of our Congressional mandate to promote maximum employment and price stability, the current picture is plain to see: The labor market is extremely tight, and inflation is much too high. Against this backdrop, today the FOMC raised its policy interest rate by ½ percentage point and anticipates that ongoing increases in the target rate for the federal funds rate will be appropriate. In addition, we are beginning the process of significantly reducing the size of our balance sheet. I’ll have more to say about today’s monetary policy actions after briefly reviewing economic developments. After expanding at a robust 5½ percent pace last year, overall economic activity edged down in the first quarter. Underlying momentum remains strong, however, as the decline largely reflected swings in inventories and net exports—two volatile categories whose movements last quarter likely carry little signal for future growth. Indeed, household spending and business fixed investment continued to expand briskly. rate hit a post-pandemic, and near-five-decade, low of 3.6 percent. Improvements in labor market conditions have been widespread, including for workers at the lower end of the wage distribution as well as for African Americans and Hispanics. Labor demand is very strong, and, while labor force participation has increased somewhat, labor supply remains subdued. Employers are having difficulties filling job openings, and wages are rising at the fastest pace in many years. Inflation remains well above our longer-run goal of 2 percent. Over the 12 months ending in March, total PCE prices rose 6.6 percent; excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 5.2 percent. Aggregate demand is strong, and bottlenecks and supply constraints are limiting how quickly production can respond. Disruptions to supply have been larger, and longer lasting, than anticipated, and price pressures have spread to a broader range of goods and services. The surge in prices of crude oil and other commodities that resulted from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is creating additional upward pressure on inflation. And COVID-related lockdowns in China are likely to further exacerbate supply chain disruptions as well. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is causing tremendous loss and hardship, and our thoughts and sympathies are with the people of Ukraine. Our job is to consider the implications for the","Opening Statement","Press Conf","","501","2022-05"
"2022-05-04","So unemployment rates for all racial groups have come down a lot and are now much closer to where they were before the pandemic hit. So that’s one thing I would say. And that’s important. But the bigger point is this: I do not, at this time, see the two sides of the mandate as in tension. I don’t, because you can see that the labor market is out of balance. You can see that there’s a labor shortage. There aren’t enough people to fill these job openings. And companies can’t hire, and wages are moving up at levels that would not, over time, be consistent with 2 percent inflation over time. And, of course, everyone loves to see wages go up. And it’s a great thing, but you want them to go up at a sustainable level, because these wages are, to some extent, being eaten up by inflation. So, what that really means is, to get the kind of labor market we really want to get, we really want to have a labor market that serves all Americans, especially the people in the lower-income part of the distribution, especially them. To do that, you’ve got to have price stability. And we’ve got to get back to price stability so that we can have a labor market where people’s wages aren’t being eaten up by inflation and where we can have a long expansion, too. That’s—the good things you can have, as we have. We’ve had—several of the longest expansions in","Q&A","Press Conf","","252","2022-05"

"2022-06-15","Right. So, what we want to see is a series of declining monthly readings for inflation, and we’d like to see inflation headed down. But, you know—and right now, our policy rate is well below neutral, right? So, soon enough, we’ll have our policy rate— let’s assume the world works out about like the SEP says: The policy rate will be up where we think it should be. And then the question would be: Do you slow down? Does it make you— you’ll be making these judgments about, is it appropriate now to slow down—from 50 to 25, let’s say—or speed up? So that’s the kind of thinking we’ll be doing, and, again, we’re looking—ultimately, we’re not going to declare victory until we see a series of these, really see convincing evidence, compelling evidence, that inflation is coming down. And that’s what I mean by—that’s what it would take for us to say, “Okay, we think this job is done.” Because we saw—and, frankly, we saw last year—inflation came down over the course of the summer and then turned right around and went back up. So I think we’re going to be careful about declaring victory. But our—again, the implementation of our policy is going to be flexible and sensitive to incoming data.","Q&A","Press Conf","","213","2022-06"
"2022-06-15","Again, I think that—I do think that our objective, and this is what’s reflected in the SEP, but our objective, really, is to bring inflation down to 2 percent while the labor market remains strong. I think that what’s becoming more clear is that many factors that we don’t control are going to play a very significant role in deciding whether that’s possible or not. And there I’m thinking, of course, of commodity prices, the war in Ukraine, supply chain getting more challenging because of these external forces—and that path is to move demand down, and you have a lot of surplus demand. Take, for example, in the labor market. So you have two job vacancies, essentially, for every person actively seeking a job, and that has led to a real imbalance in wage negotiating. You could get to a place where that ratio was at a more normal level, and you wouldn’t—you would expect to see those wage pressures move back down to a level where people are still getting healthy wage increases, real wage increases, but at a level that’s consistent with 2 percent inflation. So that’s a possibility. And you could say the same thing about some of the product markets where there’s just excess capacity and really where the strong demand has gone into—sorry, where they’re capacity constrained, right? So you have, effectively, what we think of as a vertical supply curve or close to it. So demand comes in, and it’s very strong, and it shows up in higher prices—not higher quantities, not more cars, because they can’t make the cars because they don’t have the semiconductors. So in principle, that could work in reverse. When demand comes down, you could see—and it’s not guaranteed—but you could see prices coming down more than the typical economic relationships that you see in the textbooks would suggest, because of the unusual situation we’re in on the supply side. So there’s a pathway there. It is not going to be easy, and there—again, it’s our objective, but, as I mentioned, it’s going to depend to some extent on factors we don’t control.","Q&A","Press Conf","","354","2022-06"
"2022-06-15","We’re not—again, we’re not, we don’t seek to put people out of work, of course. We never think, “Too many people are working, and fewer people need to have jobs.” But we also think that you really cannot have the kind of labor market we want without price stability. And we have to go back and establish price stability so we can have that kind of labor market, and that’s a labor market where workers are getting wage increases—maybe the workers at the lower end of the spectrum are getting the biggest wage increases, as they were before the pandemic—where participation is high, where there’s lots of job opportunities, where it’s just a really—I mean, the labor market we had before the pandemic was—that’s what we want to get back to. And you see disparities between various groups at historic lows. We’d love to get back to that place. But, to get there—it’s not going to happen with the levels of inflation","Q&A","Press Conf","","162","2022-06"
"2022-06-15","To take your second question first, yes. I mean, I think we’re— again, we’re going, we’re resolved to take this on, but we’re going to be flexible in the implementation of it. Sorry—and your [first] question was [about] guidance. So, again, the overall exercise is that we try to be—provide as much clarity about our policy intentions as we can, because we think that makes monetary policy work better. There’s always a tradeoff, because you have to live with that guidance, and so you do it, and it helps a lot of the time. I, significantly through the expectations channel, as we’ve made it clear what our plans are. So I think that’s been a very healthy thing to be happening. And I would hope that our—it’s always going to be—any guidance that we give is always going to be subject to things working out about as we expect. And, in this particular situation, you know, we’re looking for something specific, and that is progress on inflation. We want to see progress. We want to see—inflation can’t go down until it flattens out, and that’s what we’re looking to see. And if we don’t see that, then that’s the kind of thing that will—even if we don’t see progress for a longer period, that could cause us to react. But we will. Soon enough, we will be seeing some progress at some point. And we’ll react [as] appropriate to that, too. But I would like to think, though, that our guidance is still credible, but it’s always going to be conditional on what happens. This is an unusual situation, to get, you know, some data late in, during blackout, pretty close to—very close to our meeting. Very unusual to [have] one that would actually change the outcome. So I’ve only seen—in my 10-years-plus here at the Fed, I’ve only seen something like that, even close to that, one or two times. So I don’t think it’s something that’ll come up a great deal.","Q&A","Press Conf","","333","2022-06"
"2022-06-15","So you’re right. In the SEP, we have unemployment going up to 4 point—the median is 4.1 percent—of course, [there is] a range of actual forecasts. And I would characterize that, if you were to get inflation down to, you know, on its way down to 2 percent and the unemployment rate went up to 4.1 percent, that’s still a historically low level. We hadn’t seen—we hadn’t seen rates, unemployment rates below 4 percent until a couple years ago for—we’d seen it for, like, one year in the last 50. So the idea that—3.6 percent is historically low in the last century. So a 4.1 percent unemployment rate with inflation well on its way to 2 percent—I think that would be—I think that would be a successful outcome. So we’re not looking to have a higher unemployment rate. But I would say that I would certainly look at that as a successful outcome.","Q&A","Press Conf","","153","2022-06"
"2022-06-15","We’re going to—I’ll just say, we’re going to react to the incoming data and appropriately, I think. So I wouldn’t want to put a number on what that might be. The main thing is to get rates up, and then pretty soon, we’ll be in an area where we’re—I think as you get closer to the end of the year, you’re in a range where you’ve got restrictive policy, which is appropriate. Forty-year highs in inflation—we think that policy is going to need to be restrictive, and we don’t know how restrictive. So I think that’s how we’ll take it.","Q&A","Press Conf","","100","2022-06"
"2022-06-15","So, as you know, we always aim to provide as much clarity as we can about our policy intentions subject to the inherent uncertainty in the economic outlook, because we think monetary policy is more effective when market participants understand how policy will evolve, when they understand our objective function, our reaction function. And in the current highly unusual circumstances with inflation well above our goal, we think it’s helpful to provide even more clarity than usual—again, subject to uncertainty in the outlook. And I think over the course of this year, financial markets have responded and have, generally, shown that they understand the path we’re laying out. Of course, it remains data dependent. it was subject to the economy performing about in line with expectations. I also said that if the economy performed—if data came in worse than expected, then we would consider moving even more aggressively. So we got the CPI data and also some data on inflation expectations late last week, and we thought for a while, and we thought, well, this is the appropriate thing to do. So then the question is, what do you do? And do you wait six weeks to do it at the next meeting? And I think the answer is, that’s not where we are with this. So we decided we needed to go ahead, and so we did. And that’s really—that’s really how we made the decision.","Q&A","Press Conf","","237","2022-06"
"2022-06-15","I think it’s certainly in the range of plausible numbers. I think we’ll know when we get there really. I mean, honestly, though, that would be—you would have positive real rates, I think, and inflation coming down by then. I think you’d have positive real rates across the [yield] curve. I think that the neutral rate is pretty low these days. So I would think it would, but you know what? We’re going to find that out empirically. We’re not going to be completely model driven about this. We’re going to be looking at this, keeping our eyes open, and reacting to incoming data both on financial conditions and on what’s happening in the economy. your policy to work through expectations. And now, obviously, this decision was something quite different from how you and almost all of your colleagues had set those expectations during the intermeeting period. And I know you just said that what changed was really the inflation data—the inflation expectations data. But I’m wondering, on the inflation expectations data, was there something you saw that was unsettling enough to risk eroding the credibility of your verbal guidance by doing something so different from what you had “socialized” before?","Q&A","Press Conf","","201","2022-06"
"2022-06-15","Sure. So the question really is, how high does the rate really need to go? And this is—the estimates on the Committee are in that range of 3½ to 4 percent. And how do you think about that? Well, you can think about the longer-run neutral rate, you can compare it to that, and we think that’s in the mid-2s. You can look, frankly, at broader financial conditions. You can look at asset prices, you can look at the effect they’re having on the economy, rates, asset prices, credit spreads—all of those things go into that. You can also look at the yield curve and ask, all along the yield curve, where is the policy rate? So for much of the yield curve now, real rates are positive. That’s not true at the short end. At the short end of the yield curve in the early years, you don’t have real—you have negative rates still. affects the economy. We have, of course, ways—rigorous ways to think about it, but, ultimately, it comes down to, do we think financial conditions are in a place where they’re having the desired effect on the economy? And that desired affect is, we’d like to see demand moderating. Demand is very hot still in the economy. We’d like to see the labor market getting better in balance between supply and demand, and that can happen [as a result of developments coming] both from supply and demand. Right now, there’s—demand is substantially higher than available supply, though, so we feel that there’s a role for us in moderating demand. Those are the things we can affect with our policy tools. There are many things we can’t affect, and those would be, you know, the things—the commodity price issues that we’re having around the world due to the war in Ukraine and the fallout from that, and also just all of the supply-side things that are still pushing upward on inflation. So that’s really how I think—how I think about it.","Q&A","Press Conf","","334","2022-06"
"2022-06-15","Sure. So if you take a step back, what we’re looking for is compelling evidence that inflationary pressures are abating and that inflation is moving back down. And we’d like to see that in the form of a series of declining monthly inflation readings— that’s what we’re looking for. And, by this point, we had actually been expecting to see clear signs of at least inflation flattening out and, ideally, beginning to decline. We’ve said that we’d be data dependent, focused on incoming data, highly attentive to inflation risks—the things that I mentioned to Howard moments ago. So contrary to expectations, inflation again surprised to the upside. Indicators—some indicators of inflation expectations have risen, and projections of [inflation] this year have is this: We’ve been moving rates up expeditiously to more normal levels, and over the course of the seven months since we pivoted and began moving in this direction, we’ve seen financial conditions tighten, and appropriately so. But the federal funds rate, even after this move, is at 1.6 percent. So, again, the Committee is moving rates up expeditiously to more normal levels, and we came to the view that we’d like to do a little more front-end loading on that. So I think that the SEP gives you the levels that people think are appropriate at given points in time. This was really about the speed in which we would get there. So, as I mentioned, 75 basis points today—I said the next meeting could well be about a decision between 50 and 75. That would put us, at the end of the July meeting, in that range—in that more normal range, and that’s a desirable place to be, because you begin to have more optionality there about the speed with which you would proceed going forward. Just talking about the SEP for a second: What it really says is that Committee participants widely would like to see policy at a modestly restricted—restrictive level at the end of this year. And that’s six months from now, and so much data [can accrue] and so much can happen, so remember how highly uncertain this is. But so that is generally a range of 3 to 3½ percent. That’s where people are, and that’s what they want to see, knowing what they know now and understanding that we need to be—we need to show resolve but also be flexible [in responding] to incoming data as we see it. If things are better, we don’t need to do that much, and if they’re not, then we either do that much or possibly even more. But in any case, it will be very data dependent. Then you’re looking at next year, and what you’re seeing is, people see more—a bit more tightening and a range of maybe 3½ to 4 percent. And that’s generally what meeting, and that’s what we did.","Q&A","Press Conf","","479","2022-06"
"2022-06-15","Good afternoon. I will begin with one overarching message: We at the Fed understand the hardship that high inflation is causing. We are strongly committed to bringing inflation back down, and we’re moving expeditiously to do so. We have both the tools we need and the resolve that it will take to restore price stability on behalf of American families and businesses. The economy and the country have been through a lot over the past two and a half years and have proved resilient. It is essential that we bring inflation down if we are to have a sustained period of strong labor market conditions that benefit all. From the standpoint of our congressional mandate to promote maximum employment and price stability, the current picture is plain to see: The labor market is extremely tight, and inflation is much too high. Against this backdrop, today the Federal Open Market Committee raised its policy interest rate by ¾ percentage point and anticipates that ongoing increases in that rate will be appropriate. In addition, we are continuing the process of significantly reducing the size of our balance sheet. I’ll have more to say about today’s monetary policy actions after briefly reviewing economic developments. Overall economic activity edged down in the first quarter, as unusually sharp swings in inventories and net exports more than offset continued strong underlying demand. Recent indicators suggest that real GDP growth has picked up this quarter, with consumption spending remaining strong. In contrast, growth in business fixed investment appears to be slowing, and activity in the housing sector looks to be softening, in part reflecting higher mortgage rates. The tightening in financial conditions that we’ve seen in recent months should continue to temper growth and help bring demand into better balance with supply. As shown in our Summary of The labor market has remained extremely tight, with the unemployment rate near a 50-year low, job vacancies at historical highs, and wage growth elevated. Over the past three months, employment rose by an average of 408,000 jobs per month, down from the average pace seen earlier in the year but still robust. Improvements in labor market conditions have been widespread, including for workers at the lower end of the wage distribution as well as for African Americans and Hispanics. Labor demand is very strong, while labor supply remains subdued, with the labor force participation rate little changed since January. FOMC participants expect supply and demand conditions in the labor market to come into better balance, easing the upward pressures on wages and prices. The median projection in the SEP for the unemployment rate rises somewhat over the next few years, moving from 3.7 percent at the end of this year to 4.1 percent in 2024, levels that are noticeably above the March projections. Inflation remains well above our longer-run goal of 2 percent. Over the 12 months ending in April, total PCE prices rose 6.3 percent; excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core prices rose 4.9 percent. In May, the 12-month change in the consumer price index came in above expectations at 8.6 percent, and the change in the core CPI was 6 percent. Aggregate demand is strong, supply constraints have been larger and longer lasting than anticipated, and price pressures have spread to a broad range of goods and services. The surge in prices of crude oil and other commodities that resulted from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is boosting prices for gasoline and food and is creating additional upward pressure on inflation. And COVID-related lockdowns in China are likely to exacerbate supply chain disruptions. FOMC participants have revised up their projections for inflation this year, particularly for total continue to see risks to inflation as weighted to the upside. The Fed’s monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people. My colleagues and I are acutely aware that high inflation imposes significant hardship, especially on those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation. We are highly attentive to the risks high inflation poses to both sides of our mandate, and we are strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent objective. Against the backdrop of the rapidly evolving economic environment, our policy has been adapting, and it will continue to do so. At today’s meeting, the Committee raised the target range for the federal funds rate by ¾ percentage point, resulting in a 1½ percentage point increase in the target range so far this year. The Committee reiterated that it anticipates that ongoing increases in the target range will be appropriate. And we are continuing the process of significantly reducing the size of our balance sheet—which plays an important role in firming the stance of monetary policy. Coming out of our last meeting in May, there was a broad sense on the Committee that a ½ percentage point increase in the target range should be considered at this meeting if economic and financial conditions evolved in line with expectations. We also stated that we were highly attentive to inflation risks and that we would be nimble in responding to incoming data and the evolving outlook. Since then, inflation has again surprised to the upside, some indicators of inflation expectations have risen, and projections for inflation this year have been revised up notably. In response to these developments, the Committee decided that a larger increase in the inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2 percent. As shown in the SEP, the median projection for the appropriate level of the federal funds rate is 3.4 percent at the end of this year, 1.5 percentage points higher than projected in March and 0.9 percentage point above the median estimate of its longer-run value. The median projection rises further to 3.8 percent at the end of next year and declines to 3.4 percent in 2024, still above the median longer-run value. Of course, these projections do not represent a Committee plan or decision, and no one knows with any certainty where the economy will be a year or more from now. Over coming months, we will be looking for compelling evidence that inflation is moving down, consistent with inflation returning to 2 percent. We anticipate that ongoing rate increases will be appropriate; the pace of those changes will continue to depend on the incoming data and the evolving outlook for the economy. Clearly, today’s 75 basis point increase is an unusually large one, and I do not expect moves of this size to be common. From the perspective of today, either a 50 basis point or a 75 basis point increase seems most likely at our next meeting. We will, however, make our decisions meeting by meeting, and we will continue to communicate our thinking as clearly as we can. Our overarching focus is using our tools to bring inflation back down to our 2 percent goal and to keep longer-term inflation expectations well anchored. Making appropriate monetary policy in this uncertain environment requires a recognition that the economy often evolves in unexpected ways. Inflation has obviously surprised to the upside over the past year, and further surprises could be in store. We therefore will need to be nimble in responding to incoming data and the evolving outlook. And we will strive to avoid stability. The American economy is very strong and well positioned to handle tighter monetary policy. To conclude: We understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission. We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum-employment and price-stability goals. Thank you.

"2022-06-15","Not trying to induce a recession now. Let’s be clear about that. We’re trying to achieve 2 percent inflation consistent with a strong labor market. That’s what we’re trying to do. So let me talk about that sentence. Clearly, it’s our goal to bring about 2 percent inflation while keeping the labor market strong, right? And that’s kind of what the SEP says. The SEP has inflation getting down to 2, a little above 2 percent in 2024, with unemployment at 4.1 percent. And this is a strong labor market—this is a good labor market. And, as I mentioned, there are pathways to do it. But those pathways have become much more challenging due to factors that are not under our control. Again, thinking here of the fallout from the war in Ukraine, which has brought a spike in prices of energy, food, fertilizer, industrial chemicals, and also just the supply chains more broadly, which have been larger and longer lasting than anticipated. So the sentence that we deleted said that we believe that appropriate monetary policy, effectively alone, can bring about the result of 2 percent inflation with a strong labor market. And so much of it is really not down to monetary policy. It just didn’t—the","Q&A","Press Conf","","208","2022-06"
"2022-06-15","So if you look at a broad range of inflation expectations—so you’ve got the public, you’ve got surveys of the public and of experts, and you’ve also got market based. And I think if you look across that broad range of data, what you see is that expectations are still in the place, very much in the place, where short-term inflation is going to be high but comes down sharply over the next couple of years. And that’s really where inflation expectations are. And also, as you get away from this episode, they get back down close to 2 percent. And so this is really very important to us—that that remain the case. And I think if you look for most measures, most of the time, that’s what you see. If we even see a couple of indicators that bring that into question, we take that very seriously. We do not take this for granted—we take it very seriously. So the preliminary Michigan [survey] reading—it’s a preliminary reading; it might be revised—nonetheless, it was quite eye-catching, and we noticed that. We also noticed that the index of common inflation expectations at the Board has moved up after being pretty flat for a long time, so we’re watching that, and we’re thinking, “this is something we need to take seriously.” And that is one of the factors, as I mentioned—one of the factors in our deciding to move ahead with 75 basis points today was what we saw in inflation expectations. We’re","Q&A","Press Conf","","251","2022-06"
"2022-06-15","Well, yeah, I think you’ve seen—again, we’ve been expecting progress, and we didn’t get that. We got sort of the opposite. So I also think the situation, really—since the consequences of the Ukraine war become more and more clear, what you’re seeing is the situation getting more difficult. And you look around the world—I mean, lots of countries are—lots of countries are looking at inflation of 10 percent, and it’s largely due to commodities prices. But all over the world, you’re seeing these effects. And so—and we’re seeing them here: gas prices at all-time highs, and things like that. That’s not something we can do something about. So that is really—and, by the way, headline inflation, headline inflation is important for expectations. People—the public’s expectations, why would they be distinguishing between core inflation and headline inflation? Core inflation is something we [on the Committee] think about because it is a better predictor of future inflation. But headline inflation is what people experience. They don’t know what core is. Why would they? They have no reason to. So that’s—expectations are very much at risk due to high headline inflation. So it’s become—the environment has become more difficult, clearly, in the last four or five months, and hence the need for the policy actions that we took today. Hence our resolution to get rates up and, ultimately, get them to where we think they need to be in coming months. market by falling and then revisions to the previous months were down.

"2022-06-15","So the—we’re responsible for inflation in the law. And inflation means headline inflation. So that’s our ultimate goal. We, of course, like all central banks do, look very, very carefully at core inflation because it is—it’s a much better predictor, and it’s much—it’s a much better predictor of where inflation is going, and it’s also more relevant to our tools. As I mentioned, the parts that don’t go into core are mostly outside the scope of our tools, so we look at that. But it’s—the current situation is particularly difficult because of what I mentioned about expectations. We can’t affect, really—I mean, the energy prices are set by global commodity prices. And most of food—not all of it, but most food prices are pretty heavily influenced by global commodity prices, too. Also other things. So we can’t really have much of an effect. But we have to be mindful of the potential effect on inflation expectations [coming] from headline [inflation readings]. So it’s a very difficult situation to be in, and we— again, we can’t do much about the difference between [headline and core inflation rates due to] the elements that make up headline that are not in core.","Q&A","Press Conf","","199","2022-06"

"2022-06-15","So I think the role that we can play—maybe the way to get at this is to say that the role that we can play is around demand, right? And we’ll be able to see—the areas that we can affect are those associated with excess demand, and we’ll be able to see our effect on, for example, job openings in real time. And that would tell us what’s—that would tell us about wages. Wages are not principally responsible for the inflation that we’re seeing, but, going forward, they would be very important, particularly in the service sector. Sorry, I’m not sure I’m getting to your question.","Q&A","Press Conf","","106","2022-06"
"2022-06-15","There’s always a risk of going too far or going not far enough, and it’s going to be a very difficult judgment to make, or maybe not—maybe it’ll be really clear. But we’re—and we’re quite mindful of the dangers. But I will say, the worst mistake we could make would be to fail, which—it’s not an option. We have to restore price stability. We really do, because everything—it’s the bedrock of the economy. If you don’t have price stability, the economy’s really not going to work the way it’s supposed to. It won’t work for people—their wages will be eaten up. So we want to get the job done. This inflation happened relatively recently. We don’t think that it’s affecting expectations in any kind of fundamental way. We don’t think that we’re seeing a wage–price spiral. We think that the public generally sees us as very likely to be successful in getting inflation down to 2 percent, and that’s critical. It’s absolutely key to the whole thing that we sustain that confidence. So that’s how we’re thinking about it.","Q&A","Press Conf","","179","2022-06"
"2022-06-15","So, clearly, people don’t like inflation—a lot. And many people are experiencing it, really, for the first time, because we haven’t had anything like this kind of inflation in 40 years. And it’s really something people don’t like. And they’re experiencing that, determined to do what we can to get inflation back down. So that’s really what we’re saying. We’re not—I’m not—clearly, it’s an incredibly unpopular thing, and it’s very painful for people. I guess what I’m saying is, the question, the really critical question from the perspective of doing our job is making sure that the public does have confidence that we have the tools and will use them and they do work to bring inflation back down over time. It will take some time, we think, to get inflation back down, but we will do that.","Q&A","Press Conf","","138","2022-06"
"2022-06-15","So, as I mentioned, I think, in my opening statement, inflation has started—it started off in quite narrow, very directly pandemic-related areas, and it’s spread now broadly across the economy and into the services sector as well. It was really in the goods sector at the beginning. And, particularly, you’re seeing in travel now, if you’ve flown on a plane lately—planes are very full, and plane tickets are very expensive. Some of that will be pass- through of energy prices, but it’s—so you’re experiencing services inflation. Shelter inflation is high. So the question—and then you see the Cleveland measure going up, and many other measures are going up. So it’s a time when we’re not seeing progress and we want to see be, in the thinking of the Committee, somewhere in the range of 3 to 3½ percent by year-end. And then after that, you see what the rest of the SEP says. So I hope that’s responsive to your question.","Q&A","Press Conf","","161","2022-06"
"2022-06-15","So I think what’s in the SEP would certainly meet that test. If you see—you’re looking at getting back down to almost a 2 percent inflation by 2024, and the unemployment rate is still as low as 4.1 percent. That would be—I would call that as meeting that test. Do I still think that we can do that? I do. I think there’s—I think there’s—I don’t want to be the handicapper here. I just—that is our objective, and I do think it’s possible. Like I said, though, I think that events of the last few months have raised the degree of difficulty, created great challenges. And, again, the answer to the question, can we still do it—there’s a much bigger chance now that it’ll depend on factors that we don’t control, which is, fluctuations and spikes in commodity prices could wind up taking that option out of our hands. So we just don’t know, but we’re focused on—very, very focused on getting inflation back down to 2 percent, which we think is essential for the benefit of the public and also to put us on a path back to a sustainably strong labor market like the one we had before the pandemic.","Q&A","Press Conf","","202","2022-06"
"2022-06-15","So we’re, of course, watching very, very carefully for that and looking at the retail—the big store numbers and all that kind of thing. And so I—but I think the fair summary of what we see is, you see continuing shifts in consumption, you see some things getting—sales going down, but overall spending is very strong. The consumer’s in really good shape financially. They’re spending. There’s no sign of a broader slowdown that I can see in the economy. People are talking about it a lot—consumer confidence is very low. That’s probably related to gas prices and also just stock prices to some extent for other people. But that’s what we’re seeing. We’re not seeing a broad slowdown. We see job growth slowing, but it’s still at quite robust levels. We see the economy slowing a bit but still growth levels—healthy growth levels.","Q&A","Press Conf","","143","2022-06"
"2022-06-15","Sure. So, as I mentioned, financial conditions have tightened over the last seven months, and that’s a good thing, we think. But the federal funds rate, even after this increase, is at 1.6 percent. So it’s hard to see how that is too high of a rate. And even if we did another—so we’re going to get here by the end of the summer, somewhere in the 2s probably. Still, that’s still a low rate. So that’s not a rate that is calculated to bring a recession on. And we’ll—by then, we’ll have seen a whole lot more data. As I mentioned a couple times, the Committee’s views are around a modestly restrictive stance, which will be in the 3 to 3½ percent range by the end of this year, but that’s conditioned on that being the appropriate thing to do. If we see data going in a different direction, it’ll be reflected in our policy, as you see today. We’ll be watching—if things go in a direction we don’t expect, then we’re going to adapt. And I would say, this is a highly uncertain environment—extraordinarily uncertain environment. So, again, we’ll be determined and resolved, but flexible.","Q&A","Press Conf","","197","2022-06"
"2022-06-15","Sure. So rates were very low—a good place to start is that rates were very, very low for quite a while because of the pandemic and the need to do everything we could more normal, or above, levels. So, in the meantime, while rates were low and while demand was really high, obviously demand for housing changed from wanting to live in urban areas to some extent to living in single-family homes in the suburbs, famously. And so the demand was just suddenly much higher. And we saw prices moving up very, very strongly for the last couple of years. So that changes now, and rates have moved up—we’re well aware that mortgage rates have moved up a lot—and you’re seeing a changing housing market. We’re watching it to see what will happen. How much will it really affect residential investment? Not really sure. How much will it affect housing prices? Not really sure. It’s—I mean, obviously, we’re watching that quite carefully. You would think over time—I mean, so there’s a tremendous amount of supply in the housing market of unfinished homes, and as those come on line—whereas the supply of finished homes, inventory of finished homes that are for sale, is incredibly low, historically low. So it’s still a very tight market. So prices may keep going up for a while even in a world where rates are up. So it’s a complicated situation. We watch it very carefully. I would say if you’re a homebuyer, somebody or a young person looking to buy a home, you need a bit of a reset. We need to get back to a place where supply and demand are back together and where inflation is down low again and mortgage rates are low again. So this will be a process whereby we—ideally, we do our work in a way that the housing market settles in a new place and housing availability and credit availability are at appropriate levels. So thank you very much.","Q&A","Press Conf","","331","2022-06"

"2022-06-15","So, of course, we’ve been looking very carefully and hard at why inflation picked up so much more than expected last year and why it proved so persistent. We— it’s hard to overstate the extent of interest we have in that question morning, noon, and night. But you have to understand the context. For—really, the context is this: For decades before the pandemic and the reopening, you had a world where inflation was dominated by disinflationary forces such as declining population or aging demographics, let’s call it that, globalization enabled by technology, other factors, low productivity. So and that’s how all the models work is, decades and decades of data—they look at that. It’s a very flat Philips curve world, and the supply shocks tend to be transient, right? So we have now experienced an extraordinary series of shocks, if you think about it: the pandemic, the response, the reopening, inflation, followed by the war in Ukraine, followed by shutdowns in China—the war in Ukraine potentially having effects for years here. So we’re aware that a different set of forces are driving the economy—we have been, obviously, for quite a while. But this is a different—these forces are different. Inflation is behaving differently, and, in our thinking, it really is a question of very strong demand. But you couldn’t get this kind of inflation without a change on the supply side, which is there for anybody to see, which is these blockages and shortages and people dropping out of the labor force and things like that. So that’s how we’re looking at it. And we’ve done a lot of work internally on, and thinking about, what all that means. You don’t—the thing is, you don’t know whether those forces are—to what extent are they going to be sustained? In other words, will we go back to a world where it looks a little more like the and sort of there’s a “new normal,” and things settle down. But, honestly, we don’t know what that’s going to be. In the meantime, we have to find price stability in this new world and maximum employment in this new world where, clearly, inflationary forces are—you’re seeing them everywhere. Again, if you look around the world at where inflation levels are, it’s absolutely extraordinary. It’s not just here. In fact, we’re sort of in the middle of the pack, although I think we have, of course, a different kind of inflation than other people have, partly because our economy is stronger and more highly recovered. So that’s what we’re doing. We’ve done a lot of introspection and work on that and—sorry, on QT, we’ve communicated really clearly to the markets about what we’re going to do there. Markets seem to be okay with it. We’re phasing in—Treasury [security] issuance is down quite a lot, quite a lot from where it’s been, so I have no reason to think—markets are forward looking, and they see this coming. I have no reason to think it will lead to illiquidity and problems. It seems to be kind of understood and accepted at this point.","Q&A","Press Conf","","517","2022-06"

"2022-07-27","Good afternoon. My colleagues and I are strongly committed to bringing inflation back down, and we’re moving expeditiously to do so. We have both the tools we need and the resolve it will take to restore price stability on behalf of American families and businesses. The economy and the country have been through a lot over the past two and a half years and have proved resilient. It is essential that we bring inflation down to our 2 percent goal if we are to have a sustained period of strong labor market conditions that benefit all. From the standpoint of our congressional mandate to promote maximum employment and price stability, the current picture is plain to see: The labor market is extremely tight, and inflation is much too high. Against this backdrop, today the FOMC raised its policy interest rate by ¾ of a percentage point and anticipates that ongoing increases in the target range for the federal funds rate will be appropriate. In addition, we are continuing the process of significantly reducing the size of our balance sheet. And I’ll have more to say about today’s monetary policy actions after briefly reviewing economic developments. Recent indicators of spending and production have softened. Growth in consumer spending has slowed significantly, in part reflecting lower real disposable income and tighter financial conditions. Activity in the housing sector has weakened, in part reflecting higher mortgage rates. And after a strong increase in the first quarter, business fixed investment also looks to have declined in the second quarter. Despite these developments, the labor market has remained extremely tight, with the unemployment rate near a 50-year low, job vacancies near historical highs, and wage growth elevated. Over the past three months, employment rose by an average of 375,000 jobs per wage distribution as well as for African Americans and Hispanics. Labor demand is very strong, while labor supply remains subdued, with the labor force participation rate little changed since January. Overall, the continued strength of the labor market suggests that underlying aggregate demand remains solid. Inflation remains well above our longer-run goal of 2 percent. Over the 12 months ending in May, total PCE prices rose 6.3 percent; excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 4.7 percent. In June, the 12-month change in the consumer price index came in above expectations at 9.1 percent, and the change in the core CPI was 5.9 percent. Notwithstanding the recent slowdown in overall economic activity, aggregate demand appears to remain strong, supply constraints have been larger and longer lasting than anticipated, and price pressures are evident across a broad range of goods and services. Although prices for some commodities have turned down recently, the earlier surge in prices of crude oil and other commodities that resulted from Russia’s war on Ukraine has boosted prices for gasoline and food, creating additional upward pressure on inflation. The Fed’s monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people. My colleagues and I are acutely aware that high inflation imposes significant hardship, especially on those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation. We are highly attentive to the risks high inflation poses to both sides of our mandate, and we are strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent objective. the process of significantly reducing the size of our balance sheet, which plays an important role in firming the stance of monetary policy. Over coming months, we will be looking for compelling evidence that inflation is moving down, consistent with inflation returning to 2 percent. We anticipate that ongoing increases in the target range for the federal funds rate will be appropriate; the pace of those increases will continue to depend on the incoming data and the evolving outlook for the economy. Today’s increase is the—in the target range is the second 75 basis point increase in as many meetings. While another unusually large increase could be appropriate at our next meeting, that is a decision that will depend on the data we get between now and then. We will continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting and communicating—and communicate our thinking as clearly as possible. As the stance of monetary policy tightens further, it likely will become appropriate to slow the pace of increases while we assess how our cumulative policy adjustments are affecting the economy and inflation. Our overarching focus is using our tools to bring demand into better balance with supply in order to bring inflation back down to our 2 percent goal and to keep longer-term inflation expectations well anchored. Making appropriate monetary policy in this uncertain environment requires a recognition that the economy often involves—evolves in unexpected ways. Inflation has obviously surprised to the upside over the past year, and further surprises could be in store. We therefore will need to be nimble in responding to incoming data and the evolving outlook. And we will strive to avoid adding uncertainty in what is already an extraordinarily challenging and uncertain time. We are highly attentive to inflation risks and determined to take the measures necessary to return likely necessary to restore price stability and to set the stage for achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the longer run. To conclude: We understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission. We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum-employment and price-stability goals. Thank you.","Opening Statement","Press Conf","","928","2022-07"
"2022-07-27","Sure. So we did judge that a 75 basis point increase was the right magnitude in light of the data and in the context of the ongoing increases in the policy rate that we’ve been making. I’d say that we wouldn’t hesitate to, to make an even larger move than we did today if the Committee were to conclude that that was—that that were appropriate. That was not the case at this meeting. There was very broad support for the move that we made. You mentioned the—the June meeting. We, we had said many times that we were prepared to move aggressively, more aggressively, if inflation continued to disappoint. And that’s why we did move to a more aggressive pace at the June meeting, as we said we would do.","Q&A","Press Conf","","130","2022-07"
"2022-07-27","So I guess I’d start by saying we’ve been saying we would move expeditiously to get to the range of neutral. And I think we’ve done that now. We’re at—we’re at 2.25 to 2.5 [percent], and that’s right in the range of what we think is neutral. So the question is, how are we thinking about the path forward? So one thing that hasn’t changed is that—won’t change—is that our focus is continuing to—is going to continue to be on using our tools to bring demand back into better balance with supply in order to bring inflation back down. That’ll continue to be our overarching focus. We also said that we expect ongoing rate hikes will be appropriate and that we’ll make decisions meeting by meeting. So what are we going to be looking at? You know, we’ll be looking at the incoming data, as I mentioned, and that’ll start with economic activity. Are we seeing the slowdown that we—the slowdown in economic activity—that we think we need? And there’s some evidence that we are at this time. Of course, we’ll be looking at labor market Of course, we’ll be looking closely at inflation. You mentioned headline and core. Our mandate is for headline, of course; it’s not for core. But we look at core because core is, is actually a better indicator of headline and of all inflation going forward. So we’ll be—we’ll be looking at both. And we’ll be looking at them for—at those both, really—for what they’re saying about the outlook rather than just simply for, for what they say. But we’ll be asking: Do we see inflationary pressures declining? Do we see actual readings of inflation coming down? So, in light of all that data, the question we’ll be asking is whether the stance of policy we have is sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation back down to our 2 percent target. And it’s also worth noting that these rate hikes have been large, and they’ve come—they’ve come quickly. And it’s likely that their full effect has not been felt by the economy. So there’s probably some additional tightening, significant additional tightening, in the pipeline. So where are we going with this? I think the best—I think the Committee broadly feels that we need to get policy to at least to a moderately restrictive level. And maybe the best data point for that would be what we wrote down in our SEP at the—at the June meeting. So I think the median [federal funds rate] for the end of this year, the median would’ve been between 3¼ and 3½ [percent]. And, then, people wrote down 50 basis points higher than that for 2023. So that’s—even though that’s now six weeks old, I guess, that’s—that’s the most recent reading. Of course, we’ll update that reading at the—at the September meeting in eight weeks. So that’s how we’re thinking about it. As I mentioned, as it relates to September, I said that another unusually large increase could be appropriate, but that’s not a decision we’re making now. It’s one that we’ll make based kind of clear guidance that we had provided on the way to neutral.","Q&A","Press Conf","","527","2022-07"
"2022-07-27","So I’m going to start by pointing out that it’s very hard to say with any confidence in normal times—in normal times—what the economy’s going to be doing in 6 or 12 months. And to try to predict what the appropriate monetary policy would respond— response would be—of course, we do that in the SEP, but, nonetheless, you’ve got to take any estimates of what rates will be next year with a grain of salt, because there’s so much uncertainty. These are not normal times. There’s significantly more uncertainty now about the path ahead than I think there ordinarily is, and, ordinarily, it’s quite high. So, again, I would—the best data, the only data point I have for you really is the June SEP, which I think is just the most recent thing that the Committee’s done. Since then, inflation has come in higher; economic activity has come in weaker than expected. end of this year—by which I mean somewhere between 3 and 3½ percent—and that when the Committee sees further rate increases in 2023, as I mentioned, we’ll update that, of course, at the September meeting. But that’s really the best I can do on that.","Q&A","Press Conf","","197","2022-07"
"2022-07-27","So I wouldn’t say it was—I think we didn’t expect a good reading, but this one—this one was even worse than expected, I would say. I don’t talk about my own personal estimate of, of what the terminal rate would be. I do—I will write down that in—it’s going to evolve. Obviously, it has evolved over the course—I think, for all participants, it has evolved over the course of the year as we learn how persistent inflation’s going to be. And by the time of the September meeting, we will have seen two more CPI readings and two more labor market readings and a significant amount of readings about economic activity and perhaps geopolitical developments, who knows. It’ll be—it’ll be a lot. It’s an eight-week intermeeting period, so I think we’ll see quite a lot of data. And we’ll make our decision at that meeting based on that data.","Q&A","Press Conf","","149","2022-07"
"2022-07-27","So we’re going to be—again, we’re going to be focused on getting inflation back down. And we—as I’ve said on other occasions, price stability is really the bedrock of the economy. And nothing works in the economy without price stability. We can’t have a strong labor market without price stability for an extended period of time. We all want to get back to the kind of labor market we had before the pandemic, where differences between, you know, racial and gender differences and that kind of thing were at historic minimums, where participation was high, where inflation was low. We want to get back to that, but that’s not happening. That’s not going to happen without, without restoring price stability. So that’s something we see as, as something that we simply must do. And we think that in the—we don’t see it as a tradeoff with, with the employment mandate. We see it as a way to facilitate the sustained achievement of the employment mandate in the longer term.","Q&A","Press Conf","","169","2022-07"
"2022-07-27","Nonetheless, job gains had been robust in recent months, and the unemployment rate had remained low.","Participants' Views","Minutes","N/A","16","2022-07"
"2022-07-27","So we’re trying to do just the right amount, right? We’re not—we’re not trying to have a recession. And we don’t think we have to. We think that there’s a path for us to be able to bring inflation down while sustaining a strong labor market, as I mentioned, along with—in all likelihood—some, some softening in labor market conditions. So that is— that’s what we’re trying to achieve, and we continue to think that there’s a path to that. We know that the path has, has clearly narrowed, really based on events that are outside of our control. And it may narrow further. So, you know, I do think—as I said just now—that restoring price stability is just something that we have to do. There, there isn’t an option to fail to do that because that is the thing that enables you to have a strong labor market over time. Without restoring price stability, you won’t be able, over the medium and longer term, to actually have a strong—a sustained period of very strong labor market conditions. So, of course, we serve both sides of the dual mandate, but we actually see them as well aligned on this.","Q&A","Press Conf","","198","2022-07"
"2022-07-27","However, the labor market continued to be very tight, and labor demand remained strong.","Staff Review of Economic Situation","Minutes","N/A","14","2022-07"
"2022-07-27","Inflation remained elevated, reflecting supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic, higher food and energy prices, and broader price pressures.","Participants' Views","Minutes","N/A","21","2022-07"
"2022-07-27","So I think we’re looking—we’re going to be looking at, at inflation as well. You know, as I mentioned, we need to see inflation coming down. We need to be And, but we do think, though, that the labor market can adjust because of the huge overhang of job openings, of excess demand, really. There should be able to be an adjustment that would have lower than—perhaps lower-than-expected increases in unemployment—lower than would be expected in the ordinary course of events because the level—the ratio of, of vacancies to unemployed is just out of keeping with historical experience. And that suggests that this time could be different.","Q&A","Press Conf","","107","2022-07"
"2022-07-27","Participants judged that the war and related events were creating additional upward pressure on inflation and were weighing on global economic activity.","Participants' Views","Minutes","N/A","22","2022-07"
"2022-07-27","We’re trying not to make a mistake. Let me put it this way: We do see that there are two-sided risks. There would be the risk of doing too much and, you know, imposing more of a downturn on the economy than, than was necessary, but the risk—the risk of doing too little and leaving the economy with this entrenched inflation, it only raises the cost. If They start to factor high inflation into their decisions—when that—on a sustained basis. When that starts to really happen, and we don’t think that’s happened yet, but when that starts to happen, it just gets that much harder. And the pain will be that much greater. So I really do think that it’s important that we—that we address this now and get it done.","Q&A","Press Conf","","131","2022-07"
"2022-07-27","I mean, there are precedents for the FOMC moving very quickly— for example, in 1994, and in 1980, even more so. So we’ve been known to do that when it’s the appropriate thing to do. And this year, it clearly is. I would say that, given how quickly we’ve moved, I’m gratified that while—that, basically, markets have been working. They’ve been orderly. There’s been some volatility, but that’s only to be expected. they’re—that they’re vulnerable to a fall, actually. Many asset values have come down. I think you’ve got a well-capitalized banking system. I think you have—households are generally in about as strong as financial shape as they’ve been in a very long time or perhaps ever given the money that’s on people’s balance sheets. So you have a pretty—from a financial stability standpoint, you have a pretty decent picture. Now, the macroeconomic, there are plenty of macroeconomic issues that don’t rise to the level of financial stability concerns. By financial stability, you know, we think of that as things that might undermine the working of the financial system, so big, serious things. That’s not to say that people at the lower end of the income spectrum aren’t, aren’t suffering, because they are. They’re suffering from high inflation. They’re going to the—to the grocery store and finding that, in many cases, their paycheck doesn’t cover the food they’re accustomed to buying. We’re seeing actual, you know, real declines in food consumption. And, you know, it’s very concerning. It’s very unfortunate. And that’s why we’re—we’re really committed to bringing down inflation—one of the reasons.","Q&A","Press Conf","","263","2022-07"
"2022-07-27","No, all I’ve really said is I don’t think it’s likely that the","Q&A","Press Conf","","13","2022-07"
"2022-07-27","So I think, broadly, a lot of economists think that the—that the natural rate of unemployment will have moved up to some significant extent above where we think it was before. And the reason is there’s—it’s the usual matching issue, where matching has become less effective, and that kind of thing when you have the kind of turbulent downturn and don’t know it. We can never know where these star variables are in real time with any confidence. But I would say it must have moved up materially. But the other side of that is, as all these jobs get created and people go back to work and unemployment is so low, I think you could, in principle, you could see it coming back down pretty significantly. And that would also, by the way, take pressure off of inflation because it’s that gap—it’s the gap between actual unemployment and the—and the natural rate that really is relevant for, you know, the negative slack we have in the economy with the overtight labor market. So if you were to—you wouldn’t observe this. It’s an unobservable, but you could actually be seeing inflationary pressures coming down if that does happen. And we don’t—we don’t control that. But that’s something that, logically, if the pandemic and the disorder in the labor market caused the natural rate to move up, then as the labor market settles down, in principle, you should see it move back down.","Q&A","Press Conf","","242","2022-07"
"2022-07-27","So I think we learned—there’ve been multiple taper tantrums, right? So there was the famous one in 2013. There’s what happened at the December ’18 meeting, where, you know, markets can ignore developments around the balance sheet for years on end and then suddenly react very sharply. So we just had developed a practice of moving predictably and doing it in steps and things like that. It was just like that’s how we did it. And so we did it that way this time. We were—we were careful to, to take steps and communicate and all that kind of thing. Yes, we were trying to avoid a tantrum because they can be quite destructive. They can tighten financial conditions and knock the economy off kilter. And, you know, when it happens, you have to—really, in both ’13 and ’18, it really had consequences for the real Again, I don’t think that’s—the real issue of 2020 and ’21 was just trying to understand what was happening with the reopening economy. That, that was where the big uncertainty was. And, you know, our view was that these supply-side issues would get better: that people would go back to work, that labor force participation would come back, everyone would get vaccinated, schools would open, kids would be in school, and labor force participation would jump back up. That’s what we were—that was very broadly thought to be the case: these supply-side issues would get solved reasonably quickly. And they just haven’t. They still haven’t. So that’s really the learning, I think, is around how complicated these supply-side issues can be. We haven’t seen this before in a long, long time. And so that’s really, you know, what accounts for the pace at which we moved, and we did. When inflation changed direction, really, in October, we’ve moved quickly since then. I think people would agree. But before then, inflation was coming down month by month. And, you know, we kind of thought we had the story—probably had the story right. But then, I think in October, you started to see a range of data that said “No. This is a much stronger economy and much higher inflation than we’ve been thinking.” And, again, we’ve pivoted, and here we are.","Q&A","Press Conf","","376","2022-07"
"2022-07-27","So, yes, we said that we wouldn’t lift off until we had basically achieved our dual-mandate goals. And the reason we did it in real time was that, the first look at the new framework that we’d rolled out, plenty of people were saying, “It’s not credible. You’ll never get inflation to 2 percent.” Some of our critics now who say inflation’s too tight—too high were the same ones who were saying, “You’ll never get to 2 percent.” Well, but anyway, that’s what happened. So we, we thought we needed to really make a strong statement with that. It wasn’t part of the framework. The December ’20 guidance was not part of our overall new framework. It was just guidance that we put in place. So I would say two things. One, I don’t think that that has materially changed the situation. But I have to admit, I don’t think I would do that again. I don’t think I would do that again. We—you know, ultimately, the situation evolved in a highly But did it matter in the end? You know, we—if you look at—I really don’t think it did. I’m not sure it would’ve mattered if we’d been raising rates three months earlier. Does anybody think that would’ve made a big difference? I mean, lots of central banks were raising rates three months earlier, and it didn’t matter. I mean, this is a—this is a global phenomenon that’s happening now—admittedly, different in the United States, but anyway.","Q&A","Press Conf","","248","2022-07"
"2022-07-27","So a big piece of that is inflation expectations—you know, breakevens coming down, which, you know, is a good thing. It’s a good thing that markets do seem to have confidence in, in the Committee’s commitment to getting inflation back down to 2 percent. So we like to see market-based, you know, readings of inflation expectations come down. You know, broader financial conditions have tightened, tightened a good bit. I mean, the way this works is we, we set our policy, and financial conditions react, and then financial conditions are what affects the economy. And we don’t control that second step. We’re just going to do what we think needs to be done. We’re going to—we’re going to get our policy rate to a level where we’re confident that and that they’re having the effect that we would hope they’re having, which is to see demand moderate and inflationary pressures recede and, ultimately, inflation come down.","Q&A","Press Conf","","156","2022-07"

"2022-07-27","So I think you’re already seeing—you’ve seen, in the labor market, what you’ve seen is a decline from very high levels of job creation last year and earlier this year to modestly slower job creation—still, still quite robust, as I mentioned. So you’re seeing that. You’re seeing some increase—some increase in initial claims from insurance, although that may actually have to do with seasonal adjustments. We’re not sure that that’s actually real. employment compensation index measurement, I think, on Friday, I guess. And that’s a very important one because it adjusts for compensation—composition. So I’d say you—and also, anecdotally, you hear much—the sort of level of concern on the part of businesses that they simply can’t find workers is probably down a little bit from what it was, say, for example, late in the latter parts of last year. So there’s a feeling that the labor market is moving back into balance. If you look at—if you look at job openings or quits, you see them moving sideways or perhaps a little bit down. But it’s only the beginning of an adjustment. But I think most—also, if you look at—I mean, once you start citing these things, you can’t stop. If you look at the household survey, you see much lower job creation, and the household survey can be quite volatile, but it has no jobs created in the last three months. So that might be a signal that job creation’s actually a little bit slower than we’re seeing in the—in the establishment survey. So executive summary [is]: I would say there’s some evidence that labor demand may be slowing a bit—labor supply, not so much. We have been disappointed that labor force participation really hasn’t moved up since January. That may be related to yet another big wave of","Q&A","Press Conf","","300","2022-07"
"2022-07-27","So we think it’s working fine. As you know, we, we tapered up into it. And, and in September, we’ll go to full strength. And the markets seem to have accepted it. By all assessments, the markets should be able to absorb this. And we expect that’ll be the case. So I guess your second question was getting—the process of getting back down to the new equilibrium will take a while. And that time, it’s hard to be precise, but, you know, the model would suggest that it could be between two, two and a half years, that kind of thing. And this is a much faster pace than the last time. Balance sheet’s much, much bigger than it was. But we looked at this carefully, and we thought that this, this was the sensible pace. And we have no reason to think it’s not.","Q&A","Press Conf","","145","2022-07"

"2022-07-27","So I’m going to—I’m going to take that as a question about the next meeting and thereafter. So, as I mentioned, we’re going to be looking at all of those things: activity, labor market, inflation. And we’re going to be thinking about our policy stance and where does it really need to be. And I also mentioned that, as this process—now that we’re at neutral—as the process goes on, at some point, it will be appropriate to, to slow down. And we haven’t made a decision when that point is, but intuitively that makes sense, right? We’ve been front-end-loading these very large rate increases, and now we’re getting closer to where we need to be. So that’s how we’re thinking about it. And in terms of September, we’re going—we’re going to watch the data and the evolving outlook very carefully and factor in everything and make a decision in September about what to do. And I’m not really going to provide any specific guidance about what that might be. So, you know, but I mentioned that we might do another unusually large rate increase. But that’s not a decision that we’ve made at all. So we are—you know, we’re going to be guided by the data. And I think you can still think of the, the destination as broadly in line with the September—sorry, the June SEP, because Committee thinks it needs to get at the end of the year and then into next year.

"2022-07-27","Well, just talking about demand for a second: As I mentioned in my remarks, I think you pretty clearly do see a slowing now in demand in the second quarter— consumer spending, business fixed investment, housing, places like that. I think, you know, people widely looked at the first-quarter numbers and thought they didn’t make sense and might have been misleading in terms of the overall direction of the economy—[that was] not, not true of the second quarter. But at the same time, you have this labor market. So there are plenty of experiences where GDP has been reported as weak and the labor market as strong. And the economy has gone right through that and been fine. So that—that’s happened many times. And it used to happen—if you remember, in the first quarter of every year, for several years in a row, GDP was negative, and the labor market was moving on just The truth is, though, we, we think that demand is moderating. We do. How much is it moderating? We’re not sure. We’re going to have to watch the data carefully. There are—there is a great deal of money on people’s balance sheets that they can spend. The unemployment rate is very low. The labor market’s very hot. There are many, many job openings. Wages are high. So it’s the kind of thing where you think that the—that the economy should actually be, be doing pretty well in the second half of the year. But we’ll have to see. We don’t know that because you do see a marked slowing in the second quarter that does—that is fairly broad. So we’ll be watching that. We’ll be watching that. Of course, as I mentioned, we do want to see demand running below potential for a sustained period to create slack and, and give inflation a chance to come down.","Q&A","Press Conf","","311","2022-07"

"2022-08-26","But that is not grounds for complacency, with inflation having run well above our goal for some time.","General","Speech","N/A","18","2022-08"
"2022-08-26","The successful Volcker disinflation in the early 1980s followed multiple failed attempts to lower inflation over the previous 15 years.","General","Speech","N/A","20","2022-08"
"2022-09-21","Yeah. So we, as we said at the last press conference and in between that one and this one, we said that we would make our decision based on the overall data coming in. So, if you remember, we got a surprisingly low reading in July and then a surprisingly high reading for August. So I think you have to—you can’t really—you never want to overreact too much to any one data point. So if you look at them together—and, as I just mentioned, if you really look at this year’s inflation, 3-, 6-, and 12-month trailing, you see inflation is running too high. It’s running 4.5 percent or above; you don’t need to know much more than that. If that’s the one thing you know, you know that this Committee is committed to getting to a meaningfully restrictive stance of policy and staying there until we feel confident that inflation is coming down. That’s how we think about it.","Q&A","Press Conf","","160","2022-09"
"2022-09-21","I think that shelter inflation is going to remain high for some time. We’re looking for it to come down, but it’s not exactly clear when that will happen. So it may","Q&A","Press Conf","","32","2022-09"
"2022-09-21","So when I say “reset,” I’m not looking at a particular, specific set of data or anything. What I’m really saying is that we’ve had a time of a red-hot housing market all over the country, where, famously, houses were selling to the first buyer at 10 percent above the ask, before even seeing the house. That kind of thing. So there was a big imbalance between supply and demand. Housing prices were going up at an unsustainably fast level. So the deceleration in housing prices that we’re seeing should help bring sort of prices more closely in line with rents and other housing market fundamentals, and that’s a good thing. For the longer term, what we need is supply and demand to get better aligned so that housing prices go up at a reasonable level—at a reasonable pace—and that people can afford houses again. And I think we—so we probably, in the housing market, have to go through a correction to get back to that place. There’s also, there are also longer-run issues, though, with the housing market. As you know, we’re—it’s difficult to find lots now close enough to cities and things like that, so builders are having a hard time getting zoning and lots and workers and materials and things like that. But from a sort of business cycle standpoint, this difficult correction should put the housing market back into better balance.","Q&A","Press Conf","","235","2022-09"
"2022-09-21","So it’s all of those things. Higher interest rates, slower growth, and a softening labor market are all painful for the public that we serve. But they’re not as painful as failing to restore price stability and then having to come back and do it down the road again and doing it at a time when, actually, now people have really come to expect high inflation. If the concept of high inflation becomes entrenched in people’s economic thinking about their decisions, then sort of getting back to price stability—the cost of getting back to price stability just rises, and so we want to avoid that. We want to act aggressively now and get this job done and keep at it until it’s done.","Q&A","Press Conf","","123","2022-09"
"2022-09-21","How long? I mean, it really depends on how long it takes for wages and, more than that, prices to come down for inflation to come down. And so what you see in our projections today is that inflation moves down significantly over the course of next year and then more the next year after that. And I think once you’re on that path, that’s a good thing. And things will start to feel better to people—they’ll feel lower inflation, they’ll feel that the economy is improving. And also, if our projections are close to right, you’ll see that the costs in unemployment are, they’re meaningful, and they’re certainly very meaningful to the people who lose their jobs. And we talk about that in our meetings quite a lot. But, at the same time, we’d be setting the economy up for another long period—this era has been noted for very long expansions. We’ve had three of the four longest in measured what we saw in 2018, ’19, and ’20, which was very low unemployment, the biggest wage gains going to people at the low end of the spectrum, the smallest racial gaps that we’ve seen since we started keeping track of that. So we want to get back to that. But, to get there, we’re going to have to get supply and demand back in alignment, and that’s going to take tight monetary policy for a period of time.","Q&A","Press Conf","","239","2022-09"
"2022-09-21","So, for starters, people are seeing their wage increases eaten up by inflation. So if your family is one where you spend most of your paycheck, every paycheck cycle, on gas, food, transportation, clothing, basics of life, and prices go up the way they’ve been going up, you’re in trouble right away. You don’t have a cushion, and this is very painful for people at the lower end of the income and wealth spectrum. So that’s what we’re hearing from people is, you know, very much—that inflation is really hurting. So how do we get rid of inflation? And, as I mentioned, it would be nice if there were a way to just wish it away, but there isn’t. We have to get supply and demand back into alignment, and the way we do that is by slowing the economy. Hopefully, we do that by slowing the economy, and we see some softening in labor market conditions, and we see a big contribution from supply-side improvements, and things like that. But none of that is guaranteed. really saw that for a long time. The United States had 2 percent inflation, didn’t move around much, and that was enormously beneficial to the public that we serve. And we have to get back to that and keep it for another long period of time. To pull back from the task of doing that is, you’re just postponing—the record shows that if you postpone that, the delay is only likely to lead to more pain. So I think we’re moving to do what we need to do and do our jobs, and that’s what you see us doing.","Q&A","Press Conf","","275","2022-09"
"2022-09-21","So I don’t know what the odds are. I think that there’s a very high likelihood that we’ll have a period of what I’ve mentioned is below-trend growth, by which I mean much lower growth, and we’re seeing that now. So the median forecast, I think, this year among my colleagues and me was 0.2 percent growth. So that’s very slow growth. And then below trend next year. I think the median was 1.2, also well below. So that’s a slower, that’s a very slow level of growth, and it could give rise to increases in unemployment. But I think that’s, so that is something that we think we need to have, and we think we need to have softer labor market conditions as well. We’re never going to say that there are too many people working, but the real point is this: Inflation—what we hear from people when we meet with them is that they really are suffering from inflation. And if we want to set ourselves up, really light the way to another period of a very strong labor market, we have got to get inflation behind us. I wish there were a painless way to do that. There isn’t. So, what we need to do is get rates up to the point where we’re putting meaningful downward pressure on inflation, and that’s what we’re doing. And we certainly don’t hope, we certainly haven’t given up the idea that we can have a relatively modest increase in unemployment. Nonetheless, we need to complete this task.","Q&A","Press Conf","","257","2022-09"
"2022-09-21","You’re right, of course—the labor market, in particular, has been very strong. But there are—the sectors of the economy that are most interest rate sensitive are certainly showing the effects of our tightening, and, of course, the obvious example is housing, having an effect on exports and imports. I think—so all of that’s happening, but you’re right, and we’ve said this: This is a strong, robust economy. People have savings on their balance sheet from the period when they couldn’t spend and where they were getting government transfers. There’s still very significant savings out there, although not as much at the lower end of the income spectrum—but still, some savings out there to support growth. The states are very flush with cash, so there’s good reason to think that this will continue to be a reasonably strong economy. Now, the data sort of are showing that growth is going to be below trend this year. We think of trend as being about 1.8 percent, or in that range. We’re forecasting growth well below that, and most forecasters are. But you’re right—there’s certainly a possibility that growth can be stronger than that. And that’s a good thing, because that means the economy will be more resistant to a significant downturn. But, of course, we are focused on the thing I started with, which is getting inflation back down to 2 percent. We can’t fail to do that. I mean, if we were to fail to do that, that would be the thing that would be most painful for the people that we serve. So for now, that has to be our overarching focus, and you see that, I think, in the SEP, in the levels of rates that we’ll be moving to reasonably quickly, assuming things turn out roughly in line with the","Q&A","Press Conf","","302","2022-09"
"2022-09-21","So we, actually, my colleagues and I, a number of my FOMC colleagues and I, just got back from one of our frequent trips to Basel, Switzerland, to meet with other senior central bank officials from around the world. We are in pretty regular contact, and we exchange, of course—we all serve a domestic mandate, domestic objectives—in our case, the dual mandate, maximum employment and price stability. But we regularly discuss what we’re seeing in terms of our own economy and international spillovers, and it’s a very ongoing, constant kind of a process. So we are very aware of what’s going on in other economies around the world and what that means for us, and vice versa. The forecasts that we put together, that our staff puts together, and that we put together on our own always take all of that—try to take all of that into account. I major economies that can have an effect on the","Q&A","Press Conf","","158","2022-09"
"2022-09-21","I think a number of things might affect that decision, really. The main thing is, we’re not considering that decision, and I don’t expect that we will any time soon.","Q&A","Press Conf","","30","2022-09"
"2022-09-21","So I think if you look, when we get to—if we—let’s assume we do get to that level, which I think is likely. What you’re going to do is, you’re going to adjust that for some forward-looking measure of inflation. And that could be—you pick your measure. It could be—there are all kinds of different things you could pick and you get—but what you’ll get is a positive number. In all cases, you will get forward inflation expectations in the short term, I think, that are going to be, assuming that we’re doing our jobs appropriately, that will be significant. So you’ll have a positive [real] federal funds rate at that point, which could be 1 percent or so, but—I mean, I don’t know exactly what it would be. But it would be significantly positive when we get to that level. And let me say, we’ve written down what we think is a plausible path for the federal funds rate. The path that we actually execute will be enough. It will be enough to restore price stability. So this is something that, as you can see, they’ve moved up, and we’re going to continue to watch incoming data and the evolving outlook and ask ourselves whether our policy is in the right place as we go. Thank you very much.","Q&A","Press Conf","","220","2022-09"
"2022-09-21","So I guess core is at 2.1 in 2025—in the median—and headline is at 2.0, so that’s pretty close. I mean, we write down our forecasts, and we figure out what the than 2 percent.","Q&A","Press Conf","","35","2022-09"
"2022-09-21","So we make one decision per meeting, and the decision we made today was to raise the federal funds rate by 75 [basis points]. You’re right that the median for the year-end suggests another 125 basis points in rate increases, but there’s also, there’s another fairly large group that saw a 100 basis points addition to where we are today. So that would be 25 basis points less. So we’re going to make that decision at the meeting. We didn’t make that decision today; we didn’t vote on that. I would say that we’re committed to getting to a restrictive level for the federal funds rate and getting there pretty quickly, and that’s what we’re thinking about. What’s the incentive to continue front-loading right now? Is it lack of progress on inflation seen in the CPI reports? Or is it a motivation to get as much done while the job market is still as strong as it is?","Q&A","Press Conf","","158","2022-09"
"2022-09-21","Well, so, again, we believe that we need to raise our policy stance overall to a level that is restrictive—and by that I mean, is meaningfully, putting meaningful downward pressure on inflation. That’s what we need to see in the stance of policy. We also you know; you look at where rates are, real and nominal in some cases; you look at credit spreads; you look at financial conditions indexes. We also, I would think—and you see this in the—this is something we talked about today in the meeting and talk about in all of our meetings. And you see this, I think, in the Committee forecast. You want to be at a place where real rates are positive across the entire yield curve. And I think that would be the case if you look at the numbers that we’re writing down and think about—you measure those against some sort of forward-looking assessment of inflation, inflation expectations. I think you would see at that time—you’d see positive real rates across the yield curve, and that is also an important consideration.","Q&A","Press Conf","","180","2022-09"
"2022-09-21","Yes, vacancies are still almost a 2-to-1 ratio to unemployed people. That and quits are really very good ways to look at how tight the labor market is and how different it is from other cycles, where, generally, the unemployment rate itself is the single best indicator. We think those things have, for quite a time now, really added value in terms of understanding where the labor market is.","Q&A","Press Conf","","69","2022-09"
"2022-09-21","Right. So you’re right—in the SEP, there’s what I would characterize as a relatively modest increase in the unemployment rate from a historical perspective, given the expected decline in inflation. Now, why is that? So, really, that is what we generally expect because we see the current situation as outside of historical experience in a number of ways, and I’ll mention a couple of those. First—and you know these—but first, job of an increase in unemployment as has happened in earlier historical episodes. So that’s one thing. In addition, in this cycle, longer-run inflation expectations have generally been fairly well anchored, and, as I’ve said, there’s no basis for complacency there. But to the extent that continues to be the case, that should make it easier to restore price stability. And I guess the third thing I would point to that’s different this time is that part of this inflation is caused by this series of supply shocks that we’ve had, beginning with the pandemic, and, really, with the reopening of the economy, and more recently amplified and added to by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine—have all contributed to the sharp increase in inflation. So these are the kinds of events that are not really seen in prior business cycles, and, in principle, if those things start to get better—and we do see some evidence of the beginnings of that. It’s not much more than that, but it’s good to see that. For example, commodity prices look like they may have peaked for now; supply chain disruptions are beginning to resolve. Those developments, if sustained, could help ease the pressures on inflation. So let me just say, how much these factors will turn out to really matter in this sequence of events—it remains to be seen. We have always understood that restoring price stability while achieving a relatively modest decline—or, rather, increase—in unemployment and a soft landing would be very challenging. And we don’t know—no one knows whether this process will lead to a recession or, if so, how significant that recession would be. That’s going to depend on how quickly wage and price inflation pressures come down, whether expectations remain anchored, and whether, also, do we get more labor supply, which would help as well. inflation back down to 2 percent—because we think that a failure to restore price stability would mean far greater pain later on.","Q&A","Press Conf","","397","2022-09"
"2022-09-21","Good afternoon. My colleagues and I are strongly committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal. We have both the tools we need and the resolve that it will take to restore price stability on behalf of American families and businesses. Price stability is the responsibility of the Federal Reserve and serves as the bedrock of our economy. Without price stability, the economy does not work for anyone. In particular, without price stability, we will not achieve a sustained period of strong labor market conditions that benefit all. Today the FOMC raised its policy interest rate by ¾ percentage point, and we anticipate that ongoing increases will be appropriate. We are moving our policy stance purposefully to a level that will be sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2 percent. In addition, we are continuing the process of significantly reducing the size of our balance sheet. I will have more to say about today’s monetary policy actions after briefly reviewing economic developments. The","Opening Statement","Press Conf","","166","2022-09"
"2022-09-21","So I will answer—I will answer your question directly, but I want to start here today by saying that my main message has not changed at all since Jackson Hole. The FOMC is strongly resolved to bring inflation down to 2 percent, and we will keep at it until the job is done. So the way we’re thinking about this is, the overarching focus of the Committee is getting inflation back down to 2 percent. To accomplish that, we think we’ll need to do two things, in particular: to achieve a period of growth below trend; and also some softening in labor market conditions to foster a better balance between demand and supply in the labor market. So on the first, the Committee’s forecasts and those of most outside forecasters do show growth running below its longer-run potential this year and next year. On the second, though, so far there’s only modest evidence that the labor market is cooling off. Job openings are down a bit, as you know; quits are off their all-time highs; there’s some signs that some wage measures may be flattening out but not moving up; payroll gains have moderated but not much. And in light of the high inflation we’re seeing, we think we’ll need to—and in light of what I just said, we think that we’ll need to bring our funds rate to a restrictive level and to keep it there for some time. So, what will we be looking at, I guess, is your question. So we’ll be looking at a few things. First, we’ll want to see growth continuing to run below trend, we’ll want to see movements in the labor market showing a return to a better balance between supply and demand, and, ultimately, we’ll want to see clear evidence that inflation is moving back down to 2 percent. So that’s what we’ll be looking for. In terms of reducing rates, I think we’d want to be very confident that inflation is moving back down to 2 percent before we would consider that. about how you factor in the variable lags on inflation and the extent to which the outlook for rates should be seen as linear in the sense that you keep raising rates? Well, can you envision a time when there’s a pause to kind of look at what has been wrought in the economy from the rate increases? Thank you.","Q&A","Press Conf","","402","2022-09"
"2022-09-21","Sure. So, of course, monetary policy does, famously, work with long and variable lags. The way I think of it is, our policy decisions affect financial conditions immediately. In fact, financial conditions have usually been affected well before we actually announce our decisions. Then, changes in financial conditions begin to affect economic activity fairly quickly, within a few months. But it’s likely to take some time to see the full effects of changing financial conditions on inflation. So we are very much mindful for that. And that’s why I noted in my opening remarks that, at some point, as the stance of policy tightens further, it will become appropriate to slow the pace of rate hikes while we assess how our cumulative policy adjustments are affecting the economy and inflation. So that’s how we think about that. Your second question—sorry—was?","Q&A","Press Conf","","140","2022-09"
"2022-09-21","I should know better than to answer your second question. [Laughter]","Q&A","Press Conf","","11","2022-09"
"2022-09-21","So I think it’s very hard to say with precise certainty the way this is going to unfold. As I mentioned, what we think we need to do and should do is to move our policy rate to a restrictive level that’s restrictive enough to bring inflation down to 2 percent, where we have confidence of that. And what you see in the SEP numbers is people’s views as of today, as of this meeting, as to the kind of levels that will be appropriate. Now, those will evolve over time, and I think we’ll just have to see how that goes. There is a possibility, certainly, that we would go to a certain level that we’re confident in and stay there for a time. But we’re not at that level. Clearly, today we’re, we’ve just moved, I think, probably, into the very lowest level of what might be restrictive, and, certainly, in my view and the view of the Committee, there’s a ways to go.","Q&A","Press Conf","","166","2022-09"
"2022-09-21","So, what we’ve seen is, inflation has—our expectation has been that we would begin to see inflation come down, largely because of supply-side healing. By now we would have thought that we’d have seen some of that. We haven’t. We have seen some supply- side healing, but inflation has not really come down. If you look at core PCE inflation, which is a good measure of where inflation is running now, if you look at it on a 3-, 6-, and 12-month trailing annualized basis, you’ll see that inflation is at 4.8 percent, 4.5 percent, and 4.8 percent. So that’s a pretty good summary of where we are with inflation. And that’s not where we expected or wanted to be. So, what that tells us is that we need to continue, and we can—keep doing these, and we did today—do another large increase as we approach the level that we think we need to get to. And we’re still discovering what that level is. But people are writing that down in their SEP where they think policy needs to be. So that’s how we’re thinking about it.","Q&A","Press Conf","","187","2022-09"

"2022-11-02","So a couple things on that. We do need to see inflation coming down decisively, and good evidence of that would be a series of down monthly readings. Of course, that’s what we’d all love to see, but that’s—I’ve never thought of that as the appropriate test for slowing the pace of increases or for identifying the appropriately restrictive level that we’re aiming for. We need to bring our policy stance down to a level that’s sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation down to our 2 percent objective over the medium term. How will we know that we’ve reached that level? Well, we’ll take into account the full range of analysis and data that bear on that question, guided by our assessment of how much financial conditions have tightened, the effects that that tightening is actually having on the real economy and on inflation,","Q&A","Press Conf","","143","2022-11"
"2022-11-02","So, what I want to do is put that question of pace in the context of our broader tightening program, if I may, and talk about the statement language along the way. So I think you can think about our tightening program as really addressing three questions, the first of which was, and has been, how fast to go. The second is how high to raise our policy rate. And the third will be, eventually, how long to remain at a restrictive level. So on the first question—how fast to tighten policy—it’s been very important that we move expeditiously, and we have clearly done so. We’ve moved 3¾ percent since March, admittedly from a base of zero. It’s a historically fast pace, and that’s certainly appropriate given the persistence and strength in inflation and the low level from which we started. So now we come to the second question, which is how high to raise our policy rate. And we’re saying that we’d raise that rate to a level that’s sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation to our 2 percent target over time, and we put that into our postmeeting statement because that really does become the important question, we think now, is how far to go. And I’ll talk more about that. We think there’s some ground to cover before we meet that test, and that’s why we say that ongoing rate increases will be appropriate. And, as I mentioned, incoming data between the meetings, both a strong labor market report but particularly the CPI report, do suggest to me that Of course, with the lags between policy and economic activity, there’s a lot of uncertainty, so we note that in determining the pace of future increases, we’ll take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy as well as the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation. So I would say, as we come closer to that level, move more into restrictive territory, the question of speed becomes less important than the second and third questions. And that’s why I’ve said at the last two press conferences that at some point, it will become appropriate to slow the pace of increases. So that time is coming, and it may come as soon as the next meeting or the one after that. No decision has been made. It is likely we’ll have a discussion about this at the next meeting, a discussion. To be clear, let me say again [that] the question of when to moderate the pace of increases is now much less important than the question of how high to raise rates and how long to keep monetary policy restricted, which really will be our principal focus.","Q&A","Press Conf","","452","2022-11"

"2022-11-02","So this is the question of, does the policy rate need to get above the inflation rate? And I would say, there are a range of views on it. That’s the classic “Taylor principle” view. But I would think you’d look more at a forward, a forward-looking measure of inflation to look at that. But I think the answer is, we’ll want to get the policy rate to a level where it is, where the real interest rate is positive. We will want to do that. I do not think of it as the single and only touchstone, though. I think you put some weight on that; you also put some weight on rates across the curve. Very few people borrow at the short end—at the federal funds rate, for example. So households and businesses, if they’re [borrowing]—[there are] very meaningfully positive interest rates all across the curve for them, credit spreads are larger, so borrowing rates are significantly higher, and I think financial conditions have tightened quite a bit. So I would look at that as an important feature. I’d put some weight on it, but I wouldn’t say it’s something that is the single, dominant thing to look at.","Q&A","Press Conf","","201","2022-11"
"2022-11-02","Members agreed that inflation had remained elevated, reflecting supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic, higher food and energy prices, and broader price pressures.","Participants' Views","Minutes","N/A","25","2022-11"
"2022-11-02","I don’t have a specific number for you there. There are many, many models that look at that. And, I mean, one way to look at it is that it’s a pretty stationary object and that when inflation runs—above that level, for sure—substantially above for some time, you’ll see it move up, but the movement will be fairly gradual. So I think that’s what the principal models would tend to say. But I wouldn’t want to land on any one assessment. There are many different—as you know, many different people publish an assessment of underlying inflation.","Q&A","Press Conf","","96","2022-11"
"2022-11-02","Well, so we do monitor the near-term forward spread—you’re right. And it’s—that’s been our preferred measure. We think, just empirically, it dominates the ones that people tend to look at, which is 2s, 10s, and things like that. So it’s not inverted. And, also, you have to look at why things—why the rate curve is doing what it’s doing. It can be doing that because it affects—it expects cuts or because it expects inflation to come down. In this case, if you’re in a situation where the markets are pricing in significant declines in inflation, that’s","Q&A","Press Conf","","96","2022-11"
"2022-11-02","I think as we move now into restrictive territory, as we make these ongoing rate hikes and policy becomes more restrictive, it’ll be appropriate now to be thinking more about lags. Of course, we think about lags—the lags are just sort of a basic part of monetary policy. But we will be thinking about them, but we won’t be—I think we’ll be considering them but because it’s appropriate to do so. Let me say this: It is very premature to be thinking about pausing. So people, when they hear lags, they think about a pause. It’s very premature, in my view, to think about or be talking about pausing our rate hike. We have a ways to go. Our policy—we need ongoing rate hikes to get to that level of sufficiently restrictive. And we don’t—of course, we don’t really know exactly where that is. We have a sense, and we’re seeing with incoming data.","Q&A","Press Conf","","154","2022-11"
"2022-11-02","Well, what’s happened is, time has passed, and we’ve raised interest rates by 375 basis points. I would not—I would not change a word in that statement, though. I think until we get inflation down, you’ll be hearing that from me. Again, if we overtighten—and we don’t want to, we want to get this exactly right—but if we overtighten, then we have the ability with our tools, which are powerful, to, as we showed at the beginning of the pandemic episode, we can support economic activity strongly if that happens, if that’s necessary. On the other hand, if you make the mistake in the other direction and you let this drag on, then it’s a year or two down the road, and you’re realizing, inflation behaving the way it can, you’re realizing you didn’t actually get it, you have to go back in. By then, the risk, really, is that it has become entrenched in people’s thinking. And the record is that the employment costs—the cost to the people that we don’t want to hurt—they go up with the passage of time. That’s really how I look at it. So that isn’t going to change. What has changed, though—you’re right—is, we’re farther along now. And I think as we’re farther along, we’re now focused on that. What’s the place, what’s the level we need to get to rates? And I don’t know what we’ll do when we get there, by the way. It doesn’t—we’ll have to see. There’s been no decision or discussion around exactly what steps we would take at that point. But the first thing is to find your way there.","Q&A","Press Conf","","273","2022-11"
"2022-11-02","So this is an interesting subject. So I start by saying, I guess, that the measure that’s in the CPI and the PCE, it captures rents for all tenants, not just new leases. And that makes sense, actually, because for that reason—conceptually, that is—that’s sort of the right target for monetary policy. And the same thing is true for owners’ equivalent rent, which comes off of—it’s a reweighting of tenant rents. The private measures are, of course, good at picking up, at the margin, the new leases, and they tell you a couple things. One thing is, I think right now, if you look at the pattern of that series of the new leases, it’s very pro-cyclical, so rents went up much more than the CPI and PCE rents did. And now they’re coming down faster. But what you’re—the implication is that there are still, as people, as non-new leases roll over and expire, right, they’re still in the pipeline, there’s still some significant rate increases coming, okay? But at some point, once you get through that, the new leases are going to tell you—what they’re telling you is, there will come a point at which rent inflation will start to come down. But that point is well out from where we are now. So we’re well aware of that, of course, and we look at it. But I would say that in terms of—the right way to think about inflation, really, is to look at the measure that we do look at, but considering that we also know that at some point, you’ll see rents coming down. to see? Is that a problem or what—how that might affect your future policy to see this positive reaction?","Q&A","Press Conf","","287","2022-11"
"2022-11-02","We’re not targeting any one or two particular things. Our message should be—what I’m trying to do is make sure that our message is clear, which is that we think we have a ways to go, we have some ground to cover with interest rates before we get to, before we get to that level of interest rates that we think is sufficiently restrictive. And putting that in the statement and identifying that as a goal is an important step. And that’s meant to put that question, really, as the important one now, going forward. I’ve also said that we think that the level of rates that we estimated in September—the incoming data suggests that that’s actually going to be higher, and that’s been the pattern. I mean, I would have little confidence that the forecast—if we made a forecast today, if we were doing an SEP today, the pattern has been that, one after another, they go up, and that’ll end when it ends, but there’s no sense that inflation is coming down. If you look at the—I have a table of the last 12 months of 12-month readings, and there’s really no pattern there. We’re exactly where we were a year ago. So I would also say, it’s premature to discuss pausing. And it’s not something that we’re thinking about. That’s really not a conversation to be had now. We have a ways to go. And the last thing I’ll say is that I would want people to understand our commitment to getting this done and to not making the mistake of not doing enough or the mistake of withdrawing our strong policy and doing that too soon. So those—I control those messages, and that’s my job. Chairman. So how big of a headwind is all the fiscal spending to what the Federal Reserve’s trying to do to get inflation back to the 2 percent target?","Q&A","Press Conf","","318","2022-11"
"2022-11-02","In theory, it was a headwind this year, but I do think the broader context is that you have households that have these significant amounts of savings and can keep spending even in—so I think those two things do tend to wage—to sort of counterbalance each other out. It appears, consumer spending is still positive—it’s at pretty modest growth levels. It’s not shrinking. The banks that deal with retail customers and many retailers will tell you that the consumers are still buying and they’re still—they’re fine. So I don’t know how big the fiscal headwinds are, and they haven’t shown up in the way that we thought they would in restraining spending. So it must have to do with the savings that people have.","Q&A","Press Conf","","124","2022-11"
"2022-11-02","Demand is going to have some support from those savings and also from the strong demand that’s still in the labor market. We still see pretty significant demand and a tightening labor market in some respects, although I think, overall, I would say it’s not really tightening or loosening. So we see those things, and what those things tell us is that our job is going to require some resolve and some patience over time. We’re going to have to stick with this. And that’s just—we take all that as a given, but we know what our objective is, and we know what our tools can do, and that’s how we think about it.","Q&A","Press Conf","","114","2022-11"
"2022-11-02","Has it narrowed? Yes. Is it still possible? Yes. We’ve always said it was going to be difficult, but I think to the extent rates have to go higher and stay higher for longer, it becomes harder to see the path—it’s narrowed. I would say the path has narrowed over the course of the last year, really. Hard to say. Hard to say. Again, I would say that the sort of array of data in the labor market is highly unusual and, to many economists, there is a path to— ordinarily there’s a relationship to GDP going down and vacancies declining, translating into unemployment, or there’s Okun’s law. So all those things are relationships that are in the data, and they’re very real. Data’s a little bit different this time, though, because you have this tremendously high level of vacancies and, we think, on a very steep part of the Beveridge curve. All I would say is that the job losses may turn out to be less than would be indicated by those traditional measures, because job openings are so elevated and because the labor market is so strong. Again, that’s going to be something we discover empirically. I think no one knows whether there’s going to be a recession or not and, if so, how bad that recession would be. And our job is to restore price stability so that we can have a strong labor market that benefits all over time. And that’s what we’re going to do.","Q&A","Press Conf","","250","2022-11"
"2022-11-02","Because we haven’t seen inflation coming down. The implication of inflation not coming down. What we would expect by now to have seen is that as the—really, as the supply-side problems have resolved themselves, we would have expected goods inflation to services inflation moving up, and I just think that the inflation picture has become more and more challenging over the course of this year, without question. That means that we have to have policy be more restrictive, and that narrows the path to a soft landing, I would say. Thanks very much.","Q&A","Press Conf","","93","2022-11"
"2022-11-02","Is inflation becoming entrenched? So I guess I would start by pointing to expectations. So if we saw longer-term expectations moving up, that would be very troubling. And they were moving up a little bit at the middle part of this year, and they’ve moved now back down. That’s one piece of data. Shorter-term inflation expectations moved up between the last meeting and this meeting, and we don’t think those are as indicative, but they may be important in the wage-setting process. There’s a school of thought that believes that. So that’s very concerning. I guess the other thing I would say is that the longer we have—we’re now 18 months into this episode of high inflation, and we don’t have a clearly identified, scientific way of under control—get it down to 2 percent—get it behind us. That’s what we really need to do and what we’re strongly committed to doing.","Q&A","Press Conf","","151","2022-11"
"2022-11-02","So the way I would think about that is, it’s commonly, for a long time, thought that monetary policy works with “long and variable lags,” and that it works first on financial conditions and then on economic activity and then perhaps later than that even on inflation. So that’s been the thinking for a long time. There was an old literature that made those lags out to be fairly long. There’s newer literature that says that they’re shorter. The truth is, we don’t have a lot of data [consisting] of inflation of [rates] this high in what is, now, the modern economy. One big difference now is that it used to be that you would raise the federal funds rate, financial conditions would react, and then that would affect economic activity and inflation. Now financial conditions react well before in expectation of monetary policy [actions]. That’s the way it has moved for a quarter of a century—in the direction of financial conditions, then monetary policy—because the markets are thinking, what is the central bank going to do? And there are plenty of economists that also think that once financial conditions change, that the effects on the economy are actually faster than they would have been before. We don’t know But you want to consider them but not take them literally. So I think it’s a very difficult place to be, but I would tend to be—want to be in the middle looking carefully at what’s actually happening with the economy and trying to make good decisions from a risk-management standpoint, remembering, of course, that if we were to overtighten, we could then use our tools strongly to support the economy, whereas if we don’t get inflation under control because we don’t tighten enough, now we’re in a situation where inflation will become entrenched and the costs, the employment costs in particular, will be much higher potentially. So from a risk- management standpoint, we want to be sure that we don’t make the mistake of either failing to tighten enough or loosening policy too soon.","Q&A","Press Conf","","344","2022-11"
"2022-11-02","I don’t know that the channels through which policy works have changed that much. I would say a big channel is the labor market, and the labor market is very, very strong. Very strong. And households, of course, have strong balance sheets. So we go into this with a strong labor market and excess demand in the labor market, as you can see through many different things, and also with households who have strong spending power built up. So it may take time, it may take resolve, it may take patience. It’s likely to, to get inflation down. It may—I think you see, from our forecasts and others, that it will take some time for inflation to come down. It’ll take time, we think. So, sorry, was I getting to your question there?","Q&A","Press Conf","","133","2022-11"
"2022-11-02","Oh, housing—the housing part of it. Yes, so we look at housing—of course, housing is significantly affected by these higher rates, which are really back where they were before the Global Financial Crisis—they’re not historically high, but they’re much higher housing was—the housing market was very overheated for the couple of years after the pandemic as demand increased and rates were low. We all know the stories of how overheated the housing market was, prices going up. Many, many bidders and no conditions, that kind of thing. So the housing market needs to get back into a balance between supply and demand. We’re well aware of what’s going on there. From a financial stability standpoint, we didn’t see in this cycle the kinds of poor credit underwriting that we saw before the Global Financial Crisis. Housing credit was very carefully—much more carefully managed by the lenders. So it’s a very different situation and doesn’t present potential financial—doesn’t appear to present financial stability issues. But, no, we do understand that that’s really where a very big effect of our policy is.","Q&A","Press Conf","","180","2022-11"
"2022-11-02","So we talk a lot about vacancies in the—vacancy-to-unemployed rate, but it’s just one, it’s just another data series. It’s been unusually important in this cycle because it’s been so out of line. But so has quits. So have wages. So we look at a very wide range of data on the unemployment—on the labor market. So I’d start with unemployment, we had really thought, we thought we would get that back. Most analysts thought we would get some labor supply coming in. You mentioned wages, so I guess I would characterize that as sort of a mixed picture. It’s true, with average hourly earnings, you see—so I would call it a flattening out at a level that’s well above the level that would be consistent over time with 2 percent inflation, assuming a reasonable productivity. With the ECI reading this week, again, a mixed picture. The headline number was a disappointment. Let’s just say it was high. It didn’t show a decline. There’s some rays of light inside that if you look at private-sector workers—that did come down, that compensation did come down. Overall, though, the broader picture is of an overheated labor market where demand substantially exceeds supply. Job creation still exceeds sort of the level that would hold the market where it is. So that’s the picture. Do we see—we keep looking for signs that sort of the beginning of a gradual softening is happening. And maybe that’s there, but it’s not obvious to me, because wages aren’t coming down—they’re just moving sideways at an elevated level, both ECI and average hourly earnings. We want to see—we would love to see vacancies coming down, quits coming down. They are coming down. Vacancies are below their all-time high but not by as much as we thought, because—and the data series is volatile, we never take any one reading, we always look at two or three. So it’s a mixed picture. I don’t see the case for real softening just yet. But we look at, I guess as I just showed you, we look at a very broad range of data on the labor market.","Q&A","Press Conf","","356","2022-11"
"2022-11-02","So, of course, we, we keep close tabs on economic developments and also geopolitical developments that are relevant to the economy abroad. We’re in very frequent contact with our foreign counterparts both through the IMF meetings and the regular meetings with central banks that we have, and I have one this weekend with many, many central bankers. So we’re in touch with all of that. So I guess what—it’s clearly a time, a difficult time in the global economy. We’re seeing very high inflation in Europe, significantly because of high energy prices related to the war in Ukraine. And we’re seeing China’s having issues with the take all of that into account in our models. We think about the spillovers and that sort of thing. Here in the United States, we have a strong economy, and we have an economy where inflation is running at 5 percent. Core PCE inflation—which is a really good indicator of what’s going on for us, the way we see it—is running at 5.1 percent on a 12-month basis and sort of similar to that on a 3-, 6-, and 9-month basis. So we know that we need to use our tools to get inflation under control. The world’s not going to be better off if we fail to do that. That’s a task we need to do. Price stability in the United States is a good thing for the global economy over a long period of time. Price stability is the kind of thing that pays dividends for our economy—for decades, hopefully—even though it may be difficult to get it back. Getting it back is something that gives—that provides value to the people we serve for the long run.","Q&A","Press Conf","","285","2022-11"
"2022-11-02","So we don’t directly affect, for the most part, food and energy prices, but the demand channel does affect them just at the margin. The thing about the United States is that we also have strong—in many other jurisdictions, the principal problem really is energy. In the United States, we also have a demand issue. We’ve got an imbalance between demand and supply, which you see in many parts of the economy. So our tools are well suited to work on that problem, and that’s what we’re doing. You’re right, though. We don’t—the price of oil is inflation by the things that we do, even in times when energy is part of the story of why inflation is high.","Q&A","Press Conf","","119","2022-11"
"2022-11-02","Sure. So you’re right—the public’s trust is really the Fed’s and any central bank’s most important asset, and any time one of us, one of the policymakers, violates or falls short of those rules, we do risk undermining that trust, and we take that very seriously. We do. So at the beginning of our meeting yesterday, actually, we had a Committee discussion of the full Committee on the importance of holding ourselves individually and collectively accountable for knowing and following the high standard that’s set out in our existing rules with respect to both personal investment activities and external communications. And we’ve taken a number of steps, and I would just say we do understand how important those issues are. I would say that our new investment program that we have is up now and running, and, actually, it was through that that the problems with President Bostic’s disclosures were discovered, when he filed his new disclosure. We now have a central group here at the Board of Governors that looks into disclosures and follows them and approves people’s disclosures and also all of their trades. Any really good system. It worked here. And we—I think we all said to each other today— yesterday, actually, yesterday morning, we recommitted to each other and to this institution to hold ourselves to the highest standards and avoid these problems.","Q&A","Press Conf","","227","2022-11"

"2022-12-14","Good afternoon. Before I go into the details of today’s meeting, I would like to underscore for the American people that we understand the hardship that high inflation is causing and that we are strongly committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal. Over the course of the year, we have taken forceful actions to tighten the stance of monetary policy. We have covered a lot of ground, and the full effects of our rapid tightening so far are yet to be felt. Even so, we have more work to do. Price stability is the responsibility of the Federal Reserve and serves as the bedrock of our economy. Without price stability, the economy doesn’t work for anyone. In particular, without price stability, we will not achieve a sustained period of strong labor market conditions that benefit all. Today, the FOMC raised our policy interest rate by ½ percentage point. We continue to anticipate that ongoing increases will be appropriate in order to attain a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2 percent over time. In addition, we are continuing the process of significantly reducing the size of our balance sheet. Restoring price stability will likely require maintaining a restrictive policy stance for some time.

"2022-12-14","So, as I mentioned, it is important that overall financial conditions continue to reflect the policy restraint that we’re putting in place to bring inflation down to 2 percent. We think that financial conditions have tightened significantly in the past year. But our policy actions work through financial conditions. And those, in turn, affect economic activity, the labor market, and inflation. So what we control is our policy moves in the communications that we make. Financial conditions both anticipate, and react to, our actions. I would add that our focus is not on short-term moves, but on persistent moves. And many, many things, of course, move financial conditions over time. I would say it’s our judgment today that we’re not at a sufficiently restrictive policy stance yet, which is why we say that we would expect that ongoing hikes would be appropriate. And I would point you to the SEP again for our current assessment of what that peak level will be. As you will have seen, 19 people filled out the SEP this time, and 17 of those 19 wrote down a peak rate of 5 percent or more—in the 5s. So that’s our best assessment today for what we think the peak rate will be. was published shows again that, overwhelmingly, FOMC participants believe that inflation risks are to the upside. So I can’t tell you confidently that we won’t move up our estimate of the peak rate again at the next","Q&A","Press Conf","","244","2022-12"
"2022-12-14","So, as I’ve been saying, as we’ve gone through the course of this year, as we lifted off and got into the course of the year and we saw the—how strong inflation was and how persistent, it was very important to move quickly. In fact, the speed—the pace with which we’re moving was the most important thing. I think now that we’re coming to the end of this year, we’ve raised 425 basis points this year, and we’re into restrictive territory. It’s now not so important how fast we go. It’s far more important to think, what is the ultimate level? And then it’s—at a certain point, the question will become, how long do we remain restrictive? That will become the most important question. But I would say the most important question now is no longer the speed. So—and that applies to February as well. So I decision. But, ultimately, that question about how high to raise rates is going to be one that we make looking at our progress on inflation, looking at where financial conditions are, and making an assessment of whether policy is restrictive enough. [As] I’ve told you today, we have an assessment that we’re not at a restrictive enough stance, even with today’s move. And we’ve laid out our own—our individual assessments of what we would need to do to get there. At a certain point, though, we’ll get to that point. And then the question will be, how long do we stay there? And there, the strong view on the Committee is that we’ll need to stay there, you know, until we’re really confident that inflation is coming down in a sustained way. And we think that that will be some time. Now, why do I say that? If you look at—you can break inflation down into three, sort of, buckets. The first is goods inflation, and we see now, as we’ve been expecting, really, for a year and a half, that supply conditions would get better. And, ultimately, supply chains get fixed, and demand settles down a little bit and maybe goes back to services a little bit. And we start to see goods inflation coming down. We’re now starting to see that in this report and the last one. Then you go to housing services. We know the story there is that housing services inflation has been very, very high and will continue to go up, actually. As rents expire and have to be renewed, they’re going to be renewed into a market where rates are higher than they were when the original leases were signed. But we see that the new leases that are—that the rate for new leases is coming down. So, once we work our way through that backlog, that inflation will function of the labor market, largely. The biggest cost, by far, in that sector is labor. And we do see a very, very strong labor market, one where we haven’t seen much softening, where job growth is very high, where wages are very high. Vacancies are quite elevated, and, really, there’s an imbalance in the labor market between supply and demand. So that part of it, which is the biggest part, is likely to take a substantial period to get down. The other—you know, the goods inflation has turned pretty quickly now after not turning at all for a year and a half. Now it seems to be turning. But there’s an expectation, really, that the services inflation will not move down so quickly, so that we’ll have to stay at it, so that we may have to raise rates higher to get to where we want to go. And that’s really why we are writing down those high rates and why we’re expecting that they’ll have to remain high for a time.","Q&A","Press Conf","","636","2022-12"
"2022-12-14","Well, I’ll tell you what the projection is. I don’t think it would qualify as a recession, though, because you’ve got positive growth. The expectations in the SEP are basically as you said, which is, we’ve got growth at a modest level, which is to say that In that condition, labor market conditions are softening a bit. Unemployment does go up a bit. I would say that many analysts believe that the natural rate of unemployment is actually elevated at this moment. So it’s not clear that those forecasts of inflation are really much above the natural rate of unemployment. We can never identify its location with great precision. But that 4.7 percent is still a strong labor market. If you look—you know, you’ve got—the reports we get from the field are that companies are very reluctant to lay people off, other than the tech companies, which is, you know, a story unto itself. Generally, companies want to hold onto the workers they have because it’s been very, very hard to hire. So you’ve got all these vacancies out there—far in excess of the number of employed people. That doesn’t sound like a—you know, a labor market where a lot of people will need to be put out of work. So that we—you know, there are channels through which the labor market can come back into balance with relatively modest increases in unemployment, we believe. None of that is guaranteed, but that is what their forecast reflects.","Q&A","Press Conf","","247","2022-12"
"2022-12-14","No. Absolutely not. No. As a—just a matter of practice, the SEP reflects any data that’s—that comes out during the meeting. And participants know that they have the—they know this—that they can make changes to their SEP during the meeting, you know, well in advance of the press conference so that we’re not running around. But that’s not the case. It’s never the case that the SEPs don’t reflect an important piece of data that came in on the first day of the meeting.","Q&A","Press Conf","","84","2022-12"
"2022-12-14","No. It’s not about the strength of the labor market. The labor market is clearly very strong. It is more just that, you know, by now, we had expected—we’ve continually expected to make faster progress on inflation than we have, ultimately. And that’s why the peak rate for this year goes up between this meeting and the September meeting. You see that—you see the fact that we’ve made less progress than expected on inflation. So that’s why that goes up. And that’s why unemployment goes up, because we’re having to tighten policy more. And so it didn’t go up by much in the meeting, I don’t think. But that’s the idea, is slower progress on inflation, tighter policy, probably higher rates probably held for longer just to get to where you—the kind of restriction that you need to get inflation down to 2 percent.","Q&A","Press Conf","","144","2022-12"
"2022-12-14","It’s very hard to say. You know, there—you can look at history, right? And history would, you know, would say that, in a situation like this, the declines in unemployment would be more meaningful, I think, than what you see written down there. But why do we think that is the case? So, I’ll give you a few reasons. First just is that there’s this huge overhang of vacancies, meaning that vacancies can come down a fair amount. And we’re hearing from many companies that they don’t want to lay people off—so that they’ll keep people because it’s been so hard. I mean, I think we’ve—it feels like we have a structural labor shortage out there where there are, you know, 4 million fewer people, a little more than 4 million who were in the may take longer, but it also means that the costs in unemployment may be less. Again, that we’re going to find out empirically. But I think that’s a reasonably possible outcome. And you do hear, you know, many, many labor economists believe that it is. So we’ll see, though.","Q&A","Press Conf","","184","2022-12"
"2022-12-14","Well, I think that’s why one of the reasons it went up was that core came in stronger this year. Yeah. What you see is our best estimate, as of today—really, as of today—for how high we need to raise rates to—how much we need to tighten policy to create enough, you know, restrictive policy to slow economic activity and slow—soften the labor market and bring inflation down through those channels. That’s all—that is the estimate—best estimate—we make today. And, as I mentioned, we’ll make another estimate for the next","Q&A","Press Conf","","90","2022-12"
"2022-12-14","Following several months of tightening, financial conditions eased over the period as investor concerns about global risks edged lower and incoming data showed nascent signs of a moderation in inflationary pressures.","Developments in Financial Markets","Minutes","N/A","31","2022-12"
"2022-12-14","We’re going into next year with higher inflation than we had thought, right? So we’re actually moving down to—the level that we’re moving down to next year is still a very large drop in inflation from where inflation is running now, well more than 1 percent change in inflation. But remember that the jump[ing]-off point at the beginning of the year is higher. So, you know, we—we’re moving down still by a very large chunk. I don’t think it’s having—I don’t think the policy is having any less effect. It’s just starting from a higher level at the end of 2022. So we’re getting down. I believe the median is 3½ percent. That would be—that’s a pretty significant drop in inflation. And, you know, where’s it coming from? It’s coming from the goods sector, clearly. By the middle of next year, we should begin to see lower inflation from the housing services sector. And then, you know, the big question is, when we—how much will you see from the largest, the 55 percent of the index, which is the non-housing services sector? And, you know, that’s where you need to see—we believe you need to see a better balancing of supply and demand in the labor market so that you have—it’s not that we don’t want wage increases. We want strong wage increases. We just want them to be at a level that’s consistent with 2 percent inflation. Right now that—if you put into—if you factor in productivity estimates, standard productivity estimates, wages are running, you know, well above what would be consistent with 2 percent inflation.","Q&A","Press Conf","","267","2022-12"
"2022-12-14","So you’re right. Those two things will offset each other. Weaker output in China will push down on commodity prices, but it could interfere with supply chains ultimately. And that could push inflation up in the West. It’s very hard to say, you know, how much—how those two will offset each other. And it doesn’t seem likely, actually, that the overall net effect would be material on us. But, to your point, China faces a very challenging situation in reopening. You know, we’ve seen, waves of COVID all around the world can interfere with economic activity. China, a very critical manufacturing—place for manufacturing significant increases in","Q&A","Press Conf","","106","2022-12"
"2022-12-14","Right. So the data that we’ve received so far for October and November, we don’t have the—some of the—we have some remaining data to get in November, but they clearly do show a welcome reduction in the monthly pace of price increases. As I mentioned in my opening statement, it will take substantially more evidence to give confidence that inflation is on a sustained downward path. So the way we think about this is this: This report is very much in line with what we’ve been expecting and hoping for. And what it does is, it provides greater confidence in our forecast of declining inflation. As I mentioned, we’ve been expecting significant—forecasting significant declines in overall inflation and core inflation in the coming year. And this is the kind of reading that it will take to support that. So, really, this gives us greater confidence in our forecasts rather than, at this point, changing our forecast. In terms of the pieces, we have been expecting goods inflation to come down as supply chain pressures eased. That’s happening now. Housing services—as I should help. And the big piece, again, is core services, ex housing, which is very important. And we have a ways to go there. You do see some beginning signs there. But, ultimately, that’s the big—the more than half, as I mentioned, of PCE core index. And it’s very fundamentally about the labor market and wages. If you look at wages, look at the average hourly earnings number we got with the last payrolls report, you don’t really see much progress in terms of average hourly earnings coming down. Now, there may be composition effects and other effects in that. So we don’t put too much weight on any one report. These things can be volatile month to month. But we will be looking for wages moving, you know, down to more normal levels where workers are doing well and, ultimately, their gains are not being eaten up by inflation.","Q&A","Press Conf","","331","2022-12"
"2022-12-14","So if I—I think I got your question. So, you know, one thing is to say is, I think our policy’s in—getting into a pretty good place now. We’re restrictive, and I think we’re—you know, we’re getting close to that level of sufficient—we think—sufficiently welcome these better inflation reports for the last two months. They’re very welcome. But I think we’re realistic about the broader project. So that’s all. That’s the point I would make. It’s—you know, we see goods prices coming down. We understand what will happen with housing services. But the big story will really be the rest of it, and there’s not much progress there. And that’s going to take some time. I think my view and my colleagues’ view is that this will take some time. We’ll have to hold policy at a restrictive level for a sustained period so that, you know, two good—you know, two good monthly reports are, you know, very welcome. Of course, they’re very welcome. But we need to be honest with ourselves that there’s, you know, inflation—12-month core inflation is 6 percent","Q&A","Press Conf","","182","2022-12"
"2022-12-14","No, I wouldn’t say that. No. I don’t say that. I mean, I would say this: You know, to the extent we need to keep rates higher and keep them there for longer and inflation, you know, moves up higher and higher, I think that narrows the runway. But lower inflation readings, if they persist, in time, could certainly make it more possible. So I just—I don’t think anyone knows whether we’re going to have a recession or not and, if we do, whether it’s going to be a deep one or not. It’s just, it’s not knowable. And certainly, you know, lower inflation reports, were they to continue for a period of time, would increase the likelihood of a— put it this way, of a return to price stability that involves significantly less of an increase in unemployment than would be expected given the historical record. Americans of pain earlier this year as the Fed hikes rates. But with the Fed now expected to raise rates higher than you thought when you first said that, just wondering where we are in that pain. How would you describe that to Americans if the projections on unemployment find themselves—that’d be 1.6 million Americans out of jobs?","Q&A","Press Conf","","205","2022-12"
"2022-12-14","So the largest amount of pain—the worst pain would come from a failure to raise rates high enough and from us allowing inflation to become entrenched in the economy so that the ultimate cost of getting it out of the economy would be very high in terms of employment, meaning very high unemployment for extended periods of time, the kind of thing that had to happen when inflation really got out of control and the Fed didn’t respond aggressively enough or soon enough in a prior episode, you know, 50 years ago. So that’s really—the worst pain would be if we failed to act. What we’re doing now is, you know, it’s raising interest rates for people. And so people are paying higher rates on mortgages and that kind of thing. There will be some softening in labor market conditions. And I wish there were a completely painless way to restore price stability. There isn’t. And this is the best we can do. I do think, though, that—and markets are pretty confident, it seems to me—that we will get inflation under control. And I believe we will. We’re certainly highly committed to do that.","Q&A","Press Conf","","194","2022-12"
"2022-12-14","That’s just—so, changing our inflation goal is just something we’re not thinking about, and it’s something we’re not going to think about. It’s—we have a 2 percent inflation goal, and we’ll use our tools to get inflation back to 2 percent. I think this isn’t the time to be thinking about that. I mean, there may be a longer-run project at some point. But that is not where we are at all. The Committee—we’re not considering that. We’re not going to consider that under any circumstances. We’re going to keep our inflation target at 2 percent. We’re going to use our tools to get inflation back to 2 percent.","Q&A","Press Conf","","109","2022-12"
"2022-12-14","So the—I would go back to the labor market that we had in 2018, ’19, ’20. So, what that looked like was, wage increases for the people at the lowest end of the income spectrum were the largest. The gaps between racial groups and gender groups were at their smallest in recorded history. That’s—and all of that because of a tight labor market, a tight labor market which had inflation running, you know, just a tick below 2 percent and the economy growing right at its potential. So that seems like something that would be really good for the economy and for the country, if we could get back to that. And so that’s what all of us want to do. We want to get back to a long expansion where the labor market can remain strong over an extended period of price stability. But we, you know, we can’t—what we have to think about is the medium and longer term. If you think about it, the country went through a difficult time—I think much more difficult than we can think it would happen here. But it really set up our economy for several decades of prosperity. So price stability is something that really pays dividends for the benefit of the economy and the people in it over a very, very long period of time. And so when it is lost, for whatever reason, it has to be restored and as quickly as possible—which is what we’re doing.","Q&A","Press Conf","","248","2022-12"
"2022-12-14","You know, our focus right now is really on moving our policy stance to one that is restrictive enough to ensure a return of inflation to our 2 percent goal over time. It’s not on rate cuts. And we think that we’ll have to maintain a restrictive stance of policy for some time. Historical experience cautions strongly against prematurely loosening policy. I guess I would say it this way: I wouldn’t see us considering rate cuts until the Committee is confident that inflation is moving down to 2 percent in a sustained way. So that’s the test I would articulate. And you’re correct. There are not rate cuts in the SEP for 2023.","Q&A","Press Conf","","113","2022-12"

"2022-12-14","So we do know that. Of course, that’s something that we know we’d see. But, as I mentioned, you know, we wouldn’t—I wouldn’t see the Committee cutting rates until we’re confident that inflation is moving down in a sustained way. That would be my test. I don’t see us as having a really clear and precise understanding of what the neutral rate is and what real rates are so that it would mechanically happen like that. It would—really, it’ll be a test of—for cutting rates, I think, in the event, it’ll be a question of, do we actually feel confident that inflation is coming down in a sustained way? Thank you very much.","Q&A","Press Conf","","113","2022-12"
"2022-12-14","No. I mean, what we do is, we make our forecasts, and we publish them quarterly. And, you know, if you look at those forecasts, those are forecasts for slow growth, for a softening labor market, by which I mean, unemployment goes up but not a great deal. And you see inflation coming down. You see rates going up a lot. You see inflation coming down. Those are those forecasts, and that’s really what they show. We’re not—of course, we don’t talk about, you know, this kind of a recession and that kind of a recession. We just, you know, we make those forecasts. The staff runs—and you will see this if you look at the old Tealbooks—runs alternative simulations of all different kinds at every meeting, and we look at those, too.

"2022-12-14","So, what I meant by that, with “structural labor shortage,” is, if you look at where we are now, as I mentioned, there—if you just look at demand for labor, you can look at vacancies plus people who are actually working. And then you can take supply of labor by, “Are you in the labor market?” “Are you looking for a job or have a job?” And you’re 4— more than 4 million people short. We don’t see—despite very high wages and an incredibly tight labor market, we don’t see participation moving up—which is contrary to what we thought. So the upshot of all that is, the labor market is actually—it should—it’s 3½ million people, at least, smaller than it should have been based on pre-pandemic. Just assume population and reasonable growth and aging of the population; our labor force should be 3½ million more than it is. And that—there’re lots of easy ways to get to bigger numbers than that if you go back a few more years. So why is that? Part of it is just accelerated retirements. People dropped out and aren’t coming back at a higher rate than expected. Part of it is that we lost a half a million We don’t prescribe—you know, it’s not our job to prescribe things. But, you know, I think if you ask businesses, you know, pretty much everybody you talk to says there aren’t enough people. We need more people. So I tried to identify that in my—in a speech I gave a month ago, but I stopped short of telling Congress what to do because, you know, they gave us a job.

You’re near a 50-year low where you’re at or above maximum employment, a 50-year low in unemployment, vacancies are very high, wages—nominal wages getting inflation under control, and that’s what we’ll do.

"2023-01-10","Central bank independence and transparencyOn the first point, the case for monetary policy independence lies in the benefits of insulating monetary policy decisions from short-term political considerations.1Price stability is the bedrock of a healthy economy and provides the public with immeasurable benefits over time.","General","Speech","N/A","44","2023-01"
"2023-02-01","So your question is, would we—say your question again.","Q&A","Press Conf","","9","2023-02"
"2023-02-01","We—you know, you’ll see that the minutes will come out in three weeks, and we’ll give you a lot of detail. I—you know, we spend a lot of time talking about the path ahead and the state of the economy. And I wouldn’t want to start to drive the—describe all the details there, but that was the sense of the discussion, was really talking quite a bit about the path forward.","Q&A","Press Conf","","71","2023-02"
"2023-02-01","So we’ve—you know, we’ve raised rates 4½ percentage points, and we’re talking about a couple of more rate hikes to get to that level we think is appropriately restrictive. And why do we think that’s probably necessary? We think, because inflation is still running very hot. We’re, of course, taking into account long and variable lags, and we’re thinking about that. It really—the story we’re telling about inflation is to ourselves, and the way we understand it is basically the three things that I’ve just gone through a couple of times. And, know that. So I think we’re—you know, we’re living in a world of significant uncertainty. I would look across the rate—the spectrum of rates and see that real rates are now positive by— you know, by an appropriate set of measures are positive across the yield curve. I think policy is restrictive. We’re trying to make a fine judgment about how much is restrictive enough. That’s all. And we’re going to—you know, that’s why we’re slowing down to 25 basis points. We’re going to be carefully watching the economy and watching inflation and watching the progress of the disinflationary process.","Q&A","Press Conf","","192","2023-02"
"2023-02-01","So I guess I would say it this way. We can now say, I think, for the first time that the disinflationary process has started. We can see that. And we see it, really, in goods prices so far. Goods prices is a big sector. We—this is what we thought would happen since the very beginning, and now here it is actually happening, and for the reasons we thought. We—you know, it’s supply chains, it’s shortages, and it’s demand revolving back towards services. So this is a good thing. This is a good thing. But that’s, you know, around a quarter of the PCE price index—core PCE price index. So the second sector is housing services, and that’s driven by very different things. And we—as I mentioned, with housing services, we expect, and other forecasters expect, that measured inflation will continue moving up for several months but will then come down, assuming that [rent increases associated with] new leases continue to be soft. And we do assume that. So we think that that’s sort of in the pipeline. And we actually see disinflation in the goods sector, and we see it in the pipeline for two sectors that amount to a little less than half. So this is good. And we note that when we say inflation is coming down that this is good. We expect to see that that disinflation process will be seen, we hope soon, in the core goods ex. housing—sorry, the core services ex. housing sector that I talked about. We don’t see it yet. It’s—you know, it’s seven or eight different kinds of services, not all of them are the same. And, you know, we have a sense of what’s going on in each of those different subsections. Probably the biggest part of it, probably 60 percent of that is, you know, research would show is sensitive to slack in the economy and so the labor market will probably be we need to see that it’s the majority of the core PCE index, which is the thing that we think is the best predictor of headline PCE, which is [the price series that we associate with] our mandate. So it’s not that we’re not—we’re neither optimistic nor pessimistic. We’re just telling you that we don’t see inflation moving down yet in that large sector. I think we will fairly soon, but we don’t see it yet. Until we do, I think we—you know, we see ourselves, we’ve got to be honest with ourselves, but we see ourselves as having perhaps more persistent—we’ll see more persistent inflation in that sector, which will take longer to get down. And we’re just going to have to—we have to complete the job. You know, that’s what we’re here for.","Q&A","Press Conf","","460","2023-02"
"2023-02-01","I guess I would say it this way. I continue to think that it’s very difficult to manage the risk of doing too little and finding out in 6 or 12 months that we actually were close but didn’t get the job done. Inflation springs back, and we have to go back in. And now, you really do worry about expectations getting unanchored and that kind of thing. This is a inflation is coming down faster than we expect, then we have tools that would work on that. So I do think that, in this situation, where we have still the highest inflation in 40 years, you know, the job is not fully done. As I started to mention earlier, we have a sector that represents 56 percent of the core inflation index where we don’t see disinflation yet. So we don’t see it. It’s not happening yet. Inflation in the core services ex. housing is still running at 4 percent on a 6- and 12-month basis. So there’s not—nothing happening there. In the other two sectors representing, you know, less than 50 percent, you actually, I think, now have a story that is credible, that’s coming together, although you don’t actually see disinflation yet in housing services, but it’s in the pipeline, right? So, for the third sector, we don’t see anything here. So I think it would be premature—it would be very premature to declare victory or to think that we’ve really got this. We need to see—our goal, of course, is to bring inflation down. And how do we get that done? There are many, many factors driving inflation in that sector, and they should be coming into play to have inflation—the disinflationary process begin in that sector. But, so far, we don’t see that. And I think until we do, we see ourselves as having a lot of work left to do.","Q&A","Press Conf","","316","2023-02"
"2023-02-01","So you’re right about the data, of course. What we did see—we’ve seen average hourly earnings and now the employment cost index abating a little bit still off of their highs of six months ago and more but still at levels that are fairly elevated. The job openings number has—in JOLTS, has been quite volatile recently. Yeah, I did see that it moved up—back up this morning. I do think that it’s probably an important indicator. The ratio, I guess, is back up to 1.9 job openings to unemployed people, people who are looking for work. So it’s an indicator, but nonetheless, we—you’re right, we do see wages moving down. If you look across the rest of the labor market, you still see very high payroll job creation. And, you know, quits are still at an elevated level. So many, many—by many, many indicators, the job market is still very strong.","Q&A","Press Conf","","151","2023-02"
"2023-02-01","No. We’re going to write down new forecasts at the March meeting, and we’ll see at that time. I will say that it is gratifying to see the disinflationary process now","Q&A","Press Conf","","31","2023-02"
"2023-02-01","So I would say it is a good thing that the disinflation that we have seen so far has not come at the expense of a weaker labor market. But I would also say that that disinflationary process that you now see under way is really at an early stage. What you see is, really, in the goods sector you see inflation now coming down because supply chains have been fixed, demand is shifting back to services, and shortages have been abated. So you see that. In the other—in the housing services sector, we expect inflation to continue moving up for a while but then to come down, assuming that [rent increases associated with] new leases continue to be lower. So, in those two sectors, you’ve got a good story. The issue is that we have a large sector called nonhousing service—core nonhousing services, where we don’t see disinflation yet. But I would say that, so far, what we see is progress but without any weakening in labor market conditions.","Q&A","Press Conf","","170","2023-02"
"2023-02-01","So it is important that overall financial conditions continue to reflect the policy restraint that we’re putting in place in order to bring inflation down to 2 percent. And, of course, financial conditions have tightened very significantly over the past year. I would say that our focus is not on short-term moves but on sustained changes to broader financial conditions. And it is our judgment that we’re not yet at a sufficiently restrictive policy stance, which is why we say that we expect ongoing hikes will be appropriate. Of course, many things affect financial conditions—not just our policy. And we will take into account overall financial conditions along with many other factors as we set policy.","Q&A","Press Conf","","116","2023-02"
"2023-02-01","Good afternoon, and welcome. My colleagues and I understand the hardship that high inflation is causing, and we are strongly committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal. Over the past year, we have taken forceful actions to tighten the stance of monetary policy. We have covered a lot of ground, and the full effects of our rapid tightening so far are yet to be felt. Even so, we have more work to do. Price stability is the responsibility of the Federal Reserve and serves as the bedrock of our economy. Without price stability, the economy does not work for anyone. In particular, without price stability, we will not achieve a sustained period of labor market conditions that benefit all. Today, the FOMC raised our policy interest rate by 25 basis points. We continue to anticipate that ongoing increases will be appropriate in order to attain a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2 percent over time. In addition, we are continuing the process of significantly reducing the size of our balance sheet. Restoring price stability will likely require maintaining a restrictive stance for some time. I will have more to say about today’s monetary policy actions after briefly reviewing economic developments. The","Opening Statement","Press Conf","","212","2023-02"
"2023-02-01","So you’re right. At the December meeting, we all wrote down our best estimates of what we thought the ultimate level would be, and that’s obviously back in December. And the median for that was between 5 and 5¼ percent. At the March meeting, we’re going to update those assessments. We did not update them today. We did, however, continue to say that we believe ongoing rate hikes will be appropriate to attain a sufficiently restrictive stance of policy to bring inflation back down to 2 percent. We think we’ve covered a lot of ground, and financial conditions have certainly tightened. I would say we still think there’s work to do there. We haven’t made a decision on exactly where that will be. I think, you know, we’re going to be looking carefully at the incoming data between now and the March meeting and then the May meeting. I don’t feel a lot of certainty about where that will be. It could certainly be higher than we’re writing down right now. If we come to the view that we need to write down to, you know, to move rates up beyond what we said in December, we would certainly do that. At the same time, if the data come in, in the other direction, then we’ll, you know, we’ll make data-dependent decisions at coming meetings, of course.","Q&A","Press Conf","","227","2023-02"
"2023-02-01","So you’re really asking about—you’re asking about prioritization, in effect, is what—","Q&A","Press Conf","","12","2023-02"
"2023-02-01","I’m just going to leave it at that. This is a matter that’s to be resolved between, really—it’s really Congress’ job to raise the debt ceiling. And I gather there are discussions happening, but they don’t involve us. We’re not involved in those discussions. So we’re the fiscal agent.","Q&A","Press Conf","","49","2023-02"
"2023-02-01","So the Committee obviously did not see this as the time to pause. We judged that the appropriate, you know, thing to do at this meeting was to raise the federal funds rate by 25 basis points. And we said that we continue to anticipate that ongoing increases in the target range will be appropriate in order to attain that stance of sufficiently restrictive monetary policy that will bring inflation down to 2 percent. So that’s the judgment that we made. You know, we’re going to write down new forecasts in March, and we’ll—you know, we’ll certainly be looking at the incoming data as everyone else will.","Q&A","Press Conf","","107","2023-02"
"2023-02-01","Look, I—it’s very hard to think about all the different possible ramifications. And I think the answer is, basically, I don’t think there’s likely to be any important interaction between the two, because I believe Congress will wind up acting, and—as it will and must, in the end, to raise the debt ceiling in a way that doesn’t risk, you know, the progress we’re making against inflation and the economy and the financial sector. I believe that that will happen. I believe it will happen. You know, we, of course, will monitor money market conditions carefully as—you know, as the process moves on. For example, the Treasury General Account will shrink down, and then it will grow back up. And we understand there’ll be lots of flows between there and the overnight repo facility and reserves. We understand all that. We’re watching it carefully. We’ll just be monitoring it. Thank you very much.","Q&A","Press Conf","","153","2023-02"
"2023-02-01","So a couple of things. First, on the forecast, if—you’re right—if you take very short-term three-month, say, measures of PCE—core PCE inflation, they’re quite low right now. But that’s because that’s driven by, you know, significantly negative readings from goods inflation. Most forecasters would think that the significantly negative readings will be transitory and that goods inflation will move up fairly soon, back up to its longer-run trend of something around zero, something like that. So a lot of forecasts would call for core PCE to go back up to 4 percent by the middle of the year, for example. So that’s really where the sustainable level is. It’s more like at 4 percent. So that would suggest there’s work left to do. You know, let’s say inflation does come down much faster than we expect, which is possible. As I mentioned, you know, obviously our policy is data dependent. We would take that into account. In terms of the non—sorry, the core nonhousing services, as I mentioned earlier, it’s a very diverse sector, six or seven sectors. And so sectors that represent 55 or 60 percent of that— financial services is a big sector that’s really not driven by labor markets—wages. So that’s why I said there are a number of things that will affect—take restaurants, right? So, clearly, labor is important for restaurants but so are food prices. And, you know, transportation services is going to be driven by fuel prices, for example. So there are lots of things in that mix that will drive inflation. I would say overall, though, my own view would be that you’re not going to have, you know, a sustainable return to 2 percent inflation in that sector without a better balance in the labor market. And I don’t know what that will require in terms of increased unemployment, your question. I do think there are a number of dimensions through which the labor market can soften. And so far, we’ve got—as I mentioned, in goods, we have inflation moving down without the softening in the labor market. I think most forecasters would say that unemployment will probably rise a bit from here. But I still think—I continue to think that there’s a path to getting inflation back down to 2 percent without a really significant economic decline or a significant increase in unemployment. And that’s because the—you know, the setting we’re in is quite different. The inflation that we originally got was very much a collision between very strong demand and hard supply constraints, not something that you really have seen in prior— you know, in prior business cycles. And so now we see goods inflation coming down for the reasons we thought, and we understand why housing inflation will come down. And I think will—a story will emerge on the nonhousing services sector soon enough. But I think there is— there’s ongoing disinflation, and we don’t yet see weakening in the labor market. So we’ll have to see.","Q&A","Press Conf","","498","2023-02"
"2023-02-01","So I do think you—most forecasts and, you know, my own assessment would be that that growth will continue—positive growth will continue but at a subdued pace as it did last year. We had growth of—GDP growth of 1 percent last year and also final sales growth, which we think is a better indicator, of about 1 percent. I think, you know, most forecasts and certainly my assessment would be that growth will continue at a fairly subdued level this year. There are other factors, though, that need to be considered. You will come down, sentiment will improve. You also—state and local governments are really flush these days with, you know, money, and many of them are considering tax cuts or even sending checks. So I think that’s going to support—they’re also spending a lot. There’s a lot of spending coming in the construction pipeline, both private and public. And so that’s going to support economic activity. So I think there’s a good chance that those factors will help support positive growth this year. And that’s my base case, is that there will be positive growth this year.","Q&A","Press Conf","","188","2023-02"
"2023-02-01","So I don’t think there’s, you know, going to be a light switch flipped or anything like that. I think it’s just an accumulating—accumulation of evidence. So, of course, we’ll be looking—by the time of the March meeting, we’ll have two more employment reports, two more CPI reports, and we’ll be looking at those carefully as all of us will. And we’ll be asking ourselves, what are they telling us? And soon after that, we’ll have another ECI wage constructive. It’s—you know, it shows wages coming down but still at a high level. They’re still at a level that’s way above—well above where they were before the pandemic. So I don’t want to put a number on it in terms of months, but as the accumulated evidence comes in, it’s going to be reflected in our assessment of the outlook, and that will be reflected in our policy over time. But I will say, though, we—you know, it is our job to restore price stability and achieve 2 percent inflation for the benefit of the American public. We’re not—market participants have a very different job. It’s a fine job. It’s a great job. In fact, I did that job for years but in one form or another. But, you know, we have to deliver that. And so we are strongly resolved that we will, you know, complete this task because we think it has benefits that will, you know, support economic activity and benefit the public for many, many years.","Q&A","Press Conf","","250","2023-02"
"2023-02-01","I don’t think we know, honestly. You know, the—so we, of course, expected goods inflation to start coming down by the end of 2021, and it didn’t come down all through ’22. And now it’s coming down, and it’s come down pretty fast. So I would say these are—this is not a standard business cycle where you can look at the last 10 times there was a just harder to forecast inflation. It may come down faster. It may take longer to come down. And, you know, our job is to deliver inflation back to target, and we will do that. But I think we’re going to be cautious about declaring victory and, you know, sending signals that we think that the game is won because, you know, it’s—we’ve got a long way to go. It’s just—it’s the early stages of disinflation. And it’s most welcome to be able to say that we are now in disinflation, but that’s great. But we just see that it has to spread through the economy and that it’s going to take some time. That’s all.","Q&A","Press Conf","","182","2023-02"
"2023-02-01","You know, so—again, my forecast and that of my colleagues as you will see from the SEP and—I mean, there are many different forecasts, but, generally, it’s a forecast of slower growth, some softening in labor market conditions, and inflation moving down steadily but not quickly. And, in that case, if the economy performs broadly in line with those expectations, it will not be appropriate to cut rates this year, to loosen policy this year. Of course, other people have forecasts with inflation coming down much faster, that’s a different thing. You know, if that happens—inflation comes down much faster, you know, then we’ll be seeing that, and it will be incorporated into our thinking about policy.","Q&A","Press Conf","","117","2023-02"
"2023-02-01","I’m not particularly concerned about the divergence, no, because it is largely due to the market’s expectation that inflation will move down more quickly. I think that’s the bigger part of that. So, again, as I just mentioned, we—you know, our forecasts— different participants have different forecasts, but, generally, those forecasts are for continued subdued growth, some softening in the labor market but not a recession, not a recession. And we have inflation moving down, you know, into the—somewhere in the mid-threes or maybe lower than that this year. We’ll update that in March, but that’s what we thought in December. Markets are past that. They show inflation coming down, in some cases, much quicker than that. So we’ll just have to see. And we have a different view and—a different view, it’s a different forecast, really. And given our outlook, I just—I don’t see us cutting rates this year if we get—if our outlook turns true, as I mentioned just now. If we do see inflation coming down much more quickly, that’ll play into our policy setting, of course.","Q&A","Press Conf","","180","2023-02"
"2023-02-01","That’s the general sense of it. Look, we understand—I personally understand well that COVID is still out there, but that it’s no longer playing an important role in our economy. And, you know, we’ve kept that statement in there for quite a while, and I think we just—we knew we would take it out at some point. There’s never a perfect time, but we know, postmeeting statement as an ongoing economic risk as opposed to, you know, a health issue.","Q&A","Press Conf","","80","2023-02"
"2023-02-01","I do. Yeah, I do. You don’t see that yet. But the whole point is, you know, if you—once you see it, you have a serious problem. That means that, effectively, in people’s decisionmaking, inflation has become a really salient issue. And once that happens— that’s what we can’t allow to happen. And, you know, so that’s why we worry that the longer we’re at this and the longer people are talking about inflation all day long, every day, you know, the more risk of something like that. But no, there’s not much—it’s more of a risk. It always has been more of a risk than anything else. By the way, I think it’s becoming less salient. And people are—you know, we pick that up in conversations. And I’ve seen some data, too, that show people are, you know, gradually—they’re glad that inflation is coming down. People really don’t like inflation. And as we see it coming down, that could also add a boost to economic activity. You look at the sentiment surveys now, and they’re very, very low with 3½ percent unemployment and, you know, high wage increases nominally by historical standards. Why can that be? It has to be inflation, right? So I think once inflation is seen to be coming down in coming months, even you will also see a boost to sentiment, I hope.","Q&A","Press Conf","","228","2023-02"
"2023-02-01","That’s at the very heart, is consumers and businesses that, you know, are the—essentially, we believe that expectations of future inflation are a very important part of the process of creating inflation. That’s a sort of bedrock belief. In one way or another, it has to be. We think it’s important. And, in this case, I would say, the risk eight months ago or so, longer-term inflation expectations had moved up. We moved quite vigorously last year. Expectations are—seem to be well anchored, including at the shorter end now, not just the longer end. So it’s, you know—and that’s—I think that’s very reassuring. I think, you know, the markets have decided, and the public has decided, that inflation is going to come back down to 2 percent and it’s just a matter of us following through. That's immeasurably helpful to the process of getting inflation down. The fact that people now do generally believe that it will come down, that’ll be part of the process of getting it down. And it’s a very positive thing.","Q&A","Press Conf","","175","2023-02"
"2023-02-01","Okay. So I feel like I have to say this. There’s only one way forward here, and that is for Congress to raise the debt ceiling so that the United States government can pay all of its obligations when due. And any deviations from that path would be highly risky and that no one should assume that the Fed can protect the economy from the consequences of failing to act in a timely manner.

I mean, I’m not going to try to persuade people to have a different forecast, but our forecast is that it will take some time and some patience and that we’ll need to keep rates higher for longer.

So I think a lot of options are available. And I mean, you saw what the Bank of Canada did and, you know, they left it that they’re willing to raise rates after pausing.

"2023-03-22","So, you know, we’re well aware of the concentrations people have in commercial real estate. I really don’t think it’s comparable to this.

"2023-03-22","It’s going to depend. Remember, we’re looking—for purposes of our monetary policy tool, we’re looking at what’s happening among the banks and asking, is there going to be some tightening in credit conditions? And then we’re thinking about that as effectively doing the same thing that rate hikes do. So, in a way, that substitutes for rate hikes. So, the key is, we have to have—policy has got to be tight enough to bring inflation down to 2 percent over time. It doesn’t all have to come from rate hikes: It can come from, you know, from tighter credit conditions. So we’re looking at, and we, we—it’s highly uncertain how long the situation will be sustained or how significant any of those effects would be, so we’re just going to have to watch.

"2023-03-22","These are not weaknesses that are—that are at all broadly through the banking system. This was—this was a bank that was an outlier in terms of both its percentage of, of uninsured deposits and in terms of its holdings of duration risk. And again, supervisors did get in there, and, and they were, as you know, obviously, you know they were— they were on this issue, but nonetheless, this, this still happened. And so that’s really the nature of the interview—sorry, of the review—is to discover that.","Q&A","Press Conf","","87","2023-03"
"2023-03-22","So let me say what, what I think happened, and then I’ll come to the questions around supervision. So, at a basic level, Silicon Valley Bank management failed badly—they grew the bank very quickly, they exposed the bank to significant liquidity risk and interest rate risk, didn’t hedge that risk. We now know that supervisors saw these risks and, and intervened. We know that the public saw all this. We know that SVB experienced an unprecedentedly rapid and massive bank run. So this is a—this is a very large group of connected depositors—concentrated group of connected depositors in a very, very fast run, faster than historical record would suggest. So as for us—so for our part, we’re doing a review of supervision and regulation. My only interest is that we identify what went wrong here. How did this happen is the question. What went wrong? Try to find that. We will find that. And then make an assessment of what are the right policies to put in place so that it doesn’t happen again, and then implement those policies. It would be inappropriate for me at this stage to offer my views on what the answers might be. You know, I simply can’t do that. Vice Chair Barr is clear—really to your last question—it’s clear that we do need to strengthen supervision and regulation. And I, I assume that there will be recommendations coming out of the report, and I, I plan on supporting them and supporting their implementation.","Q&A","Press Conf","","249","2023-03"
"2023-03-22","So it’s really just a question of not knowing at this point. There’s a great deal of literature on the connection between tighter credit conditions, economic activity, hiring, and inflation. Very large body of literature. The question is, how significant will this credit tightening be and how sustainable it will be? That’s, that’s the issue. And we don’t really see it yet, so, so people are making estimates, you know, people are publishing estimates, but it’s very kind of rule-of-thumb guesswork almost at this point.

"2023-03-22","You know, we know that we have other, other tools in effect, but no, we think our monetary policy tool works, and we think, you know, many, many banks—our rate hikes were well telegraphed to the market, and many banks have managed to handle them.","Q&A","Press Conf","","45","2023-03"
"2023-03-22","So, you know, we have just come from an FOMC meeting and, you know, the people who write the minutes will be very carefully counting, but I’ll tell you what I heard. What I heard was significant number of people saying that they anticipated there would turn out not to be the case, in principle you would need more rate hikes. So some people did reflect that in their FOMC—in their SEP forecasts. I think there may also just have been— remember, this is 12 days ago. You know, we’re trying to assess something that just is so recent and it’s people—you know, it’s very difficult, there’s so much uncertainty. So December was a good place to start, and we wound up with—we wound up with very similar outcomes for December. And, you know, in a way, the early—the data in the first part—the first five weeks of the intermeeting period pointed to stronger inflation and stronger labor markets. So that pointed to higher rates. And then this, this latter part kind of—the possibility of credit conditions tightening really, really offset that, effectively.","Q&A","Press Conf","","183","2023-03"
"2023-03-22","No. I mean, with our monetary policy, we’re, we’re really focused on macroeconomic outcomes. In particular, we’re focused on, on this potential credit tightening and what can that produce in the way of tighter credit conditions. I think when we think about the situation with the banks, we’re focused on our—on our financial stability tools, in particular our lending facilities, the debt—sorry, the discount window, and also the new facility.","Q&A","Press Conf","","70","2023-03"
"2023-03-22","No, I think it’s, it’s meant to refer to our policy rate. Really, I would focus on, on the words “may” and “some,” as opposed to “ongoing.” Ongoing. So we, we clearly were—what we were doing there was taking onboard the—trying to reflect the uncertainty about what will happen. I mean, it, it’s possible that this will turn out to have very might look different. It’s also possible that this potential tightening will contribute significant tightening in credit conditions over time and, in principle, if that—that means that monetary policy may have less work to do. We simply don’t know. So.","Q&A","Press Conf","","101","2023-03"
"2023-03-22","So we considered—we did consider that in the days running up to the meeting, and you see the decision that we made, which I’ll say a couple things about. First, it was supported by a very strong consensus, and I’ll be happy to explain why. And, really, it is that the intermeeting data on inflation and the labor market came in stronger than expected and, really, before the recent events, we were clearly on track to continue with ongoing rate hikes. In fact, as of a couple of weeks ago, it looked like we’d need to raise rates over the course of the that the public has confidence that we will do so—that we’ll bring inflation down to 2 percent over time. It is important that we sustain that confidence with our actions as well as our words. So we also assess, as I mentioned, that the events of the last two weeks are likely to result in some tightening credit conditions for households and businesses and thereby weigh on demand, on the labor market, and on inflation. Such a tightening in financial conditions would work in the same direction as rate tightening. In principle, as a matter of fact, you can think of it as being the equivalent of a rate hike or perhaps more than that; of course, it’s not possible to make that assessment today with any precision whatsoever. So our decision was to move ahead with the 25 basis point hike and to change our guidance, as I mentioned, from ongoing hikes to some, some additional hikes maybe—some policy firming may be appropriate. So going forward, as I mentioned, in assessing the need for, for further hikes, we’ll be focused as always on the incoming data and the evolving outlook and, in particular, on our assessment of the actual and expected effects of credit tightening.","Q&A","Press Conf","","309","2023-03"
"2023-03-22","Thanks. So I, I guess our view is that the banking system is sound and it’s resilient—it’s got strong capital [and] liquidity. We took powerful actions with [the] Treasury and the FDIC, which demonstrate that all depositors’ savings are safe and that the banking system is safe. Deposit flows in the banking system have stabilized over the last week. And the last thing I’ll say is that we’ve undertaken—we’re undertaking a thorough internal review that will identify where we can strengthen supervision and regulation.","Q&A","Press Conf","","84","2023-03"
"2023-03-22","Good afternoon. Before discussing today’s meeting, let me briefly address recent developments in the banking sector. In the past two weeks, serious difficulties at a small number of banks have emerged. History has shown that isolated banking problems, if left unaddressed, can undermine confidence in healthy banks and threaten the ability of the banking system as a whole to play its vital role in supporting the savings and credit needs of households and businesses.

We’ll find ourselves at that place.","Q&A","Press Conf","","109","2023-03"

"2023-03-22","I mean, to be honest, I don’t—I don’t recall the specifics of that. It’s been quite an interesting seven weeks. But, but I will tell you, though, that we have—there have been presentations about, about interest rate risk. I mean, it’s been in all the newspapers. It’s not a surprise that there are institutions that have—that have had unhedged long positions in long- duration securities that have lost value as, as longer-term rates have gone up due to our rate increases. So that’s, that’s not a surprise. I, I think, as you know, as is now in the public record, the supervisory team was apparently engaged, very much engaged with the bank repeatedly, and was escalating but, you know, nonetheless, what happened happened. And so that’s really the purpose of—one way to think about the review that Vice Chair Barr is conducting is to try to understand how that happened and try to understand how we can do better and what policies we need to change. I mean, one thing is the speed of the—I’ll come back to that, the speed of the run, it’s very different from what we’ve seen in the past, and it does kind of suggest that there’s a need for possible, you know, regulatory and supervisory changes just because supervision and regulation need to keep up with what’s, what’s happening in the world.","Q&A","Press Conf","","228","2023-03"
"2023-03-22","So financial conditions seem to have tightened—and probably by more than the traditional indexes say, because traditional indexes are focused a lot on [interest] rates and [prices of] equities, and they don’t necessarily capture lending conditions. So we think that, though. So there are other measures which, if they’re focused on, you know—bank lending conditions and things like that—they show some more tightening. The question for us, though, is, how significant will that be and how, you know—what will be the extent of it and what will be the duration of it? And then—and then, you know, once you have—once you know that, there’s a fair amount of research about how that, with broad uncertainty bands—how that works its way into the economy [and] over what period of time. And so, you know, we’ll be looking to see the first part of that—like how serious is this, and does it look like it’s going to be sustained, and if it is, you know, it could easily have a significant macroeconomic effect, and we would factor that into our policy decisions.

That’s all I want. It’s—For me to be giving you my half-formed, or partially informed, thoughts, it, you know, just isn’t appropriate. There’s a real serious review going on with, with people from all over the Federal Reserve System who are not connected to this, you know, to this work, not connected to this bank, and under, again, Vice Chair Barr’s leadership, and I’m confident that it will produce a satisfactory result.","Q&A","Press Conf","","123","2023-03"
"2023-03-22","That is a great question and is right in the heart of what the review will be doing under Vice Chair Barr’s leadership. So that’s, I think that’s where—that’s what you think about.

"2023-03-22","You know it’s, it’s too early to say, really, whether these events have had much of an effect. It’s hard for me to see how they would have helped the possibility—but I guess I would just say, it’s too early to say whether there really have been changes in that. You know, the question will be how long this period is sustained. The longer it’s sustained, then the greater will be the likely declines in—or tightening in credit standards, credit availability, so we’ll just have to see. I do still think, though, that there’s a—there’s a pathway to that. I think that pathway still exists and, you know, we’re certainly trying to find it.","Q&A","Press Conf","","114","2023-03"
"2023-03-22","So—People think of QE and QT in different ways, so let me be clear about how I’m thinking about these recent developments. So the recent liquidity provision that has increased the size of our balance sheet but the intent and the effects of it are very different from what we—from when we expand our balance sheet through purchases of longer-term securities. Large-scale purchases of long-term securities are, are really meant to alter the stance of policy by pushing down—pushing up the price and down the rates, longer-term rates, which supports demand through channels we understand fairly well. The balance sheet expansion is really temporary lending to banks to meet those special liquidity demands created by the recent tensions; it’s not intended to directly alter the stance of monetary policy. We do believe that it’s working. It’s having its intended effect of bolstering confidence in the banking system and thereby forestalling what might otherwise have been an abrupt and outsized tightening in financial conditions. So that’s working. In terms of the distribution of reserves, we, we don’t see ourselves as, as running into reserve shortages. We, we think that our program of allowing our balance sheet to, to run off predictably, predicatbly and passively is working. And of course we’re, we’re always prepared to, to change that if that changes. But we don’t see any evidence that that’s changed.","Q&A","Press Conf","","228","2023-03"
"2023-03-22","So that’s just—that’s an estimate of what will happen as demand slows and as conditions soften in the labor market and it’s just—it’s a highly uncertain estimate. And, I mean, I was really—we have to bring inflation down to 2 percent. The costs of bringing it down—there are real costs to bringing it down to 2 percent, but the costs of failing are much higher. And if you read your history, as I’m sure you have, you can see that if the central bank doesn’t get inflation back in place, get inflation—make sure that inflation expectations remain anchored, you can have a long series of years where inflation is high and volatile, and it’s hard to invest capital, it’s hard for an economy to perform well. And we’re looking to avoid that and, you know, to get back to where we need to be—back to where we were for a quarter century, and get there as quickly as we can.","Q&A","Press Conf","","160","2023-03"
"2023-03-22","Sure. So, you know, we—that was really the Swiss government that we of course were, were following it over the course of the weekend, and we were engaged with their authorities in the way that you would expect, all the ways that you would expect. It seems to have been a positive outcome in the sense that the transaction was agreed to, and it has been— the markets have accepted it, and it seems to have gone well, and I think there was a concern that it might not go well. So coming into the middle of this week, yes, I would say that that is going well so far.","Q&A","Press Conf","","110","2023-03"

"2023-03-22","Well, it depends on whether you—so recessions tend to be nonlinear, and so they’re very hard to model. You know, the models all work in a kind of linear way—if you have more of this, you get more of that. But when a recession happens, the reactions tend to be nonlinear and that’s what—so we don’t know whether that’ll happen this time. We don’t know—if so, we don’t know how significant it will be, and so, you know, we’re very focused on getting inflation down because we know in the longer run that that is the thing that will most benefit the people we serve. That’s how we can have a long—you know, we’ve had very strong the reason was inflation wasn’t forcing the central bank to come in and stop an incipient or, or, you know, an expansion. You can have very, very long expansions without high inflation, and we had several of those, and they’re very good for people. You see late in an expansion—you see low unemployment, you see the benefits of wages going to people at the lower end of the wage spectrum. It’s just a place that we should try to get back to.","Q&A","Press Conf","","199","2023-03"

I, I think it’s enabled us to see more data, and it will continue to do maybe slowing down economic activity too much. And we thought that this rate hike, along with the meaningful change in, in our policy statement, was the right way to balance that.","Q&A","Press Conf","","110","2023-05"
"2023-05-03","Good afternoon. Before discussing today’s meeting, let me comment briefly on recent developments in the banking sector. Conditions in that sector have broadly improved since early March, and the U.S banking system is sound and resilient. We will continue to monitor conditions in the sector. We are committed to learning the right lessons from this episode and will work to prevent events like these from happening again. As a first step in that process, last week we released Vice Chair for Supervision Barr’s Review of the Federal Reserve’s Supervision and Regulation of Silicon Valley Bank. The review’s findings underscore the need to address our rules and supervisory practices to make for a stronger and more resilient banking system, and I am confident that we will do so. From the perspective of monetary policy, our focus remains squarely on our dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people. My colleagues and I understand the hardship that high inflation is causing, and we remain strongly committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal. Price stability is the responsibility of the Federal Reserve. Without price stability, the economy does not work for anyone. In particular, without price stability, we will not achieve a sustained period of strong labor market conditions that benefit all. Today, the FOMC raised its policy interest rate by ¼ percentage point. Since early last year, we have raised interest rates by a total of 5 percentage points in order to attain a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2 percent over time. We are also continuing to reduce our securities holdings. Looking ahead, we will take a data-dependent approach in determining the extent to which additional policy firming may be appropriate. I will The","Opening Statement","Press Conf","","299","2023-05"
"2023-05-03","So, taking your question—of course, today our decision was to raise the federal funds rate by 25 basis points. A, a decision on a pause was not made today. You will have noticed that in the—in the statement from March, we had a sentence that said the Committee anticipates that some additional policy firming may be appropriate. That sentence is, is not in, in the statement anymore. We took that out, and instead we’re saying that, in that’s a meaningful change that we’re no longer saying that we anticipate. And so we’ll be driven by incoming data meeting by meeting. And, you know, we’ll approach that question at the June meeting. So the—the staff’s forecast is—so let me say—start by saying that that’s not my own most likely case, which is really that, that the economy will continue to grow at, at a modest rate this year. And I think that’s—so different people on the Committee have different forecasts. That’s, that’s my own assessment of the most likely path. [The] staff produces its own forecast, and it’s independent of the forecasts of, of the participants, which include the Governors and the Reserve Bank presidents, of course. And we think this is a healthy thing— that the, the staff is writing down what they really think. They’re not especially influenced by what the Governors think, and vice versa. The Governors are not taking what the staff says and just writing that down. So it’s actually good that the, the staff and individual participants can have different perspectives. So, broadly, the forecast was for a mild recession, and by that I would characterize as one in which the rise in unemployment is smaller than is—has been typical in modern-era recessions. I wouldn’t want to characterize the staff’s forecast for this meeting. We’ll, we’ll leave that to the minutes—but broadly, broadly similar to that.","Q&A","Press Conf","","311","2023-05"
"2023-05-03","I wouldn’t say that it did. It was—of course, it’s something that came up. We talk a lot about risks to the—to the outlook, and that will—that come up. A number of people did raise that as a risk to the outlook. I wouldn’t say that it was important in today’s monetary policy decision.","Q&A","Press Conf","","54","2023-05"
"2023-05-03","Sure. So the February 14 presentation—I didn’t remember it very well. But now, of course, I’ve gone back and looked at it very carefully. I did remember it. And what it was was a general presentation. It was an informational briefing of the whole Board— the entire Board. I think all members were there. And it was about interest rate risk in the banks and, and lots of data. And there was one page on Silicon Valley Bank, which talked about, you know, the amount of losses they—or mark-to-market losses they had in their portfolio. There was nothing in it about—that I recall, anyway, about, about the risk of a bank run. So it was—I think the takeaway was, they were going away to do a—an assessment, a vertical—sorry, horizontal assessment of, of banks. It wasn’t—it, it wasn’t presented as an urgent or alarming situation. It was presented as a—as an informational, nondecisional kind of a thing. And I thought it was a good presentation and, and, as I said, did remember it. In terms of what we’re doing—of course, I think banks themselves are, are—many, many banks are now, are attending to liquidity and taking opportunity now, really, since, since the events of, of early March, to build liquidity. And you asked about the separation principle. I— you know, like so many things, it, it’s very useful. But, you know, ultimately, it has its limits. I mean, I, I think in this particular case, we have found that the monetary policy tools and the financial stability tools are not in conflict. They’re both—they’re working well together. We’ve used our, our financial stability tools to support banks through our lending facilities. And, at the","Q&A","Press Conf","","284","2023-05"
"2023-05-03","Well, I mean, I didn’t say it wasn’t alarming. It was—they’re pointing out something that they’re working on and that they’re on the case—that, that, you know, that—I’m not sure whether they mentioned—I think they did, actually. They mentioned that they had taken regulatory action matter—or supervisory action in the form of matters requiring attention. So I think that was also in the presentation. I think it was to say: Yes, this is a bank, and there are many other banks that are experiencing this—these things, and we’re on the case.","Q&A","Press Conf","","91","2023-05"
"2023-05-03","So I, you know, we certainly don’t—and I don’t have an agenda to further consolidate banks. There’s been—consolidation has been a factor in the","Q&A","Press Conf","","24","2023-05"
"2023-05-03","So I, I think it’s probably good policy that we, we don’t want the largest banks doing big acquisitions. That is the policy. And—but this is—this is an exception for a failing bank. And I, I think it’s actually a good outcome for the banking system. It also would have—would have been a good—a good outcome for the banking system had one of the regional banks bought, bought this company. And that could have been the outcome. But, ultimately, we have to follow the law in our agencies, and the law is, it goes to the, the least-cost bid.","Q&A","Press Conf","","99","2023-05"
"2023-05-03","Yeah. I think—I think I follow that up by saying, it’s, it’s quite impossible to have a precise estimate of the words to that effect. But, in principle, that’s the idea. You know, when we—we’ve been raising interest rates, and that raises the price of credit, and that, in a sense, restricts credit in the economy, working through the price mechanism. And, you know, when banks raise their credit standards, that can also make credit tighter in a kind of broadly similar way. It isn’t—it isn’t possible to make a kind of clean translation between one and the other, although firms are trying that and, you know, we’re trying it. But, ultimately, we have to be—we have to be honest and humble about our ability to make a precise assessment. So it does complicate the task of achieving, you know, a sufficiently restrictive stance. But I think, conceptually, though, we think that, you know, interest rates—in principle, we won’t have to raise the rates quite as high as we would have had this not happened. The extent of that is so hard to predict because we don’t know how persistent these, these effects will be. We don’t know how large they’ll be and how long they’ll take to be transmitted. But that’s, that’s what we’ll be watching carefully to find out.","Q&A","Press Conf","","221","2023-05"
"2023-05-03","It’s that—this is just something that we have to factor in as we—as we want to find ourselves. So I guess I would say it this way: The assessment of, of the extent to which additional policy firming may be appropriate is going to be an ongoing one, meeting by meeting, and we’re going to be looking at the factors that I mentioned that—they’re listed in, in understanding of monetary policy. Credit tightening is a different thing. There’s a lot of literature on that. But translating it into, into rate hikes is uncertain, let’s say—it adds even further uncertainty. Nonetheless, we’ll be able to see what’s happening with credit conditions— what’s happening with lending. We get—there’s a lot of data on that. And, you know, we’ll, we’ll factor that into our decisionmaking.","Q&A","Press Conf","","132","2023-05"
"2023-05-03","That’s going to be an ongoing assessment. We’re going to need data to accumulate on that—not an assessment that we’ve made, as—that, that would mean we think we’ve reached that point. And I just think it’s, it’s not possible to say that with confidence now. But, nonetheless, you, you will know that the Summary of Economic Projections from the March meeting showed that in—at that point in time, that the median participant thought that this was— this was the appropriate level of the—of the ultimate high level of rates. We don’t know that. We’ll revisit that at the June meeting. And that’s—you know, we’re just going to have to— before we really declare that, I think we’re going to have to see data accumulating and, and, you know, make that—as I mentioned, it’s an ongoing assessment.","Q&A","Press Conf","","136","2023-05"
"2023-05-03","So we’re going to release the results of this SLOOS on May 8, in line with our usual time frame. And I would just say that the SLOOS is broadly consistent, when you see it, with how we and others have been thinking about the situation and what we’re seeing from other sources. You will have seen the Beige Book and listened to the various earnings calls that indicate that midsize banks have—some of them had been tightening their lending standards. Banking data will show that lending has continued to grow, but the pace has been slowing really since the second half of last year.","Q&A","Press Conf","","105","2023-05"
"2023-05-03","Yeah. I mean, as I mentioned, I would just say that this assessment will be an ongoing one. You—you know, you can’t—with, with economic data, you, you can’t—you’ve, you’ve seen—take inflation for a minute. Look, look back. We’ve seen inflation come down—move back up two or three times since March of 2021. We’ve seen inflation have a few months of coming down and then come right back up. So I think you’re going to want to see that—you know, that a few months of data will, will persuade you that you’ve—that you’ve got this right, kind of thing. And, you know, we, we have the luxury: We’ve raised 500 basis points. I think that policy is tight. I think real rates are probably—that you can calculate them many different ways. But one way is to look at the nominal rate and then subtract a, a reasonable estimate of, of, let’s say, one-year inflation, which might be 3 percent. So you’ve got 2 percent real rates. That’s meaningfully above what most people would—many people, anyway, would, would assess as, you know, the neutral rate. So policy is tight. And you see that in interest— interest-sensitive activities. And you also begin to see it more and more in, in other activities. And if you—if you put the—you put the credit tightening on top of that and the QT that’s, that’s","Q&A","Press Conf","","228","2023-05"

"2023-05-03","You know, it’s—let me just say, that’s not what we’re looking for. We’re looking for inflation going down to 2 percent over time. I mean, we—that’s, that’s not a question that’s in front of us, and it would depend on so many other things. But, ultimately, we’re not looking to get to 3 percent and then drop our tools. We have a, a goal of getting to 2 percent. We think it’s going to take some time. We don’t think it’ll be a smooth process. And, you know, I think we’re going to—we’re going to need to stay at this for a while.","Q&A","Press Conf","","103","2023-05"
"2023-05-03","I think they, they—you know, they, they will both matter equally at that point. Right now, you have a labor market that’s still extraordinarily tight. You still got 1.6 job openings, even with the lower job openings number, for every unemployed person. We do see some evidence of softening in labor market conditions. But, overall, you’re near a 50-year low in unemployment. Wages—you all will have seen that the wage number from late see some softening; we see new labor supply coming in. These are very positive developments. But the labor market is very, very strong, whereas inflation is, you know, running high—well above our—well above our goal. And right now, we need to be focusing on bringing inflation down. Fortunately, we’ve been able to do that so far without unemployment going up.","Q&A","Press Conf","","133","2023-05"
"2023-05-03","Yeah. I would just say, it’s —I, I don’t really think we should be— we shouldn’t even be talking about a world in which the","Q&A","Press Conf","","25","2023-05"
"2023-05-03","Sure. So we look at a range of wage, wage measures. And then that’s in nominal. And then—so you assume wages should be equal to productivity increases plus inflation. And so you can—you can look at, you know, the employment compensation index, average hourly earnings, the Atlanta wage tracker, compensation per hour—basically, those four and many others. And you can—you can look at, at what the—what they would have to run at over a long period of time for that to be consistent with 2 percent inflation. They can recession—sorry, later in an expansion. So, yeah. The, the—you know, and we calculate those, and you have to take the precision with a degree of—a degree of salt. But I would say that what they will show is that, you know, if, if the—if wages are running at 5 percent, 3 percent is closer to where they need to be. Wage increases and closer to 3 percent, roughly, is what it would take to get—to be consistent with inflation over a longer period of time. I—by the way, I don’t want to—I do not think that wages are the principal driver of inflation. You’re asking me a very specific question. I think there are many things. I think wages and prices tend to move together. And it’s very hard to say what’s causing what. But, you know, I’ve never said that, you know, that—that wages are really the principal driver, because I don’t think that’s really right.","Q&A","Press Conf","","246","2023-05"
"2023-05-03","So higher profits and higher margins are what happens when you have an imbalance between supply and demand: too much demand, not enough supply. And we’ve been in a situation in many parts of the economy where, where supply has been fixed or, or not flexible enough. And so, you know, the way the market clears is through higher prices. So to get, I, I think—as goods pipelines have, have gotten, you know, back to normal so that we full competition, where there’s enough supply to meet demand. And then it’s—then it’s, then you’re really back to full competition. That’s—that would be the dynamic I would expect.","Q&A","Press Conf","","107","2023-05"
"2023-05-03","I didn’t catch the last part. Rolling?","Q&A","Press Conf","","7","2023-05"
"2023-05-03","Oh, yes. Sorry, sorry, sorry. Okay, I got it. So, what are we looking at? I mean, we look at a combination of data and, and forecasts. Of course, the whole idea is to—is to create a good forecast based on what you see in the data. So we’re always, always looking at both. You know, and it will—of course, it’ll be the obvious things. It’ll be readings on inflation. It’ll be readings on wages, on economic growth, on the labor market, and all of those many things. I think a particular focus for us going—now, over the past six, seven weeks now and going forward is going to be, what’s happening with credit tightening? Are small and medium-sized banks tightening credit standards, and, and is that having an effect on, on loans, on lending? And, you know, so we can begin to assess how that fits in with monetary policy. That’ll, that’ll be an important thing. I just—you know, we’ll be looking at everything. It’s— perhaps a little bit more, due to what’s happened. And we have to factor all of that in and, and make our assessment of—you know, of whether our policy stance is sufficiently restrictive. And we have to do that in a world where policy works with long and variable lags. So this is challenging. But, you know, we, we will make our best assessment, and that’s what we think.","Q&A","Press Conf","","235","2023-05"
"2023-05-03","Yeah. So we on the Committee have a—have a view that inflation is going to come down—not so quickly, but it’ll take some time. And in that world, if that forecast is broadly right, it would not be appropriate and—to cut rates, and we won’t cut rates. If you have a different forecast and, you know, markets—or have been, from time to time, pricing in, you know, quite rapid reductions in inflation, you know, we’d, we’d factor that in. But that’s not our forecast. And, of course, the history of the last two years has been very much that inflation moves down. Particularly now, if you look at nonhousing services, it really, really hasn’t moved much. And it’s quite stable. And, you know, so we think we’ll have to—demand will have to weaken a little bit, and labor market conditions, conditions may have to soften a bit more to begin to see progress there. And, again, in that world, it wouldn’t be—it wouldn’t be appropriate for us to cut rates.","Q&A","Press Conf","","170","2023-05"
"2023-05-03","Sure. So we looked at that very carefully, as you would imagine. And, you know, the—it’s, it’s really not contributing, we don’t think, now. It hasn’t actually been growing. You know, it moved up—moved down and then moved back up to where it was. What happened in the—when, when there were the big deposit flows, which, by the way, have really stabilized now—what happened was, institutional investors took their uninsured deposits and put them in government money market funds, which bought paper from the Federal Home Loan Banks and things like that. Over the course of, of maybe the last year, retail investors had been gradual—as they do in every tightening cycle, they’ve been gradually moving their deposits into higher-yielding places such as CDs and, and other things, including money market funds. So that’s a gradual process that is quite natural and happens during a, a tightening cycle. What was unusual, really, was the institutional investors moving their uninsured deposits and spreading them around and things like that. But it doesn’t seem to have had any—any effect overall on the overnight repo facility. That is really there to, to help us keep rates where they’re supposed to be, and it’s, it’s serving that purpose very well.","Q&A","Press Conf","","206","2023-05"
"2023-05-03","Yeah. I don’t think—you know, I know what’s printed in the Summary of Economic Projections and all that. I don’t think you can deduce exactly what you said about what participants think, because you don’t know what they were thinking for first- quarter GDP at that point. They could have been thinking about a fairly low number. Anyway, in any case, I’ll just say, I, I continue to think that it’s possible that this time is really different. And the reason is, there’s just so much excess demand, really, in the labor market. It’s, it’s interesting, as, you know, we’ve raised rates by 5 percentage points in 14 months, and the unemployment rate is 3½ percent, pretty much where it was—even lower than where it was when we started. So job openings are still very, very high. We see—by surveys and much, the—as they’ve declined without unemployment going up. Well, that’s what we’ve seen. So we—there are no promises in this. But it just seems that, to me, that it’s possible that we can continue to have a cooling in the labor market without having the big increases in unemployment that have gone with many, you know, prior episodes. Now, that would be against history. I, I fully appreciate that. That would be against the, the pattern. But I do think that it—that this, that the situation in the labor market, with so much excess demand, yet, you know, wages are actually—wages have been moving down. Wage increases have been moving down, and that’s a good sign—down to a more sustainable level. So I think that—I think it’s still possible. I—you know, I think, you know, the, the case of, of avoiding a recession is, in my view, more likely than that of having, having a recession. But it’s not—it’s not that the case of having a recession is—I don’t rule that out, either. It’s, it’s possible that we will have what I hope would be a mild recession.","Q&A","Press Conf","","329","2023-05"
"2023-05-03","So I, I didn’t—I didn’t take part in creating the report or doing the work, but I do—I have read it, of course. And I find it persuasive. I mean, I would say it this way: A, a very large—a large bank, not a very large bank—a large bank failed quite suddenly and unexpectedly in a way that threatened to spread contagion into the financial system. I think the only thing that, that I’m really focused on is to understand what went wrong, what happened, and, and identify what we need to do to address that. Some of that is—may, it may just have been technology evolving. You know, we have to keep up with all that. But some of it may be our policies, and—supervisory and regulatory, whatever. What our job is now is, identify those things and implement them. And that’s kind of the only thing I care about is—and I think—I feel like I am accountable for doing everything I can to make sure that that happens.","Q&A","Press Conf","","170","2023-05"
"2023-05-03","So I guess I would—I guess I would say it this way. There were three large banks, really, from the very beginning that were at the heart of the stress that we— that we saw in early March, the severe period of stress. Those have now all been resolved, and all the depositors have been protected. I think that the resolution and sale of, of First Republic kind of draws a line under that period of—is an important step toward drawing a line under that period of, of severe stress. Okay. I also think we are very focused on what’s happening with credit availability, particularly, you know, with what you saw in the—in the Beige Book, and you will see in the SLOOS, is, is small and medium—medium-sized, small and medium-sized banks who are feeling that they need to tighten credit standards—build liquidity. What’s going to be the macroeconomic effect of that? More broadly, we, we will continue to very carefully monitor what’s going on in the banking system, and we’ll factor that assessment into our decisions in an important way, going forward.","Q&A","Press Conf","","183","2023-05"
"2023-05-03","Sure. So let me say, first of all, I’ve been Chair of the Board for five-plus years now, and I fully recognize that we made mistakes. I think we’ve learned some recommendations. And I do feel that I’m personally accountable to do what I can to foster measures that will address the problems. So, on, on the Vice Chair for Supervision, you know, the place to start is, is the statutory role, which is quite unusual. The Vice Chair, it says, shall deploy policy recommendations—“develop policy recommendations for the Board regarding supervision and regulation of depository institution","Q&A","Press Conf","","97","2023-05"
"2023-05-03","So support for the 25 basis point rate increase was very strong across the board. I would say there are a number of people—and, you know, you’ll see this in the minutes. I don’t want to try to do the head count in real time. But people did talk about pausing, but not so much at this meeting, you know, that we’re—I mean, there’s a sense that we’re, we’re—that, you know, we’re much closer to the end of this than to the beginning, that—you know, as I mentioned, if you—if you add up all the tightening that’s going on through various channels, it’s—we, we feel like we—you know, we’re getting close or, or maybe even there. But that, again, that’s going to be an ongoing assessment. And, and we’re going to be looking at those factors that we listed and—to determine whether there’s, there’s more to do.","Q&A","Press Conf","","147","2023-05"
"2023-05-03","Well, I just would start with something that’s changed, really, which is this—the run on Silicon Valley Bank was out of keeping with the speed of runs through history. And that now needs to be reflected in some—in some way in regulation and in supervision. It—we know—now that we know it’s possible, I think we didn’t—no one thought that was possible. No one—I’m not aware of anybody thinking that this could happen so—quite so quickly. So I think that, you know, that will play through. I, I, you know—it will be up to Vice Chair Barr to really take the lead in designing the ways to address that. But I think—I think that’s one thing. I, I guess I would just say that. Then, you know—that we’re going to— obviously, we’re going to revisit [this]. It’s pretty clear we need—to me, anyways—clear that we need to strengthen both supervision and regulations for banks of this size.

"2023-06-14","Yeah. So, you know, we’ve—remember, we’ve—we’re two and a half years into this—or two and a quarter years into this. And forecasters, including Fed forecasters, have consistently thought that inflation was about to turn down and, you know, traditional—you know, typically forecasted that it would and been wrong. So I think if you—I think if you look at the—at core PCE inflation overall—look at it over the last six months—you’re just not seeing a lot of progress. It’s running, and it’s running course, we’re going to get inflation down to 2 percent over time. We, we don’t want to do—we, we want to do that with the minimum damage we can to the economy, of course. But we have to get inflation down to 2 percent, and we will. And we just don’t see that yet. So, hence, you see today’s policy decision: both, both to write down further rate hikes by the end of this year but also to, you know, to take—to, to moderate somewhat the pace with which we’re moving.","Q&A","Press Conf","","173","2023-06"

"2023-06-14","Sure. So, you know, if you look two and three years out with, with the forecast—first of all, I wouldn’t—I wouldn’t put too much weight on forecasts even one year out because they’re, they’re so highly uncertain. But what they’re showing is that as inflation comes down in the—in the forecast, if you don’t lower interest rates, then real rates are actually going up, right? So just to maintain a real rate, the nominal rate at that point—two years out, let’s say—should come down just to maintain real rates. And if—and actually, you know, since we’re, we’re probably going to—we’re, we’re having real rates that are going to have to be meaningfully positive and significantly. So for us to get inflation down, that probably means— that, that certainly means that, that it will be appropriate to cut rates at such time as inflation is do I think it is at all likely to be appropriate, if you think about it. Inflation has not really moved down. It has—it has not so far reacted much to our—to our existing rate hikes. And so we’re going have to keep at it.","Q&A","Press Conf","","189","2023-06"
"2023-06-14","So we are, of course, worried about—there are—there are long- standing differences in racial and ethnic groups across, across our labor market. That’s a factor that we don’t—we can’t really address with our tools. But we do consider that when we’re thinking about what constitutes maximum employment—it is, for us, a broad and inclusive goal. And so we do watch that. But remember, all unemployment, including Black unemployment, has been bouncing around right near historic lows—historic modern lows here. So we’re still talking about, I mean, what is as strong a labor market as we’ve seen in, you know, a half- century here in the United States. So overall unemployment of 3.7 percent is, is higher—three- tenths higher than it was measured to be at the last—a month ago. But, still, it’s extraordinarily low. And so it’s a very, very tight labor market.","Q&A","Press Conf","","143","2023-06"
"2023-06-14","I wouldn’t say—that’s, you know—as a factual matter, that’s correct.

And rental is, is a very large part of the CPI—about a third—and it’s about half of that for the","Q&A","Press Conf","","65","2023-06"
"2023-06-14","So wages will continue to increase. So we, we, you know—what we’re talking about is having wage increases still at a very strong level but at a level that’s extremely elevated—highly elevated levels a year or so ago, and they’re, they’re moving back down but, but quite gradually. And, and, you know, we want to see that, that process continue gradually. Of course, it’s great to see wage increases, particularly for people at the lower end of the income spectrum. But we want that as part of the process of getting inflation back down to 2 percent, which benefits everyone. I mean, inflation hurts those same people more than anyone else. People on a fixed income are hurt the worst, and the fastest, by high inflation.","Q&A","Press Conf","","126","2023-06"
"2023-06-14","So the topic of wages in the labor market and dynamics in the labor market could—is about as central a topic to our discussions as, as anything. I mean, it’s, it’s very—labor economics, you know, and the labor market are utterly central. You know, it’s half of our mandate. So we spend a lot of time talking about that. I think, you know, we—there, there are structural issues that are really not for the Fed. And so we don’t spend a lot of time— although we take notice of, of what’s going on, but we’re not, you know—we’re not involved in discussions or debates over, over strikes and things like that. But we—you know, we, we look, and we see what’s going on. And, you know, we’re making judgments about what it will take to get inflation down to 2 percent in the aggregate. And as I said, don’t think that was about—I the part of the economy where we have seen the least progress.","Q&A","Press Conf","","165","2023-06"
"2023-06-14","So I’m trying to think where to start. I’ll start with commercial real estate. We—of course, we’re watching that situation very carefully. There’s a substantial amount of commercial real estate in the banking system. A, a large part of it is in smaller banks. It’s well distributed—to the extent it’s well distributedthen, then the system could, could take losses. We do expect that there will be losses, but they’ll be—they’ll be banks that have concentrations, and those banks will experience larger losses. So we’re well aware of that. We’re monitoring it carefully. You know, it feels like—it feels like something that will be around for some time, as opposed to, you know, something that will suddenly hit and, and, you know, work its way into systemic risk. In terms of nonbank financials—financial sector—there’s been a ton of work. And, you know, clearly in the—in the pandemic, it really was—it was the nonbank financial sector where, where issues really arose. And, you know, there’s a lot of work going on in—with the Administration, in particular, leading that to try to address issues in the Treasury market and, and in all kinds of areas in the nonbank financial market. And—but, you know, our jurisdiction at You know, in terms of the events of March—as I mentioned earlier, we will be carefully monitoring that situation. You know, our, our job generally involves worrying about a lot of things that may go wrong, and that would include the banks. It might be hard for me to identify something that we don’t worry about rather than that we do worry about. So we’re watching those things very carefully. And as we see things unfold—as we see what’s happening with credit conditions and, and also all the individual banks that are out there, you know, we’ll be able to take, to the extent it’s appropriate, we can take, if they’re macroeconomic implications, we can take that into account in our rate setting. And so I guess that’s what I would say.","Q&A","Press Conf","","335","2023-06"
"2023-06-14","So that’s—and, and I was—I guess I meant to address that by saying as we—as we watch, we’ll see what’s happening. And if we—if we’re seeing the kind of tightening of conditions that, that you could be referring to, then we can factor that—because really, we’re—we use our—our rate tool is, is, you know, is—it really has macroeconomic purposes. So we’ll, we’ll take that into account. Of course, we have responsibility for financial stability as well. And that also is a factor that we’re always going to be considering.

"2023-06-14","You know, I, I would say again that I think that, over time, the balance of risks, as we move from very, you know—from interest rates that are effectively zero now to 5 percentage points with, with an SEP calling for additional hikes—I think we’ve moved much closer to our destination, which is that sufficiently restrictive rate, and I think that means by—almost by definition that the—that the risks of, of sort of overdoing it and under, there with inflation yet because we’re just looking at the data. And if you look at the—at the full range of, of inflation data, particularly the core data, you just—you just aren’t seeing a lot of progress over the last year. Headline, of course, inflation has come down materially, but, as you know, we look at core [inflation] as a better indicator of where inflation overall is going. Sufficiently—so I think, you know, what, what we’d like to see is credible evidence that inflation is topping out and then beginning to come down. That’s, that’s what we want to see— of course that’s what we want to see. And I, I think it’s—it’s also—we understand that there are lags, but remember that it’s, it’s more than a year since financial conditions began tightening. I think it’s—I think the reason we’re, we’re comfortable pausing is that we are still—much of the tightening took place over last summer and later into the year. And I think it’s, it’s reasonable to think that some of that may come into effect. So we’re, you know—I think stretching out into a more moderate pace is appropriate to, to allow you to make that judgment of sufficiency, you know, more—with more data over time.","Q&A","Press Conf","","285","2023-06"

We’ll look at all the data, the evolving outlook, and we’ll make a decision.","Q&A","Press Conf","","105","2023-06"
"2023-06-14","So the—first, I would say that the, the question of speed is a separate question from the question—from the—from, from that of level. Okay. So—and I think if you look at the SEP, that is our estimate—our individual—it’s, it’s really a cumulation of our individual estimates of how far to go. I, I mentioned how, how we got to those numbers. In terms of speed, it’s, it’s what I said at the beginning, which is, speed was very important last year. As we get closer and closer to the destination—and, according to the SEP, we’re not so far away from the destination, in most people’s accounting—it’s, it’s reasonable—it’s common sense to go a little slower, just as it was reasonable to go from 75 basis points to 50 to 25 at every meeting. And so the Committee thought overall that it was appropriate to moderate the pace, if only slightly. Then there are benefits to that. So that gives us more information to make decisions. We may try to make better decisions. I think it allows the economy a little more time to adapt as we—as we make our decisions going forward, and we’ll get to see, you know—we haven’t really—we don’t know the full extent of, of the consequences of the banking turmoil that we’ve seen. We, we—it would be early to see those, but we don’t know what the extent is. We’ll have some more time to see that unfold. I mean, it’s, it’s just the idea that we’re trying to get this right. And this is—if you think of the two things as separate variables, then I think—I think that the skip—I shouldn’t call it a skip—the, the decision makes sense.","Q&A","Press Conf","","284","2023-06"
"2023-06-14","So again, we didn’t—we didn’t make a decision about July. I mean, of course, it, it came up in the—in the meeting from time to time. But really, the focus was, was on what to do today. I would say about, about July two things: (1) [the] decision hasn’t been made, (2) I do expect that it will be a “live” meeting.","Q&A","Press Conf","","62","2023-06"
"2023-06-14","So, I guess I would—I guess I would go back to the beginning of this tightening cycle to address that. So as we started our rate hikes early last year, we said there were three issues that would need to be addressed kind of in sequence—that of the speed of tightening, the level to which rates would need to go, and then a period of time over which we’d need to keep policy restrictive. So at the outset, going back 15 months, the key issue was how fast to move rates up, and we moved very quickly by historical standards. Then last December, after four consecutive 75 basis point hikes, we moderated to a pace of 50—of a 50 basis point hike and then this year to three 25 basis point hikes at sequential meetings. So it seemed to us to make obvious sense to moderate our rate hikes as we got closer to our destination. So the decision to consider not hiking at every meeting and ultimately to hold rates steady at this meeting, I would just say it’s a continuation of, of that process. The main issue that we’re focused on now is determining the extent of additional policy firming that may be appropriate to return inflation to 2 percent over time—so that the pace of the increases and the ultimate level of increases are separate variables, given how far it—we have come. It may make sense for rates to move higher but at a more moderate pace. would happen at the next meeting, including—we did not decide or really discuss anything about going to an every-other-meeting kind of an approach or, or really any other approach. We really were focused on what to do at this meeting.","Q&A","Press Conf","","290","2023-06"
"2023-06-14","Good afternoon. My colleagues and I remain squarely focused on our dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people. We understand the hardship that high inflation is causing, and we remain strongly committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal. Price stability is the responsibility of the Federal Reserve. Without price stability, the economy doesn’t work for anyone. In particular, without price stability, we will not achieve a sustained period of strong labor market conditions that benefit all. Since early last year, the FOMC has significantly tightened the stance of monetary policy. We have raised our policy interest rate by 5 percentage points, and we’ve continued to reduce our securities holdings at a brisk pace. We’ve covered a lot of ground, and the full effects of our tightening have yet to be felt. In light of how far we’ve come in tightening policy, the uncertain lags with which monetary policy affects the economy, and potential headwinds from credit tightening, today we decided to leave our policy interest rate unchanged and to continue to reduce our securities holdings. Looking ahead, nearly all Committee participants view it as likely that some further rate increases will be appropriate this year to bring inflation down to 2 percent over time. And I will have more to say about monetary policy after briefly reviewing economic developments. The","Opening Statement","Press Conf","","230","2023-06"

"2023-06-14","Right. So I’m, I’m not going to comment on any particular paper, but I, I would say that the—I think the overall picture is that at the beginning in, you know, early 2021, inflation was really becoming from very strong demand for—largely for goods. People were still at home. They had money in the bank, and they wanted to spend—they spent a lot on goods. And, of course, at the same time—and because of that high demand, to some extent, supply chains got all snarled up. So prices went way up. Inflation went way up. So that was the, the origin, and it wasn’t really particularly about the labor market or wages. But as you—as you moved into—through ’21, into ’22, and now in ’23, I think many, many analysts believe that it will be important—an important part of getting inflation down, especially in the nonhousing We actually have seen wages broadly move down but just at a quite gradual pace.

"2023-06-14","You know, I, I think if you look at—if, if you just look at—I’ll just point you to the forecast.

This is by the end of this year. So that’s expecting pretty substantial progress. That’s, that’s a pretty significant decline for half a year. So that’s, that’s the forecast. You know, we’ll—we do try to be transparent in our reaction function. We’re, we’re committed to getting inflation down. And that’s the number-one thing.

"2023-07-26","So it is—it is a very positive thing that, actually, the unemployment rate is the same as it was when we lifted off in March of ’22, at 3.6 percent. So that’s a real blessing in that we’ve been able to achieve some disinflation, and we don’t seek to it. It’s not that we’re aiming to, to raise unemployment, but I would just say, the historical record—we have to be honest about the historical record, which does suggest that when central banks go in and slow the economy to bring down inflation, the result tends to be some softening in labor market conditions. And so that is still the, the likely outcome here. And, you know, we hope that that’s as little as possible, but we have to be honest that that is—that is the likely outcome. The worst outcome for everyone, of course, would be not to deal with inflation now, not get it done. Whatever the short-term social costs of getting inflation under control, the longer- term social costs of failing to do so are greater, and the historical record is very, very clear on that. If you go through a period where inflation expectations are not anchored, inflation is volatile, it interferes with people’s lives and with economic activity, and, you know, that’s the— that’s the thing we, we really need to avoid and will avoid.","Q&A","Press Conf","","229","2023-07"

"2023-07-26","Good afternoon. My colleagues and I remain squarely focused on our dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people. We understand the hardship that high inflation is causing, and we remain strongly committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal. Price stability is the responsibility of the Federal Reserve. Without price stability, the economy doesn’t work for anyone. In particular, without price stability, we will not achieve a sustained period of strong labor market conditions that benefit all. Since early last year, the FOMC has significantly tightened the stance of monetary policy. Today we took another step by raising our policy interest rate ¼ percentage point, and we are continuing to reduce our securities holdings at a brisk pace. We’ve covered a lot of ground, and the full effects of our tightening have yet to be felt. Looking ahead, we will continue to take a data-dependent approach in determining the extent of additional policy firming that may be appropriate. I’ll have more to say about monetary policy after briefly reviewing economic developments. Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has been expanding at a moderate pace. Growth in consumer spending appears to have slowed from earlier in the year. Although activity in the housing sector has picked up somewhat, it remains well below levels of a year ago, largely reflecting higher mortgage rates. And higher interest rates and slower output growth also appear to be weighing on business fixed investment. The labor market remains very tight. Over the past three months, job gains averaged 244,000 jobs per month, a pace below that seen earlier in the year but still a strong pace. The unemployment rate remains low at 3.6 percent. There are some continuing signs that supply and has shown some signs of easing, and job vacancies have declined so far this year. While the jobs-to-workers gap has narrowed, labor demand still substantially exceeds the supply of available workers. Inflation remains well above our longer-run goal of 2 percent. Over the 12 months ending in May, total PCE prices rose 3.8 percent; excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 4.6 percent. In June, the 12-month change in the consumer price index, or CPI, came in at 3.0 percent, and the change in the core, core CPI, was 4.8 percent. Inflation has moderated somewhat since the middle of last year. Nonetheless, the process of getting inflation back down to 2 percent has a long way to go. Despite elevated inflation, longer-term inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters, as well as measures from financial markets. The Fed’s monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people. My colleagues and I are acutely aware that high inflation imposes significant—significant hardship, as it erodes purchasing power, especially for those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation. We’re highly attentive to the risks that high inflation poses to both sides of our mandate, and we are strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent objective. At today’s meeting, the Committee raised the target range for the federal funds rate by ¼ percentage point, bringing the target range to 5¼ to 5½ percent. We are also continuing the process of significantly reducing our securities holdings. With today’s action, we’ve raised our particularly housing and investment. It will take time, however, for the full effects of our ongoing monetary restraint to be realized, especially on inflation. In addition, the economy is facing headwinds from tighter credit conditions for households and businesses, which are likely to weigh on economic activity, hiring, and inflation. In determining the extent of additional policy firming that may be appropriate to return inflation to 2 percent over time, the Committee will take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial developments. We will continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting, based on the totality of the incoming data and their implications for the outlook for economic activity and inflation, as well as the balance of risks. We remain committed to bringing inflation back to our 2 percent goal and to keeping longer-term inflation expectations well anchored. Reducing inflation is likely to require a period of below-trend growth and some softening of labor market conditions. Restoring price stability is essential to set the stage for achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the longer run. To conclude: We understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission. We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum-employment and price-stability goals. Thank you, and","Opening Statement","Press Conf","","814","2023-07"
"2023-07-26","So we haven’t made a decision to go to every other meeting. It’s not something we’ve looked at. We’re going to be going meeting by meeting, and as we go into each meeting, we’re going to be asking ourselves the same questions. So we haven’t made any decisions about, about any future meetings, including the pace at which we’d consider hiking. But we’re going to be assessing the need for further tightening that may be appropriate—you read the language—“to return inflation to 2 percent over time.” I would say that the intermeeting data came in broadly in line with expectations: Economic activity remained resilient, job creation remains strong while cooling a bit, and the June CPI report actually came in a bit better than expectations for a change. And the June CPI report, of course, was welcomed, but it’s only one report, one month’s data. We hope that inflation will follow a lower path, as was—that will be consistent with the CPI reading, but we don’t know that, and we’re just going to need to see more data. So, what are we going to be looking at? Really, it will be the broader, the whole broader picture, and starting with—we’re looking for moderate growth, right? We’re looking for supply and demand through the economy coming into better balance, including, in particular, in the labor market. We’ll be looking at inflation. We’ll be asking ourselves, does this whole collection of data, do we assess it as suggesting that we need to raise rates further? And if we make that conclusion, then we will go ahead and raise rates. So that’s how we’re thinking about I will also say, since we’re talking about it, between now and the September meeting, we get two more job reports, two more CPI reports. I think we have an ECI report coming later this week—which is [an] employment compensation index—and lots of data on economic activity. All of that information is going to inform our decision as we go into that meeting. I would say it is certainly possible that we would raise funds again at the September meeting if the data warrant it, and I would also say it’s possible that we would choose to hold steady at that meeting. We’re going to be making careful assessments, as I said, meeting by meeting, and I’ll close by saying we’ve raised the federal funds rate now by 525 basis points since March 2022. Monetary policy, we believe, is restrictive and is putting downward pressure on economic activity and inflation.","Q&A","Press Conf","","423","2023-07"
"2023-07-26","I’m just going to go back to what I said. We, we—you know, that’s the question. We have eight weeks now until the September meeting, and all that data that I recited, we’re going to be looking at all that and making that assessment then. And it really—we did have the one good reading, and, of course, we welcome that. But it’s just one reading, as everybody knows. And, and, you know, we’ve seen—we’ve seen this before in the data. Many forecasts call for, for rates—for, for inflation to remain low, but we just don’t know that until we see the data. So we’ll be focusing on that.","Q&A","Press Conf","","108","2023-07"
"2023-07-26","Yeah. So I would say it this way: The overall resilience of the economy, the fact that, that we’ve been able to achieve disinflation so far without any meaningful negative impact on the labor market, the strength of the economy—overall, that’s a good thing. It’s good to see that, of course. It’s also—you see consumer, consumer confidence coming up and things like that. That will support activity going forward. But you’re, you’re right, though. At the margin, stronger growth could lead, over time, to higher inflation, and that would require an appropriate response for monetary policy. So we’ll be watching that carefully and seeing how it evolves over time.","Q&A","Press Conf","","109","2023-07"
"2023-07-26","So it’s hard to pick the pieces apart and say, you know, how much of this and how much of that. You know, we’ll be looking at everything. And, you know, we’ll, of course, we’ll be looking to see whether the signal from June’s CPI is replicated or, or the opposite of replicated or whether it’s somewhere in the middle. We’ll be looking at the growth data. We’ll be looking at the labor market data very closely, of course, and making an overall","Q&A","Press Conf","","83","2023-07"
"2023-07-26","So I’m just going to tell you again what we’re going to do. In September, we’re going to look at, at two additional job reports, two additional CPI reports, lots of activity data, and that’s what we’re going to look at, and we’re going to make that decision then. And that decision could, could mean another hike in, in September, or it could mean that we decide to maintain at that level. And, again, the question we’re going to be asking ourselves is, is the overall signal one that we need to do more, that we need to tighten further? And if we get that signal, whenever we get it, then—and that’s the collective judgment of the Committee— then we will move ahead. If we don’t, you know, then, then we’ll have the option of maintaining policy at that level, but it’s, it’s, you know, it’s really dependent so much on the data, and we just don’t have it yet.","Q&A","Press Conf","","160","2023-07"
"2023-07-26","So I guess I would put it this way. We, we—I’d say it this way: It’s really a question of, how do you balance the two risks, the risk of doing too much or doing too little? And, you know, I would say that, you know, we’re coming to a place where, where there really are risks on both sides. It’s hard to say exactly whether, whether they’re in balance or not, but as our—as our stance has become more restrictive and inflation moderates, we do increasingly face that risk. But, you know, we, we need to see that inflation is durably down that far, you know. As you know, we think, and most economists think, that core inflation is actually a better signal of, of where headline inflation is going, because headline inflation is affected greatly by volatile energy and food prices. So we would want core inflation to be coming down, because that’s what we think—that’s—core is signaling where headline is going to go in the future. And core inflation is still pretty elevated, you know? There’s reason to think it can come down now, but it’s, it’s still quite elevated, and so we think we need to stay on task, and we think we’re","Q&A","Press Conf","","207","2023-07"
"2023-07-26","So I’ll just say again, the broader picture of what we want to see is, we want to see easing of supply constraints and normalization of pandemic-related distortions to demand and supply. We want to see economic growth running at moderate or modest levels to help ease inflationary pressures. We want to see continued restoration of supply and demand balance, particularly in the labor market. And all of that should lead to declining inflationary pressures. Now what we see is, we see those pieces of the puzzle coming together. And we’re seeing evidence of those things now, but I would—I would say that what, what our eyes are telling us is that policy has not been restrictive long, restrictive enough for long enough to have its full desired effects. So we intend, again, to keep policy restrictive until we’re confident that inflation is coming down sustainably to our 2 percent target, and we’re prepared to further tighten if that is appropriate. And we think the process, you know, still probably has a, a long way to go.","Q&A","Press Conf","","177","2023-07"
"2023-07-26","So a more gradual pace doesn’t go immediately to [moving] every other meeting. It could be two out of three meetings, right? It could be—it just means if you’re slowing down, the point really was to slow down the decision cycle as, as we get closer and closer to, we think, our destination. And I wouldn’t want to go automatically to [moving] every other meeting, because I just don’t think that’s—we don’t—I think it’s not an environment where we want to provide a lot of forward guidance. There’s a lot of uncertainty out there. We just want to keep moving at what we think is the right pace, and I do think it makes all the sense in the world to slow down as we now make these finely judged decisions, and so that’s what we did. And so I, I think it’s possible. I mentioned it before. It’s possible that we would move at consecutive meetings—we’re not taking that off the table—or we might not. It’s really going to depend on what the data tell us. That’s the best we can do.","Q&A","Press Conf","","183","2023-07"
"2023-07-26","So there’s a long-running debate about the lags between changes in financial conditions and the response to those changes from economic activity and inflation, right? So we know that in the modern era, financial conditions move in anticipation of our decisions, and that has clearly been the case in this cycle. So, in a sense, the clock starts earlier than it—than it used to. But that doesn’t necessarily change the process from that point on, and it’s not clear that it has. We also—this is—I’ll tell you what we know and then what we don’t know. We know that financial conditions affect economic activity and inflation with a lag that can be long and variable, or lags, plural, that can be long and variable—a lot of uncertainty around the length of the lags. And, by the way, that’s just one component of the broader uncertainty that we face. So I’ll tell you how I—how I think about this. First, the first thing to say is, we’re determined to bring inflation down to 2 percent over time, and we will use our tools to do that. No one should doubt that. I would look at it this way, though. The real federal funds rate is now in meaningfully positive territory. If you take the nominal federal funds rate, subtract the mainstream estimate of near-term inflation expectations, you get a real federal funds rate that is economic activity and inflation. We’ll keep monetary policy restrictive until we think it’s not appropriate to do so. So that’s how I think about it. I mean, if I sum it up, I would say: We’ve come a long way. We are resolutely committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent goal over time. Inflation has proved, repeatedly, has proved stronger than we and other forecasts—forecasters have expected, and at some point, that may change. We have to be ready to follow the data, and given how far we’ve come, we can afford to be a little patient, as well as resolute, as we let this unfold.","Q&A","Press Conf","","341","2023-07"
"2023-07-26","So I guess that the SLOOS will come out early next week, and I would just say it’s broadly condition—consistent with what you would expect. You’ve got lending conditions tight and getting a little tighter. You’ve got weak demand, and, you know, it, it gives a picture of pretty tight credit conditions in the economy. I think it’s really hard to tease out whether—how much of that is from this source or that source, but I think what matters is, the overall picture is of tight and tightening lending conditions. And that’s, that’s what the SLOOS will say.","Q&A","Press Conf","","98","2023-07"
"2023-07-26","Yeah. So, interesting question. So let me start by saying that the inflation surge that we saw in the pandemic resulted from a collision of elevated demand and, and constrained supply, both of which followed from the unprecedented features of the pandemic and the response from fiscal and monetary policy. And we’ve always expected that the disinflationary process would stem from, both from the normalization of those broad pandemic- related supply and demand conditions and from restrictive, restrictive monetary policy, which would help return the balance between supply and demand by restraining demand. And we think that’s broadly what we’re—what we’re seeing. So to go, break it down a little further: Of course, headline inflation has come down sharply from elevated levels as energy and food prices have come down, mostly due to [a] reversal of the effects [on those prices that resulted] from the war in Ukraine. And that’s, that’s a good thing, and the public experiences that, as I mentioned earlier. For core inflation, I’d say there also—there has been a role for, for most—for, for both factors, both that I mentioned. Clearly, for goods, normalization of supply conditions is playing an important role, as is the reversal, the beginning of the reversal, of spending—back into services and away from goods. And take autos as an example. The combination of an increase in sales and inventories, while, while vehicle inflation has decelerated, points to a substantial role for supply, but there’s rates have, have slowed the housing market. You know, I would say, monetary policy is working about as we expect, and we think—we think it’ll play an important role going forward, in particular in nonhousing services, where, really, we think that’s, that’s where the labor market will come in as a very, very important factor. So we think both of those—both of those sources of disinflation are playing an important role.","Q&A","Press Conf","","314","2023-07"
"2023-07-26","I think monetary policy is going to be important going forward because we, we’re sort of reaping now the benefits of the—of the reversal of some of the very specific pandemic things. We’re seeing that with goods, in particular, with supply chains and shortages moving, and we’re seeing—so I think going forward, monetary policy will be important, particularly in that, in the sector, in the nonhousing services sector.","Q&A","Press Conf","","68","2023-07"
"2023-07-26","So I think that, as it relates to goods, it’s really an indication that supply chains and, and shortages are easing. And so, what was the first part of it?","Q&A","Press Conf","","30","2023-07"
"2023-07-26","I don’t—I don’t think we’re targeting wage inflation. I think what we’re—what we’re looking for is a broad cooling in labor market conditions. And that’s what we’re seeing. So wages have actually been gradually moving down. They’re still at levels what would—that would be consistent over a long period of time with 2 percent inflation. Nonetheless, we’re making progress there. And by so many indicators, labor market demand is cooling. You can—you can look at surveys by workers and businesses who see that. You can look at the quits rate normalizing. You can look at job openings coming down. You can look at just job creation in the, the establishment survey has, you know—it’s still at a high level, but it was at, really, an extraordinarily high level for most of the last two years. So you see cooling, particularly in private sector, in the last, you know, in the last report. So I think we see that, and it’s happening at a gradual pace. So that’s actually not a bad thing, in a sense, because if, if what we see is a labor market, very strong demand for labor, which is really the engine of the economy—people are getting hired, many people going back to work, getting wages, spending money—and that’s really what’s driving the economy but that it’s gradually slowing, it’s gradually cooling, that’s a good prescription for getting where we want to get.","Q&A","Press Conf","","236","2023-07"
"2023-07-26","I’m not going—I’m not saying that at all. I’m not giving you any numerical guidance around that. I’m saying we would—we’d be comfortable cutting rates when we’re comfortable cutting rates, and that won’t be this year, I don’t think. It would be—you know, many people wrote down rate cuts for next year. I think the median was several for next year. And that’s just going to be a judgment that we have to make then, a full year from now,","Q&A","Press Conf","","80","2023-07"
"2023-07-26","So it’s, it has been my view consistently that we do have a shot, and my base case is that we will be able to achieve inflation moving back down to our target without the kind of really significant downturn that results in high levels of job losses that we’ve seen in some past—in some past instances, many past instances of tightening that look like ours. That’s been my view. That’s, that’s still my view. And I think, you know, that that’s sort of consistent with, with what I see today. So—but it’s a long way from assured, and, and, you know, we have a lot left to go to see that happen. So the staff now has a noticeable slowdown in growth starting later this year in the forecast, but given the resilience of the economy recently, they are no longer forecasting a recession. I just want to note that it’s—that our staff produces its own forecast, which is independent of the forecasts that we as FOMC participants produce. Having an independent staff forecast as well as the individual participant forecasts is really a strength of our—of our process. There’s just a lot of, I think, constructive diversity of opinion that, that helps us make— informs our deliberations—helps us make, I hope, better decisions.","Q&A","Press Conf","","215","2023-07"
"2023-07-26","I wouldn’t use the term “optimism” about this yet. I would—I would say, though, that there’s a pathway, and, yes, that’s, that’s a good way to think about it. We’ve, we’ve seen so far the beginnings of disinflation without any real costs in the labor market. And that’s, that’s a really good thing. I would just also say the historical record suggests that there’s very likely to be some softening in labor market conditions. And consistent with having a soft landing, you would—you would have some softening in labor market conditions, and that’s still likely as we—as we go forward with this process. But it’s a good thing to date that we haven’t— we haven’t really seen that. We’ve seen softening through other—not through unemployment, not through higher unemployment. We’ve seen softening through, you know, job openings coming down part of the way back to more normal levels; the quits rate, so people are not quitting as much; we’ve seen participation—people coming in, and so labor supply has, has improved, which has lowered the temperature in the labor market, which was quite overheated, you know, going back a year or so. So we’re seeing that kind of cooling, and that’s, that’s very healthy, and, you know, we hope it continues.","Q&A","Press Conf","","210","2023-07"
"2023-07-26","So the idea that we would keep hiking until inflation gets to 2 percent—it would be a prescription [for a policy] of going way past the target. That’s, that’s clearly not the appropriate way to think about it. So, and in fact, if you look at our forecast, we, we—the median participant—and, again, these are forecasting out years, so take them with a grain of salt. But people are cutting rates next year because, because, you know, the federal funds rate is at a restrictive level now. So if we see inflation coming down credibly, sustainably, then we don’t need to be at a restrictive level anymore. We can, you know, we can move back to a—to a neutral level and then below a neutral level at a certain point. I think we would, you know, we would—we, of course, would be very careful about that. We’d really want to be sure that inflation is coming down in a sustainable level. And it’s hard to make—I’m not going to try to make a numerical assessment of when and where that would be. But that’s the way I would think about it, is you’d start—you’d stop raising long before you got to 2 percent inflation, and you’d start cutting before you got to 2 percent inflation, too, because we don’t see ourselves getting to 2 percent inflation until—you know, all the way back to 2—until 2025 or so.","Q&A","Press Conf","","237","2023-07"
"2023-07-26","So I don’t want to comment on any particular merger proposal, but I will say, things have settled down for sure out there. Deposit flows have stabilized. Capital and liquidity remain strong. Aggregate bank lending was stable quarter over quarter and is up significantly year over year. Banking-sector profits generally are coming in strong this quarter. And, overall, the banking system remains strong and resilient. Of course, we’re still watching, you know, the situation carefully and monitoring, you know, monitoring conditions in, in the banking sector. In terms of the, the actual effect on—if you think of a particular set of banks that were, were affected because of their size and business model and things like that, that were more affected by the turmoil in March than others, it’s very hard, as I mentioned; it’s very hard to sort of tease out the effects on this very large economy of ours from them tightening. They may be tightening a little bit more, probably are, than other banks. The SLOOS has been telling us for more than a year that banking conditions are tightening. That process is ongoing, and that will restrain economic growth. So I think—I think we have to take a step back from “I can’t separate those anymore.” I think—I think, basically, we’re just looking at the overall picture, which is one of tightening credit conditions. And that’s, that’s going to restrain economic activity. It is restraining economic activity. So that’s how I would look at it.","Q&A","Press Conf","","249","2023-07"
"2023-07-26","Well, [growth in nominal] wages in excess of inflation means [that increases in] real wages are positive. Again, that’s a great thing. Of course, we want that. We want people to have [gains in] real wages. But we want wages to be going up at a level that’s consistent with, with 2 percent inflation over time. As I mentioned, [increases in] nominal wages have been coming down gradually, and that’s what we want to see. We expect to see more of that. That’s just more of what’s consistent over a longer period of time. We don’t really think that, that wages were an important cause of inflation in the first year or so of the outbreak. But I would say that wages are probably an important issue going forward. Labor market conditions broadly are going to be an important part of, of getting inflation back down, and that’s why we think we need some further softening in labor market conditions. be some sort of a rebound there, and I’m curious what the Fed’s explanation would be to families if further interest rate hikes start to hit the labor market—start to, you know, drive that sentiment back down.

"2023-07-26","Well, you know, we have a job assigned to us by Congress to get inflation under control. And we think the, the single most important thing we can do to benefit those very families, especially families at the lower end of the income spectrum, is to get inflation sustainably under control and restore price stability. We think that is the most important thing we can do now, and we’re determined to do that. And I would just point out that the people who are the most hurt by inflation right away are people who are on a low fixed income, who, you know, when you’re talking about travel or, you know, transportation costs, heating costs, clothing, food, things like that, those—if you’re just making it through each month on your paycheck and prices go up, you’re in trouble right away. Even middle-class people have some resources and can absorb inflation. People, people on the lower end of the income spectrum have a harder time doing that. So we need—we need to get this done. And, you know, the record is clear that if we—if we take too long or if, if we don’t succeed, that the pain will only be greater.

It’s the dollar and equities, but—and, you know, we’re, of course, very focused on rates and our own policy. You know, we will—we’re going to use our policy tools to—working through financial conditions—to get inflation under control The implication is, you know, we will do what it takes to get inflation down, and in principle, that, that could mean that if financial conditions get looser, we have to do more. But what tends to happen,","Q&A","Press Conf","","87","2023-07"
"2023-07-26","So that, that could happen. The question is, you know, is that consistent with, with—so if you think about both of them as normalization, imagine it’s a world where things are okay, and it’s time to bring rates down from what are restrictive levels to more normal levels. Normalization, in the case of, of the balance sheet, would be to reduce QT or to continue it, depending on where you are in the cycle. So they are two independent things. And, you know, really, the active tool of monetary policy is rates.

"2023-07-26","I think we’ve got a ways to go to get back to balance, really, for the reasons that you talked about. With existing homes, you know, there are many people who have low-rate mortgages, and whereas they might want to sell in a normal situation, they’re not going to because they have such, so much, value in their mortgage, whch means that supply of existing homes is really, really tight, which is keeping prices up. On the other hand, there’s, you know, there’s a lot of supply coming on line now, and, and there are people coming in. A lot of the buyers are, are, you know, first-time buyers coming in, buying at, you know, with these, you know, with these relatively elevated mortgage rates.

And when, when people are writing down rate cuts next year, you know, it just is a sense that inflation is coming down, and we’re comfortable that it’s coming down, and it’s time to start cutting rates. I think—but I mean, there’s a lot of uncertainty between what happens, you know, in the next meeting cycle, let alone the next year, let alone the year after that.

"2023-09-20","Well, forecasts are highly uncertain. Forecasting is very difficult. Forecasters are a humble lot with much to be humble about. But to get to, to your question, though—what’s happened is, growth has come in stronger, right? Stronger than expected—and that’s required higher rates. Unemployment, you know—you also see that the, the ultimate unemployment rate is not as high, but that—that’s really because of what we’ve been seeing in the labor market. We’ve seen more and more progress in the labor market without seeing significantly higher unemployment. So we’re, we’re continuing that trend. In terms of inflation, you, you are seeing—the last three readings are, are very good readings. It’s only three readings, you know. We—we’re well aware that we need to see more than three readings. But if you look at June, July, and August, you’re looking at, you know, really significant declines in core inflation, largely in the goods sector—also to some extent in housing services and just a little in nonhousing services. Those are the three buckets. Headline inflation, of course, has come way forecasts. But these are—these are our forecasts. You know, they’re, they’re—we have very high-quality people working on these forecasts, and I think they stand up well against other forecasters. But just the nature of the business is, the economy is very difficult to forecast.","Q&A","Press Conf","","220","2023-09"
"2023-09-20","You know, yes. I mean, if you’re looking—if—we, we can tell how much inflation has gone up in a given month, right? And, you know, that’s what we’re looking at. And month by month, what’s the reading? And, you know, I think—I think what we’re really looking at is, there’s a tendency to look at, you know, shorter and shorter maturities, but they’re incredibly volatile, and they can be misleading. That’s why we look at 12-month [rates]. So you’re looking at it over that period and over longer periods. That—that’s the right way to go. And we don’t—we don’t need to be in a hurry to—in, in getting to a conclusion about what to do. We can let the data evolve. So—","Q&A","Press Conf","","122","2023-09"
"2023-09-20","Base factors. Ah. Okay. So on that, we’re, you know, we’re looking at just monthly, right? You can look at just monthly readings and see what the increase was from the prior month. So you’re right—when you go back 3, 6, and 12 months, you get base factors. But we can—we can adjust for that. In terms of not getting data—you know, again, we don’t—we don’t comment on government shutdowns. It—it’s possible—if, if there is a government shutdown and it lasts through the, the next meeting, then it’s possible we wouldn’t— we wouldn’t be getting some of the data that we would ordinarily get, and we—you know, we would just have to deal with that. And I don’t know. It’s hard for me to say in advance how that would affect that meeting. It would depend on all kinds of factors that I don’t know about now. But it’s certainly a reality that, that that’s a possibility.","Q&A","Press Conf","","157","2023-09"
"2023-09-20","Sorry—yeah, I missed the first question. What was—missed what factors?","Q&A","Press Conf","","10","2023-09"
"2023-09-20","Well, I, I think we have come very far very fast in, in the, the rate increases that we’ve made. And I think it was important at the beginning that we move quickly, and we did. And, and I think as we get closer to the rate that we think—the stance of monetary policy that we think is appropriate to bring inflation down to 2 percent over time, you know, the risks become more two sided, and the risk of overtightening and the risk of, of undertightening becomes more equal. And I think the, the natural, commonsense thing to do is, as you approach that, you move a little more slowly as you get closer to it. And that, that’s what we’re doing. So we’re, we’re taking advantage of the fact that we have moved quickly to move a little more carefully now as we—as we sort of find our way to, to the right level of restriction that we need to get inflation back down to 2 percent.","Q&A","Press Conf","","169","2023-09"
"2023-09-20","So if I—if I understood your question, it’s—I would say it this way: I think we knew from the time—from before when we lifted off, but certainly by the time we lift—we knew that bringing inflation back down was going to take, as I call it, the unwinding of these distortions to both supply and demand that happened because of the pandemic and the response. So that unwinding was going to be important. In addition, monetary policy was going to help. It was going to help supply side heal by, by cooling demand off and, just in general, work now, and I think they’re at work in a way that shows you the progress that we—that we are seeing.","Q&A","Press Conf","","119","2023-09"
"2023-09-20","To begin: A soft landing is a primary objective, and I did not say otherwise. I mean, that’s, that’s what we’ve been trying to achieve for all this time. comes back, and you go through—you can have a long period where the economy’s just very uncertain, and it will affect growth; it will affect all kinds of things. It can be a miserable period to have inflation constantly coming back and the Fed coming in and having to tighten again and again. So the best thing we can do for everyone, we believe, is to restore price stability. I think now, today, we actually—you know, we, we have the ability to be careful at this point and move carefully, and that’s what we’re planning to do. So we fully appreciate that—you know, the benefits of being able to continue what we see already, which is rebalancing in the labor market and inflation coming down without seeing, you know, an important, large increase in unemployment, which has been typical of other tightening cycles. So—","Q&A","Press Conf","","173","2023-09"
"2023-09-20","So I, I think the question will be—GDP is not our mandate, right? Maximum employment and price stability are the mandates. The question will be, is, is the level—is GDP—is the—is the heat that we see in GDP—is it really a threat to our ability to get back to 2 percent inflation? That’s going to be the question. It’s not—it’s not a question about GDP on its own. It’s, you—you know, you’re expecting to see the—this improvement, you know—continued rebalancing in the labor market and inflation moving back down to 2 percent","Q&A","Press Conf","","92","2023-09"
"2023-09-20","The economic forecast prepared by the staff for the September FOMC meeting was stronger than the July projection, as consumer and business spending appeared to be more resilient to tight financial conditions than previously expected.","Staff Economic Outlook","Minutes","N/A","35","2023-09"
"2023-09-20","So there is a—there is a long list, and you hit some of them. But it— you know, it’s, it’s the strike, it’s government shutdown, resumption of student loan payments, higher long-term rates, oil price shock. You know, you could—there are a lot of things that you can—you can look at. And, you know—so, what we try to do is assess all of them and, and handicap all of them. And, ultimately, though, there’s so much uncertainty around, around these things. I mean, to, to start with the strike—first of all, we absolutely don’t comment on the strike, as we have no view on the strike one way or the other. But we, we do have to make an assessment of its economic effects to do our jobs. So, you know, the, the thing about it is—so uncertain. It will depend. The economic effects—it could affect—you’ve looked—we’ve looked back at history—it could affect economic output, hiring, and inflation. But that’s really going to depend on how broad it is and how long it’s sustained for. And we—and then it also depends on how quickly production can make up for, for lost production. So none of those things are known right now. It’s very, very hard to know. So you just have to leave that uncertain. And, and we’ll be learning, I think, over the course of the next intermeeting period, much more about that. And the same is true for the others. We, we—I don’t know if you You know, energy prices being higher—that’s—that is a significant thing. We—energy prices being up can affect spending. It can affect the consumer over time. A sustained period of higher—of higher energy prices can affect consumer expectations about inflation. We tend to look through short-term volatility and look at—look at core inflation. But so the question is, how long are, are higher prices sustained? We have to—we have to take those macroeconomic effects into account as well. Those are—those are some of them. I’m not sure if I hit them all. But—I mean, ultimately, you know, you’re, you’re coming into this with an economy that appears to have significant momentum. And that’s, that’s what we start with. And we—but we do have this collection of risks that you mentioned.","Q&A","Press Conf","","376","2023-09"

"2023-09-20","So on, on your first question—I mean, we’re looking at GDP very, very carefully to try to understand really what’s the direction of it—what’s, what’s driving it. And it’s, it’s a lot of consumer spending, you know. It’s been—the consumer’s been very robust in its—in spending. So that is, you know, that’s how we’re looking at it. Sorry, your second question was—","Q&A","Press Conf","","62","2023-09"
"2023-09-20","So, to, to finish my prior thought, I was saying that’s why we tend to look through energy moves that we—that we can see as, as short-term volatility. You know, turning to consumer credit, you know—of course, we watch that carefully. Consumer distress— measures of distress among consumers were at historic lows quite recently, you know, after— during and after the, the pandemic. They’re now moving back up to normal. We’re, we’re watching that carefully. But, at this point, these, these readings are not at troublingly high levels. They’re, they’re just kind of moving back up to what was the typical [level] in the pre-pandemic era.","Q&A","Press Conf","","106","2023-09"
"2023-09-20","Right. So, you know, energy prices are very important for the consumer. This, this can affect consumer spending. It certainly can affect consumer sentiment. I mean, gas prices are one of the big things that, that affects consumer sentiment. It, it really comes down to how persistent—how sustained these energy prices are. The reason why we look at core inflation, which excludes food and energy, is that energy goes up and down like that. And it doesn’t—energy, energy prices mostly, mostly don’t contain much of a signal about how tight the economy is, and hence don’t tell you much about where inflation’s really going. However, we’re well aware, though, that, that, you know, if energy prices increase and stay high, that’ll have an effect on spending. And, and it may have an effect on, on consumer expectations of inflation—things like that. That’s just things we have to monitor.","Q&A","Press Conf","","148","2023-09"
"2023-09-20","So you’re right. You know, rates have moved up significantly. I think it’s always hard to say precisely, but it’s—most, most people do a common decomposition of the increase, and they’ll, they’ll—the view will be, it’s not—it’s not mostly about inflation expectations. It’s mostly about other things, you know—either term premium or real yields— and it’s, it’s hard to be precise about this. Of course, everyone’s got models that’ll give you a very precise answer, but they give you different answers. So—but, essentially, they’re, they’re moving up because—it’s not because of inflation. It’s because probably—it’ll probably have","Q&A","Press Conf","","97","2023-09"
"2023-09-20","So on the supply point—of course, supply is very important over time in, in setting house prices and, and, for that matter, rents. And so—and supply is kind of structurally constrained. But in terms of, of where inflation’s going in the near term, though, as, as you obviously know, a lot of it is, is leases that are running off and then being re-signed or re- leased at a level that’s, that’s not as—it won’t be that much higher. A year ago, it would have been much higher than it was a year before; now it may be below or at the same level. So as those leases are rolling over, we’re, we’re seeing what we expect, which is measured housing services inflation coming down. Your second question was the lock-ins. How much is that affecting things, really? lock-in that sort of stagnates the housing market?","Q&A","Press Conf","","146","2023-09"
"2023-09-20","I, I think we look at the—I would look at the lock-in, the, the idea being that people are in, in very low mortgage—very low-rate mortgages, and if—even if they want to move now, they—it would be hard because the new mortgage would be so expensive. And that’s explaining some of the—that’s one of the explanations for what’s happening broadly in the labor market. Would that play a role in, in our future decisions—in a—in a future tight— in a future loosening cycle about whether we would cut rates? No, I, I don’t think it would. I mean, I don’t think that’s—I, I think we’d be looking at, what, you know, fundamentally, what, what rates does the economy need? And, and, you know, in, in an emergency like the pandemic or during the Global Financial Crisis, you, you know, the, the—you have to cut rates to the point that—you have to do, do what you can to support the economy. So I wouldn’t—I wouldn’t think that that would be a reason for us not to do that. It’s not something we’re thinking about at all right now. But, down the road, I wouldn’t think so.","Q&A","Press Conf","","195","2023-09"
"2023-09-20","I, I wouldn’t say it that way. We’re not looking for a decrease in consumer spending. It’s, it’s a good thing that the economy’s strong. It’s a good thing that the comes in stronger than expected, that just means we’ll have to do more in terms of monetary policy to get back to 2 percent—because we will get back to 2 percent. Does that answer your question?","Q&A","Press Conf","","67","2023-09"
"2023-09-20","Well, that’s always a concern. I mean, concern number one is, is restoring price stability, because in the long run, that’s, that’s something we have to do so that we can have the kind of economy we really want, which is one with sustained period of tight labor market conditions that benefit all, as I—as I’ve said a couple times. So that, that said—of course, you know—we, we also now, given how far we’ve come with our rate hikes and how quickly we’ve come here, we do have the ability to be careful as we move forward because of that consideration.","Q&A","Press Conf","","101","2023-09"

So, so please—I, I wouldn’t want to be taken that way. Sorry— the first question was, is that how? Yeah, so we’re—as we go into next year, that’s the question we’ll be asking is—you know, taking into account lags and, and everything else we know about the economy and everything we know about monetary policy, the, the time will come at some point, and I’m not saying when, that it’s—that it’s appropriate to cut. Part of that may be that real rates are rising because inflation is coming down. Part of it just may be that—it’ll be all the factors that we see in the economy. And, you know, that time will certainly come at some point. when we—in the moment, we’ll do what we think makes sense. No one will look back at this and say, “Hey, we made a plan.” It’s not like that at all. It’s—this is—these are estimates made a year in advance that are highly uncertain, and that’s how it is.","Q&A","Press Conf","","197","2023-09"
"2023-09-20","So, what—I guess it’s fair—it’s fair to say that the economy has been stronger than many expected, given, given what’s been happening with, with interest rates. Why is that? Many candidate explanations—possibly—a number of them make sense. One, one is just that household balance sheets and business balance sheets have been stronger than we had understood, and so that, that spending has held up—and that kind of thing. We’re not sure about that. The savings rate for consumers has come down a lot. The question is whether that’s sustainable. That could—it could just mean that the—that the date of effect is, is later. It could also be that for other reasons, the neutral rate of interest is, is higher for—for various reasons. We don’t know that. It could also just be that policy hasn’t been restrictive enough for long enough. And it’s—there are many candidate explanations. We have to, in, in all this uncertainty, make policy, and I, you know, I feel like what we have right now is what’s still a very strong labor market—but that’s coming back into balance. We were making progress on inflation. Growth is strong. But I think by many forecasts—many, many, many forecasts call for growth to, to moderate over the course of the next year. So that’s where we are, and, you know, we have to—we have to deal with what comes. On your second question, which was— sorry, your second question was distributional, but can you—can you be a little clearer about that?","Q&A","Press Conf","","251","2023-09"
"2023-09-20","I mean, yes—we, we understand that it’s a real rate that will matter and that needs to be sufficiently restrictive. And, again, I would say, you know—you know “sufficiently restrictive” only when you see it. You—it’s not something you can arrive at with confidence in a model or, or in various estimates, you know. And so what are we seeing? We’re, we’re seeing, you know, through a combination of the, you know, the unwinding of the pandemic-related demand and supply distortions and monetary policy’s work in suppressing goods—also in housing services. You begin to see effects of it in nonhousing services as well. So I think—we think that that is working. And I, I think, you know—as we’ve said, we, we want to reach that—we want to reach something that we’re confident gets us to that level. And I think confidence comes from seeing, you know, enough data that you feel like, “Yes, okay, this feels like it—we can—we can, for now, decide that this is the right level and just agree to stay here.” We’re not permanently deciding not to go higher, but, but we would—let’s say, if we get to that level—and then the question is, how long do you stay at that level? And that’s a whole other set of questions. For now, the question is trying to find that level where we think we can stay there. And we haven’t—we haven’t gotten to a point of confidence about that yet. That’s, that’s what we’re—that’s, that’s the stage we’re at, though.","Q&A","Press Conf","","254","2023-09"
"2023-09-20","The decision that we make at, you know, at each meeting and, certainly, at the—at the last two meetings this year—it’s going to depend on the totality of all the data: so, the inflation data, the labor market data, the growth data, the, the balance of risks, and the other events that are happening out there. We’ll make—we take all of that into account, so I can’t really answer a hypothetical about one piece of that. It’ll—it’ll be trying to reach a us be more confident that we’ve gotten to the level that we need to get to.","Q&A","Press Conf","","98","2023-09"
"2023-09-20","So I, I don’t know about the quarterly survey. That’s an idea we can—we can take away and think about. In terms of how low and moderate Americans—you know, they’re clearly—were suffering from, from high inflation. I think during the pandemic, the, the government transfers that happened were very meaningful. And, you know, if you know the—the surveys that we take showed that—showed that low- and moderate-income people were actually in very, very strong financial condition. I think now it’s a very “hot” labor market, and you’re seeing high [growth in] nominal wages, and you’re starting to see [that growth rates of] real wages are now positive by most—by most measures. So I, I think, overall, households are in good shape. Surveys are a different thing. So surveys are showing dissatisfaction, and I think a lot of that is just, people hate inflation—hate it. And that, that causes people to say, “The economy’s terrible.” But, at the same time, they’re spending money. Their behavior is, is not exactly what you would expect from the surveys. That’s kind of a, a guess at what the answer might be. But I, I think there’s a lot of good things happening on household balance sheets—and, certainly, in the labor market and with wages. The biggest wage increases having gone to relatively low- wage jobs—and now [with] inflation coming down—you’re seeing [increases in] real wages, which is a good thing. Thanks very much.","Q&A","Press Conf","","239","2023-09"
"2023-09-20","Good afternoon, everyone. My colleagues and I remain squarely focused on our dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people. We understand the hardship that high inflation is causing, and we remain strongly committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal. Price stability is the responsibility of the Federal Reserve. Without price stability, the economy does not work for anyone. In particular, without price stability, we will not achieve a sustained period of strong labor market conditions that benefit all. Since early last year, the FOMC has significantly tightened the stance of monetary policy. We’ve raised our policy interest rate by 5¼ percentage points and have continued to reduce our securities holdings at a brisk pace. We’ve covered a lot of ground, and the full effects of our tightening have yet to be felt. Today, we decided to leave our policy interest rate unchanged and to continue to reduce our securities holdings. Looking ahead, we’re in a position to proceed carefully in determining the extent of additional policy firming that may be appropriate. Our decisions will be based on our ongoing assessments of the incoming data and the evolving outlook and risks. I will have more to say about monetary policy after briefly reviewing economic developments. Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has been expanding at a solid pace, and, so far this year, growth in real GDP has come in above expectations. Recent readings on consumer spending have been particularly robust. Activity in the housing sector has picked up somewhat, though it remains well below levels of a year ago, largely reflecting higher mortgage rates. Higher interest rates also appear to be weighing on business fixed investment. In our Summary of Economic Projections, or SEP, Committee participants revised up their assessments The labor market remains tight, but supply and demand conditions continue to come into better balance. Over the past three months, payroll job gains averaged 150,000 jobs per month, a strong pace that is nevertheless well below that seen earlier in the year. The unemployment rate ticked up in August but remains low at 3.8 percent. The labor force participation rate has moved up since late last year, particularly for individuals aged 25 to 54 years. Nominal wage growth has shown some signs of easing, and job vacancies have declined so far this year. Although the jobs-to-workers gap has narrowed, labor demand still exceeds the supply of available workers. FOMC participants expect the rebalancing in the labor market to continue, easing upward pressures on inflation. The median unemployment rate projection in the SEP rises from 3.8 percent at the end of this year to 4.1 percent over the next two years. Inflation remains well above our longer-run goal of 2 percent. Based on the consumer price index, or CPI, and other data, we estimate that total PCE prices rose 3.4 percent over the 12 months ending in August and that, excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 3.9 percent. Inflation has moderated somewhat since the middle of last year, and longer-term inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters, as well as measures from financial markets. Nevertheless, the progress—process of getting inflation sustainably down to 2 percent has a long way to go. The median projection in the SEP for total PCE inflation is 3.3 percent this year, falls to 2.5 percent next year, and reaches 2 percent in 2026. The Fed’s monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people. My colleagues and I are acutely aware are highly attentive to the risks that high inflation poses to both sides of our mandate, and we’re strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent objective. As I noted earlier, since early last year, we have raised our policy rate by 5¼ percentage points. We see the current stance of monetary policy as restrictive, putting downward pressure on economic activity, hiring, and inflation. In addition, the economy is facing headwinds from tighter credit conditions for households and businesses. In light of how far we have come in tightening policy, the Committee decided at today’s meeting to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 5¼ to 5½ percent and to continue the process of significantly reducing our securities holdings. We are committed to achieving and sustaining a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation down to our 2 percent goal over time. In our SEP, FOMC participants wrote down their individual assessments of an appropriate path for the federal funds rate, based on what each participant judges to be the most likely—sorry—the most likely scenario going forward. If the economy evolves as projected, the median participant projects that the appropriate level of the federal funds rate will be 5.6 percent at the end of this year, 5.1 percent at the end of 2024, and 3.9 percent at the end of 2025. Compared with our June Summary of Economic Projections, the median projection is unrevised for the end of this year but has moved up by ½ percentage point at the end of the next two years. These projections, of course, are not a Committee decision or plan; if the economy does not evolve as projected, the path of policy will adjust as appropriate to foster our maximum-employment and price-stability goals. We will continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting, based on the totality of the Given how far we have come, we are in a position to proceed carefully as we assess the incoming data and the evolving outlook and risks. Real interest rates now are well above mainstream estimates of the neutral policy rate, but we are mindful of the inherent uncertainties in precisely gauging the stance of policy. We’re prepared to raise rates further if appropriate, and we intend to hold policy at a restrictive level until we’re confident that inflation is moving down sustainably toward our objective. In determining the extent of additional policy firming that may be appropriate to return inflation to 2 percent over time, the Committee will take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial developments. We remain committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal and to keeping longer-term inflation expectations well anchored. Reducing inflation is likely to require a period of below-trend growth and some softening of labor market conditions. Restoring price stability is essential to set the stage for achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the longer run. To conclude: We understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission. We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum-employment and price-stability goals. Thank you, and","Opening Statement","Press Conf","","1164","2023-09"
"2023-09-20","We’re not saying—yeah, no, no—clearly, we’re just—what we decided to do is maintain a policy rate and await further data. We want to see convincing evidence, really, that we have reached the appropriate level, and then, you know, we’re— we’ve—we’ve seen progress, and, and we welcome that. But, you know, we need to see more progress before we’ll be willing to—to reach that conclusion.","Q&A","Press Conf","","64","2023-09"
"2023-09-20","Right. So I would say it this way: First of all, interest rates—real interest rates are, are positive now. They’re meaningfully positive, and that’s a good thing. We need policy to be restrictive so that we can get inflation down to target. Okay. And we need— we’re going to need that to remain to be the case for some time. So I think, you know— remember that the—of course, the SEP is not a plan that is negotiated or discussed, really, as a plan. It’s a cumulation, really, and what you see are the medians. It’s a cumulation of individual forecasts from 19 people, and then what you’re seeing are the medians. So I wouldn’t want to, you know, bestow upon it the idea that, that it’s really a plan. But what it reflects, though, is that economic activity’s been stronger than we expected—stronger than I think everyone expected. And, and so what you’re—what you’re seeing is, this is what people believe, as of now, will be appropriate to achieve what we’re looking to achieve, which is progress toward our—toward our inflation goal, as you see in the","Q&A","Press Conf","","188","2023-09"
"2023-09-20","So I guess I would characterize the, the situation a little bit differently. So we decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate where it is—at 5¼ to 5½ percent—while continuing to reduce our securities holdings. And we say we’re committed to achieving and sustaining a stance of monetary policy that’s sufficiently restrictive to bring down inflation to 2 percent over time—we said that. But the fact that we decided to maintain the policy rate at this meeting doesn’t mean that we’ve decided that we have or have not at this time reached that—that stance of monetary policy that we’re seeking. If you looked at the SEP, as you—as you obviously will have done, you will see that a majority of participants believe that it is more likely than not that we will—that it will be appropriate for us to raise rates one more time in the two remaining meetings this year. Others believe that we have already reached that. So it’s, it’s something where we’re—by, by—we’re not making a decision by, by deciding to—about that question by deciding to just maintain the rate and await further data.","Q&A","Press Conf","","191","2023-09"
"2023-09-20","So, you know, you, you can make the argument that one hike one way or the other won’t matter. But, for us, we’re, we’re trying—obviously, as a group, it’s a pretty tight cluster of, of where we think that, that policy stance might be, but we’re always thought, what we wrote down—it’s actually gotten higher and higher. So we, we don’t really know until—and that’s why, again, we—we’re in a position to proceed carefully at this point. A year ago, we proceeded pretty quickly to get rates up. Now—now we’re fairly close, we think, to where we need to get. It’s, it’s just a question of reaching the right stance. I wouldn’t attribute huge importance to one hike in, in macroeconomic terms. Nonetheless, you know, we need—we need to get to a place where we’re confident that we have a stance that will bring inflation down to 2 percent over time. That’s what we need to get to, and we’ve been—you know, we’ve been moving toward it. As we’ve gotten closer to it, we’ve slowed the pace at which we’ve moved. I think that was appropriate. And now that we’re getting closer, we, we— again, we have the ability to proceed carefully.","Q&A","Press Conf","","202","2023-09"
"2023-09-20","So I, I guess I would point more to—rather than pointing to a sense of inflation having become more persistent, I wouldn’t think—that’s not—we’ve, we’ve seen if, if I had to attribute one thing—again, we’re, we’re picking medians here and trying to attribute one explanation. But I think, broadly, stronger economic activity means, means rates— we have to do more with rates, and that’s what—that’s what that meaning is, is telling you. In terms of, of what the neutral rate can be—you know, we—we know it by its works. We only know it by its works, really. We can’t—we can’t—you know, the, the models and, and—that we use, you—ultimately, you only know when you get there and by, by the way the economy reacts. And, again, that’s another reason why we’re—why we’re moving carefully now, because, you know, there are lags here. So it, it may—it may, of course, be that the—that the neutral rate has risen. You do see people—you don’t see the median moving—but you do see people raising their estimates of, of the neutral rate, and it’s certainly plausible that the neutral rate is higher than, than the longer-run rate. Remember—what we write down in the SEP is the longer-run rate. It is certainly possible that, you know, that the—that the neutral rate at this moment is higher than that, and that—that’s part of the explanation for why the economy has been more resilient than, than expected.","Q&A","Press Conf","","240","2023-09"
"2023-09-20","Yes, of course. It is a—it is a good thing that we, we’ve seen now meaningful rebalancing in the labor market without an increase in unemployment, and that’s, that’s because we’re seeing that rebalancing in other places—in, for example, job openings and in the jobs–worker gap. You’re also seeing supply-side things—so, so that’s happening. I would say, though, we still—I still think, and I think, broadly, people still think, that there will have to be some softening in the labor market that can come through more supply, as we’ve seen as well. Also, remember, the natural rate, we think, is, is coming down, which is a supply-side thing, so that the, the gap between any given unemployment rate that’s lower than that and the natural rate comes down. That’s a way for supply—that’s a way for the labor market to achieve a better balance. So all of those things are happening. You’re right—in, in the median forecast, we don’t see a big increase in unemployment. We do see an increase, and—but that’s—that really is just “playing forward” the trends that we’ve been seeing. That is not guaranteed. There, there may come a time when unemployment goes up more than that, but that’s, that’s really what we’ve been seeing is, progress without higher unemployment for now.","Q&A","Press Conf","","215","2023-09"
"2023-09-20","No, no—I would not do that. I, I would just say—what, what would I say about that? I’ve always thought that the soft landing was, was a plausible outcome—that there was a path, really, to, to a soft landing. I’ve thought that, and I’ve said that since we lifted off. It’s also possible that, that the path has narrowed, and it’s widened, apparently. Ultimately, a position to, to move carefully again. That—we, we will restore price stability. We, we know that we have to do that, and we know the public depends on us doing that, and we know that we have to do it so that we can achieve the kind of labor market that we all want to achieve, which is an extended period—sustained period of strong labor market conditions that benefit all. We know that. The fact that we’ve come this far lets us really proceed carefully, as I keep saying. So I think, you know, that’s, that’s the end we’re trying to achieve. I wouldn’t want to handicap the likelihood of it, though. It’s not up to me to do that.","Q&A","Press Conf","","185","2023-09"
"2023-09-20","Yeah. So the proposal at the meeting was to—was to maintain our current policy stance, and, and I think there was obviously unanimous support for that. But this, of course, is an SEP meeting, and so people write down what they think. And you’ve got—you have some—you saw, I think—seven wrote down no hike at this—at this meeting—or between that—people just stating their positions—and, really, what, what people are saying is, “Let’s see how the data come in.” You know, we, we want to see—you know what we want to see. We want to see that, that this, this—these good inflation readings that we’ve been seeing for the last three months—we want to see that it’s more than just three months, right? We want to see, you know—the, the labor market report that we received, the last one that we received, was a good example of what we do—of what we do want to see. It was a combination of, of, you know, of—across a broad range of indicators, continuing rebalancing of the labor market. So those are the two things—so those are our two mandate variables, and, and that’s, that’s the progress that we want to see. But I think people—they want to be convinced, you know—they want to be careful to—not to jump to a conclusion, really, one way or the other—but just be convinced that the data, you know, support that conclusion. And that’s why, given how far we’ve come and how quickly we’ve come, we’re actually in a position to be able to proceed carefully as we assess the incoming data and the evolving outlooks and risks and make these decisions meeting by meeting.","Q&A","Press Conf","","278","2023-09"

"2023-11-01","So it’s, it’s—the fact is the Committee is not thinking about rate cuts right now at all. We’re not talking about rate cuts. We’re still very focused on the first question, which is, have we achieved a stance of monetary policy that’s sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation down to 2 percent over time sustainably? That is the question we’re focusing on. The next question, as you know, will be, for how long will we remain restrictive? Will policy remain restrictive? And what we’ve said there is that we’ll keep policy restrictive until we’re confident that inflation is on a sustainable path down to 2 percent. That’ll be the next question, but honestly, right now we’re really tightly focused on the first question. The question of rate cuts just doesn’t come up because I think the first—it’s so important to get that first question, you know, as close to right as you can. there was a tightening bias in the Committee. You say in the statement you’re looking to assess the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the extent to which you may need to hike additionally. You didn’t say earlier that you were sufficiently restrictive. There were forecasts for two rate hikes among most members of the Committee. But then you just said that, you know, we don’t—we haven’t made a determination.

I mean, it would be hard to see how you would do that if you look at the—look at the activity we’ve seen recently, which is not really indicative of a recession in the near term. In terms of how to think about translation into rate hikes, I think it’s just too early to be doing that, and the main reason is we just don’t know how persistent this will be. You can see how volatile it is. Different kinds of news will affect the level of rates, and I think any kind of an estimate that was precise would hang out there and have a great chance of looking wrong very quickly.

We’re not confident that we haven’t; we’re not confident that we have.

"2023-11-01","Thanks for your question. So, I’ll talk about bond yields, but I want to take a second and just sort of set the broader context in which we’re looking at that. So, if you—if you look at the situation—let’s look at the economy first. Inflation has been coming down, but it’s still running well above our 2 percent target. The labor market has been rebalancing, but it’s still very tight by many measures. GDP growth has been strong, although many forecasters are forecasting, and they have been forecasting, that it will slow. that we have achieved such a stance. So that is the broader context into which this, this strong economy and all the things I said—that’s the context in which we’re looking at this question of rates. So, obviously we’re monitoring, we’re attentive to the increase in longer-term yields and—which have contributed to a tightening of broader financial conditions since the summer. As I mentioned, persistent changes in broader financial conditions can have implications for the path of monetary policy. In this case, the tighter financial conditions we’re seeing—[coming] from higher long-term rates, but also from other sources, like the stronger dollar and lower equity prices—could matter for future rate decisions, as long as two conditions are satisfied. The first is that the tighter conditions would need to be persistent. And that is something that remains to be seen. But that’s critical. Things are fluctuating back and forth—that’s not what we’re looking for. With financial conditions, we’re looking for persistent changes that are material. The second thing is that, that the longer-term rates that have moved up—they can’t simply be a reflection of, of expected policy moves from us that we would then—that if we didn’t follow through on them, then the rates would come back down. So, and I would say on that, it does not appear that an expectation of higher near-term policy rates is causing the increase in longer-term rates. So, in the meantime, though, perhaps the most important thing is that these higher Treasury yields are showing through to higher borrowing costs for households and businesses and those higher costs are going to weigh on economic activity to the extent this tightening persists and the mind’s eye goes to the 8 percent—near 8 percent mortgage rate,","Q&A","Press Conf","","381","2023-11"
"2023-11-01","Good afternoon, everyone. Welcome. My colleagues and I remain squarely focused on our dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people. We understand the hardship that high inflation is causing, and we remain strongly committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal. Price stability is the responsibility of the Federal Reserve. Without price stability, the economy does not work for anyone. In particular, without price stability, we will not achieve a sustained period of strong labor market conditions that benefit all. Since early last year, the FOMC has significantly tightened the stance of monetary policy. We have raised our policy interest rate by 5¼ percentage points and have continued to reduce our securities holdings at a brisk pace. The stance of policy is restrictive—meaning that tight policy is putting downward pressure on economic activity and inflation—and the full effects of our tightening have yet to be felt. Today, we decided to leave our policy interest rate unchanged and to continue to reduce our securities holdings. Given how far we have come, along with the uncertainties and risks we face, the Committee is proceeding carefully. We will make decisions about the extent of additional policy firming and how long policy will remain restrictive based on the totality of the incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. I’ll have more to say about monetary policy after briefly reviewing economic developments. Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has been expanding at a strong pace and well above earlier expectations. In the third quarter, real GDP is estimated to have risen at an outsized annual rate of 4.9 percent, boosted by a surge in consumer spending. After picking up somewhat over the summer, activity in the housing sector has flattened out and remains well The labor market remains tight, but supply and demand conditions continue to come into better balance. Over the past three months, payroll job gains averaged 266,000 jobs per month, a strong pace that is nevertheless below that seen earlier in the year. The unemployment rate remains low at 3.8 percent. Strong job creation has been accompanied by an increase in the supply of workers. The labor force participation rate has moved up since late last year, particularly for individuals aged 25 to 54 years, and immigration has rebounded to pre-pandemic levels. Nominal wage growth has shown some signs of easing, and job vacancies have declined so far this year. Although the jobs-to-workers gap has narrowed, labor demand still exceeds the supply of available workers. Inflation remains well above our longer-run goal of 2 percent. Total PCE prices rose 3.4 percent over the 12 months ending in September. Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 3.7 percent. Inflation has moderated since the middle of last year, and readings over the summer were quite favorable. But a few months of good data are only the beginning of what it will take to build confidence that inflation is moving down sustainably toward our goal. The process of getting inflation sustainably down to 2 percent has a long way to go. Despite elevated inflation, longer-term inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households, businesses, and forecastters, as well as measures from financial markets. The Fed’s monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people. My colleagues and I are acutely aware that high inflation imposes significant hardship as it erodes purchasing power, especially for strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent objective. As I noted earlier, since early last year, we have raised our policy rate by 5¼ percentage points, and we have decreased our securities holdings by more than $1 trillion. Our restrictive stance of monetary policy is putting downward pressure on economic activity and inflation. The Committee decided at today’s meeting to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 5¼ to 5½ percent and to continue the process of significantly reducing our securities holdings. We are committed to achieving a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation sustainably down to 2 percent over time, and to keeping policy restrictive until we are confident that inflation is on a path to that objective. We are attentive to recent data showing the resilience of economic growth and demand for labor. Evidence of growth persistently above potential, or that tightness in the labor market is no longer easing, could put further progress on inflation at risk and could warrant further tightening of monetary policy. Financial conditions have tightened significantly in recent months, driven by higher longer-term bond yields, among other factors. Because persistent changes in financial conditions can have implications for the path of monetary policy, we monitor financial developments closely. In light of the uncertainties and risks, and how far we have come, the Committee is proceeding carefully. We will continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting, based on the totality of the incoming data and their implications for the outlook for economic activity and inflation as well as the balance of risks. In determining the extent of additional policy firming affects economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial developments. We remain committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal and to keeping longer-term inflation expectations well anchored. Reducing inflation is likely to require a period of below-potential growth and some softening of labor market conditions. Restoring price stability is essential to set the stage for achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the longer run. To conclude: We understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission. We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum-employment and price-stability goals. Thank you, and","Opening Statement","Press Conf","","984","2023-11"
"2023-11-01","Well, I just—that’s, you know, the way our policy works is—and sometimes it works with lags, of course, which can be long and variable, but ultimately, if you raise interest rates, you do see those effects. And you see those effects in the economy now. You see what’s happening in the housing market. You’re seeing that now. You’ll see, if you look at surveys of people, it’s not a good time they think to buy durable goods of various kinds because rates are so high now. I mention again, we’re getting reports from housing that the effects of this—of this could be quite significant. But you’re right. This has been a resilient economy. And it’s, I think, been surprising in its resilience. And there are a number of possible reasons why that may be. Our job is to—is to achieve maximum employment and price stability, and so we take the economy as it comes. It has been resilient, so we just—we take it as it is.","Q&A","Press Conf","","166","2023-11"
"2023-11-01","Well, I think everyone has been very gratified to see that we’ve been able to achieve, you know, pretty significant progress on inflation without seeing the kind of increase in unemployment that has been very typical of rate hiking cycles like this one. So that’s, that’s a historically unusual and very welcome result. And the same is true of growth. You know, we’ve been saying that we need to see below-potential growth. And growth has been strong, but yet we’re still seeing this. I think I still believe, and my colleagues for the most part I think still believe, that is likely to be true. It is still likely to be true—not a certainty—but likely that we will need to see some slower growth and some softening in the labor market—in labor market conditions to get, you know, to fully restore price stability. So—but it’s only a good which is the unwinding of the distortions to both supply and demand [that arose] from the pandemic and the response to the pandemic. And the other is, is, you know, restrictive monetary policy, which is moderating demand and giving the supply side time to recover—time and space to recover. So you see those two forces now working together to bring down inflation. But it’s that first one can bring down inflation without the need for higher unemployment or slower growth, it’s just—it’s supply—you know, supply-side improvements like shortages and bottlenecks and that kind of thing going away. It’s getting, you know, a significant increase in the size of the labor market now, both from labor force participation and from immigration. That’s a big supply-side, you know, gain that is really helping the economy, and it’s part of why—part of why GDP is so high is because we’re getting that supply. So, we welcome that. But I think those things will run their course, and we’re probably still going to be left—we think, and I think—we’ll still be left with some ground to cover to get back to full price stability. And that’s where monetary policy and what we do with demand is still going to be important.","Q&A","Press Conf","","355","2023-11"
"2023-11-01","I mean, I don’t know that I want to just accept anybody’s characterization, but I’ll tell you how we’re doing this. So, we’re going meeting by meeting. We’re asking ourselves whether we’ve achieved a stance of policy that is sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation down to 2 percent over time. That’s the question we’re asking. We’re looking at the full range of economic data, including financial conditions and all of those things that we look at, and then we’re, we’re—you know, we’ve, we’ve come very far with this rate hiking cycle, very far. And you saw the spread at the September meeting of—you know, it’s a relatively small spread of—people think one or two additional hikes. So you’re close to the—to the end of the cycle. That’s—that was an impression as of, I believe, as of September. It’s not a promise or a plan of the future. And so we’re going into these meetings one by one. We’re looking at the data. As I mentioned, we’re also—we’re being careful. We’re proceeding carefully because we can proceed carefully at this time. Monetary policy is restrictive. We see its effects, particularly in interest-sensitive spending and other channels. So that’s how I think about it.","Q&A","Press Conf","","202","2023-11"
"2023-11-01","Well so, let’s talk about the dot plot first. So the dot plot is a picture in time of what the people in the Committee think is likely to be appropriate monetary policy in light of their own personal economic forecast. In principle, when things change, it’s not—that’s not, like, planned that anybody’s agreed to or that we will do. That’s a forecast that would change, for example—I mean, many things could change that would cause people to say, “I period between that meeting and the next meeting. But, nonetheless, it’s out there. We don’t— we do personally update our forecast, but we don’t formally update the dot plot. So, you know, I think we try to be as transparent as we can about the way we’re thinking about these things. We’re laying out there our thinking, and, you know, as we approach the meeting, we’ll all be— my colleagues and I will be talking about how we’re processing that data. In terms of—so we’re not really changing the way—in terms of growth, what I said was “below potential.” So what you have here recently is growth that is—that is temporarily— potential growth is elevated for a year or two right now over its trend level. So the right way to think about it is, what’s potential growth this year? People think trend growth over a long period of time is a little bit less than 2 percent, or I would say just around 2 percent. But what we’ve had is, with the—with the, you know, improvement in the size of the labor force, as I mentioned, through both participation and immigration, and with the, the, you know, the better functioning in the labor market and with the—with the, you know, the unwinding of the supply chain and shortages and those kinds of things, you’re seeing actually elevated potential growth. There’s catch-up growth that can happen in potential. And that means that if you’re growing—you could be growing at 2 percent this year and still be growing below the increase in the potential output of the economy. I hope that’s clear. That’s really what’s going on. That’s why I would say it as below potential.","Q&A","Press Conf","","365","2023-11"
"2023-11-01","Banking stress—so it’s something we’re watching.

And so we’ve been working a lot with financial institutions to make sure that they have good funding plans and good—and that they have a plan for how to deal with the kind of portfolio, unrealized, losses that they have. And we do think the banking system is quite resilient. We had, you know, a handful of bank failures but—so that’s, that’s what we’re out there doing. And we don’t have any reason to think that this—that these rate hikes are materially changing that picture, which is one of a strong banking system and one where there’s a strong focus by banks and by supervisors on liquidity, on funding, and those sorts of things.","Q&A","Press Conf","","149","2023-11"

What else can we really do? It’s a 90-day comment period, and we typically don’t comment on these things once they’re out for—out for comment. And we do hope that stakeholders—and we know that they will use this opportunity to express their views. They haven’t been shy about that. So that’s, that’s critical and that’s, that’s what I can say about that now.","Q&A","Press Conf","","115","2023-11"
"2023-11-01","That’s always the question we’re asking ourselves. And we know that, if we fail to restore price stability, the risk is that expectations of higher inflation get entrenched in the economy, and we know that that’s really bad for people. Inflation will be both more—both higher and more volatile. That’s a—that’s a prescription for misery, and, and so we’re really committed to not letting that happen. You know, for the first year or so of our tightening cycle, the risk was all on the side of not doing enough. We’re, you know, we’re— we’ve come far enough that, that the risks, you know, have gotten more two sided. You can’t identify that with a lot of precision, but it does feel like the, the risks are more two sided now. And—but we’re committed to getting inflation back down to our target over time, and we will.","Q&A","Press Conf","","146","2023-11"
"2023-11-01","Good question. We haven’t really—we haven’t really been thinking about that yet. We—you know, it’s November 1, and that’s a decision we’ll be making in the first quarter of next year.","Q&A","Press Conf","","31","2023-11"
"2023-11-01","Yeah. We look at a range of, of things. I think the, the, the, you know, the UM thing got blown out of proportion a little bit. It was actually a preliminary estimate that got revised away. And I said it was preliminary in it, but that didn’t get picked up. So we look at many, many things. So really, look across the broad array of surveys and also market-based estimates, and, you know, we do that really carefully at every meeting and between meetings. And, you know, there’s—it’s just clear that inflation expectations are in a good place. The public does believe that inflation will get back down to 2 percent over time,. And it will— they’re right. So—and there’s no real crack in that—in that armor. You can always find one reading that is a little bit out of whack, but, honestly, the bulk of them are just very clear that the public believes that inflation will come down. And that’s, of course—we believe that’s critical in winning the battle.","Q&A","Press Conf","","172","2023-11"
"2023-11-01","Yeah. So first thing to say is that it’s very important. It’s a very important variable in, in the way we think about monetary policy, but you can’t identify it with any precision in real time. And we know that. So you have to just take that—you have to take your estimate of it with a grain of salt. What we know now is, you know, within a range of estimates of the neutral rate policy, is restrictive, and it’s therefore putting downward pressure on economic activity, hiring, and inflation. So we do—we do talk about this. There’s not any debate or attempt to, you know, to sort of agree as a group on what—whether r* has moved or not. Some people think it has, some people haven’t said—that don’t think it has. Ultimately, it’s unknowable, and so really again, what we’re focused on is, you know, looking at the data and giving ourselves a little more time now to look carefully at the data by being careful in our moves. Does it—does it feel like monetary policy is restrictive enough to bring inflation down to 2 percent over time? That’s the question we’re asking ourselves. I think, you know, years from now economists will be revising their estimates of r* as it existed on November 1, 2023. You can’t—we can’t really wait for that in making policy. We have to look—we have to have those models and look at them and think about them, and, ultimately, we’ve got to look at the effects that policy is having, accounting for the lags, which makes it difficult. current level could be—could risk pushing up overall inflation or re-acceleration?","Q&A","Press Conf","","277","2023-11"
"2023-11-01","So, if you look at the—look at the broad range of wages, they have— wage increases have really come down significantly over the course of the last 18 months to a level where they’re substantially closer to that level that would be consistent with 2 percent inflation over time, making standard assumptions about productivity over time. So it’s much closer than it was. And that’s true of the ECI, which is the one that’s—the one that we got this week. It’s true of average hourly earnings and compensation per hour, too. So—and all of them are kind of saying that, which is great. And you have to look at a group of them because any one of them can be idiosyncratic from—in any given reading. So that’s what you see. And so what you saw with the ECI reading was, if you look back a couple—it comes out four times a year—if you look back a couple of quarters, you’ll see it was much higher, then it came down substantially in June. And then the September reading was more or less at the same level as the June reading. So, in a way, it’s just validating that decline, and it was very close to our expectations internally, too. So I think we feel good about that. Also I would say it isn’t—in my thinking, it’s not the case that, that wages have been the principal driver of inflation so far, although I think it’s all—I do think it’s fair to say that, as we go forward, as monetary policy becomes more important relative to the supply-side issues I’ve talked about in the unwinding of the pandemic effects, it may be that the labor market becomes more important over time, too.","Q&A","Press Conf","","290","2023-11"
"2023-11-01","So, as I mentioned, I think for much of the last year and a half, the concern was not doing too, too—not doing enough. It was not getting rates high enough in time to avoid having inflation expectations—higher inflation expectations become entrenched. So that was the concern. I think we’ve reached, you know, now more than 18 months into this. You can see by the fact that we have slowed down, although we’re still—we’re still—we’re still trying to gain confidence in what the appropriate stance is. But you can see that. We think, and I think, that the risks are getting more balanced. I’ll just say that they’re getting more balanced. The risk of doing too much versus the risk of doing too little are getting—are getting more— closer to balance, because policy is I think clearly restrictive at 5¼ to 5½ percent. That range, if you take off a mainstream estimate of the expected inflation, take one year inflation, you’re going to see that. You’re going to see a real policy rate that is well above mainstream estimates of a neutral policy rate. Now that’s arithmetic. It doesn’t really—the proof is really in how the economy reacts, but I would say that we’re in a place where those risks are getting closer to being in balance.","Q&A","Press Conf","","217","2023-11"
"2023-11-01","Well, I think what we’re looking at is are we still—is inflation still broadly cooling? Do we—is it sort of validating the path we saw over the summer, where inflation was clearly cooling and coming down. Now we’ve seen periods like that before, and they’ve just—there hasn’t been follow-through. The data have bounced back. So what are we demand, partly through just much more supply coming online. And with labor demand still clearly remaining very strong—when you have the kind of job growth we’ve had over the last quarter, it’s still very strong demand. So—and you see wage increases coming down as we discussed but coming down in a kind of gradual way. I think that’s—we want to see that, that whole set of processes continue.","Q&A","Press Conf","","126","2023-11"
"2023-11-01","You know, I continue to think it’s very hard to say. So it’s been one year at this meeting—one year ago, this was the fourth of our 75 basis points hikes. So that’s a full year since then. I think we are seeing the effects of, of all the hiking we did last year and this year—we’re seeing it. It’s very hard to know exactly what that might be. But you can, for are little things like that where the effects have just taken time to get into the economy. So I don’t—I think we have to make monetary policy under great uncertainty about how long the lags are. I think trying to make a clear—get a clear answer and say, “I’m just going to assume this is really not a good way to do it.” And this is one of the reasons why we have slowed the process down this year, was to give monetary policy time to get into the economy. And it takes time. We know that, and you can’t rush it. So, doing—slowing down is giving us, I think, a better sense of, of how much more we need to do, if we need to do more.","Q&A","Press Conf","","201","2023-11"
"2023-11-01","You know, the, the progress is probably going to come in lumps and be bumpy, but we’re making progress. You know, I think the core PCE [inflation rate] came down by almost 60 basis points in the third quarter. So the best thing I could point you to would be the September SEP where, you know, the expectation was that, that inflation by the end of way inflation comes down. It does take some time, and as you get—you know, as you get further and further from those highs, it may actually take longer time. But the good news is, you know, we’re making progress and monetary policy is restrictive. And we feel like we’re on a path to make more progress, and it’s essential that we do.","Q&A","Press Conf","","128","2023-11"

"2023-11-01","I wouldn’t say there’s been a structural change in consumption. I would say it’s certainly been strong. And so a couple of things. We may have underestimated the balance sheet strength of households and small businesses, and that may be part of it. There may be—you know, we’ve been, like everyone else, trying to estimate the number—the amount of savings that households have from the pandemic when they couldn’t spend on services really at all, or in-person services. And, you know, there can still be more of that than we think, although at a certain point we have to—we’re going to be getting back to pre-pandemic levels of savings. We may not be there yet. So things are—clearly, people are still spending. The dynamic has been really strong job creation with now wages that are—that are higher than inflation, in the aggregate anyway, and that raises real disposable income, and that raises goods availability, automobile availability is better—or was better, I think it still is. And, from a business standpoint, there are more people to hire. And it is more labor supply. So the whole thing has led to more growth, more spending, and that kind of thing. And it’s been—you know, it’s been good, and the thing is, we’ve been achieving progress on inflation in the middle of this. So, it’s been a dynamic. The question is, how long can that continue? And, you know, I just think this—the existence of this second set of factors at this time, which is the unwinding of the pandemic effects, that’s what makes this cycle unique, I think, and, you know, we’re still learning. That took longer for that process to begin than we thought, and we’re still learning about how it plays out. That’s all we can do.","Q&A","Press Conf","","297","2023-11"

"2023-12-13","Good afternoon. My colleagues and I remain squarely focused on our dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people. As we approach the end of the year, it’s natural to look back on the progress that has been made toward our dual-mandate objectives. Inflation has eased from its highs, and this has come without a significant increase in unemployment. That’s very good news. But inflation is still too high, ongoing progress in bringing it down is not assured, and the path forward is uncertain. As we look ahead to next year, I want to assure the American people that we’re fully committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent goal. Restoring price stability is essential to achieve a sustained period of strong labor market conditions that benefit all. Since early last year, the FOMC has significantly tightened the stance of monetary policy. We’ve raised our policy interest rate by 5¼ percentage points and have continued to reduce our securities holdings at a brisk pace. Our actions have moved our policy rate well into restrictive territory, meaning that tight policy is putting downward pressure on economic activity and inflation, and the full effects of our tightening likely have not yet been felt. Today, we decided to leave our policy interest rate unchanged and to continue to reduce our securities holdings. Given how far we have come, along with the uncertainties and risks that we face, the Committee is proceeding carefully. We will make decisions about the extent of any additional policy firming and how long policy will remain restrictive based on the totality of the incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. I will have more to say about monetary policy after briefly reviewing economic developments. Recent indicators suggest that growth of economic activity has slowed substantially from the outsized pace seen in the third quarter. Even so, GDP is on track to expand around the housing sector has flattened out and remains well below the levels of a year ago, largely reflecting higher mortgage rates. Higher interest rates also appear to be weighing on business fixed investment. In our Summary of Economic Projections (SEP), Committee participants revised up their assessments of GDP growth this year but expect growth to cool, with the median projection falling to 1.4 percent next year. The labor market remains tight, but supply and demand conditions continue to come into better balance. Over the past three months, payroll job gains averaged 204,000 jobs per month, a strong pace that is nevertheless below that seen earlier in the year. The unemployment rate remains low at 3.7 percent. Strong job creation has been accompanied by an increase in the supply of workers. The labor force participation rate has moved up since last year, particularly for individuals aged 25 to 54 years, and immigration has returned to pre-pandemic levels. Nominal wage growth appears to be easing, and job vacancies have declined. Although the jobs-to-workers gap has narrowed, labor demand still exceeds the supply of available workers. FOMC participants expect the rebalancing in the labor market to continue, easing upward pressures on inflation. The median unemployment rate projection in the SEP rises somewhat from 3.8 percent at the end of this year to 4.1 percent at the end of next year. Inflation has eased over the past year but remains above our longer-run goal of 2 percent. Based on the consumer price index and other data, we estimate that total PCE prices rose 2.6 percent over the 12 months ending in November and that, excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 3.1 percent. goal. Longer-term inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters, as well as measures from financial markets. As is evident from the SEP, we anticipate that the process of getting inflation all the way to 2 percent will take some time. The median projection in the SEP is 2.8 percent this year, falls to 2.4 percent next year, and reaches 2 percent in 2026. The Fed’s monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people. My colleagues and I are acutely aware that high inflation imposes significant hardship, as it erodes purchasing power, especially for those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation. We are highly, highly attentive to the risks that high inflation poses to both sides of our mandate, and we are strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent objective. As I noted earlier, since early last year, we have raised our policy rate by 5¼ percentage points, and we have decreased our securities holdings by more than $1 trillion. Our restrictive stance of monetary policy is putting downward pressure on economic activity and inflation. The Committee decided at today’s meeting to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 5¼ to 5½ percent and to continue the process of significantly reducing our securities holdings. While we believe that our policy rate is likely at or near its peak for this tightening cycle, the economy has surprised forecasters in many ways since the pandemic, and ongoing progress—sorry—ongoing progress toward our 2 percent inflation objective is not assured. We are prepared to tighten policy further if appropriate. We’re committed to achieving a stance of objective. In our SEP, FOMC participants wrote down their individual assessments of an appropriate path for the federal funds rate based on what each participant judges to be the most likely scenario going forward. While participants do not view it as likely to be appropriate to raise interest rates further, neither do they want to take the possibility off the table. If the economy evolves as projected, the median participant projects that the appropriate level of the federal funds rate will be 4.6 percent at the end of 2024, 3.6 percent at the end of 2025, and 2.9 percent at the end of 2026, still above the median longer-term rate. These projections are not a Committee decision or plan; if the economy does not evolve as projected, the path of policy will adjust as appropriate to foster our maximum-employment and price-stability goals. In light of the uncertainties and risks, and how far we have come, the Committee is proceeding carefully. We will continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting, based on the totality of the incoming data and their implications for the outlook for economic activity and inflation, as well as the balance of risks. In determining the extent of any additional policy firming that may be appropriate to return inflation to 2 percent over time, the Committee will take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial developments. We remain committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal and to keeping longer- term inflation expectations well anchored. Restoring price stability is essential to set the stage for achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the longer run. Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum-employment and price-stability goals. Thank you.","Opening Statement","Press Conf","","1205","2023-12"
"2023-12-13","So—specifically on “any”: We do say that “in determining the extent of any additional policy firming that may be appropriate,” so “any additional policy firming”—that sentence. So we added the word “any” as an acknowledgement that we believe that we are likely at or near the, the peak rate for this cycle. Participants didn’t write down additional hikes that we believe are likely, so that’s what we wrote down. But participants also didn’t want to take the possibility of further hikes off the table. So that’s really what we were thinking.","Q&A","Press Conf","","91","2023-12"
"2023-12-13","I think you can say that there’s little basis for thinking that the economy is in a recession now. I would say that. I think there’s, there’s always a probability that, that there will be a recession in the next year, and it’s a meaningful probability no matter what the economy is doing. So it’s always a real possibility. The question is, is it—so it’s a possibility here. I have always felt, since the beginning, that there was a possibility, because of the unusual situation, that the economy could cool off in a way that enabled inflation to come down without the kind of large job losses that have often been associated with high inflation and tightening cycles. So far, that’s what we’re seeing. That’s what many forecasters, on and off the Committee, are seeing. This result is not repeatedly through the post—in the post-pandemic period. Nonetheless, where we are is, is we see the things that I—that I mentioned.","Q&A","Press Conf","","160","2023-12"
"2023-12-13","So I think forecasters generally, if you go back a year, were very broadly forecasting a recession for this year, for 2023. And not only did that not happen—that includes Fed forecasters and really, essentially, all forecasters; a very high proportion of forecasters predicted very weak growth or a recession—not only did that not happen, we actually had a very strong year, and that was a combination of, of strong demand but also of real gains on the supply side. So this was the year when labor force participation picked up, where immigration picked up, where the distortions to supply and demand from the pandemic—you know, the shortages and the bottlenecks—really began to unwind. So we had significant supply-side gains with strong demand, and we got what looks like a 2½ percent-plus, or a little more than that, growth year at a time when potential growth this year might even have been higher than that, just because of the healing on the supply side. So that was a surprise to just about everybody. I think the inflation forecast is roughly, roughly what people wrote down a year ago, but in a very different setting. And I would say the labor market, because of the stronger growth, has also been significantly better. If you look back at the SEP from a year ago, there was a balance with the—with support from the supply side, a greater supply of labor. It’s a—you know, that’s, that’s what we see, and I think that combination was, was not anticipated broadly.","Q&A","Press Conf","","256","2023-12"
"2023-12-13","Nothing quite that mechanical is happening. The SEP really is, is a bottoms-up—built from the bottom up, right? So I think people are looking at what’s happening in the economy. And I think if you look at the big difference from September in the SEP, [it is that] the expectations for inflation this year, both headline and core, have come down, you know, really significantly in three months. That’s a big piece of, of this. At the same time, [real GDP] growth has turned out to be very strong in the third quarter. [Now it] is slowing, we believe, as, as appropriate. And we’ve got—we’ve had several labor market reports, which suggest, again, significant progress toward greater balance across a very—a broad range of indicators. You’re seeing so many of the indicators coming back to normal, not all of them. But so I think that people look at that, and they write down their—basically, each individual writes down a forecast and a rate forecast that goes with that forecast. We tabulate them and, and publish it. And so it’s not—it isn’t—you ask about real rates, I take it? conscious of, and aware of, and monitor, and it’s certainly a big part of—it’s a part of how we think about things. But, really, it’s broader financial conditions that matter. And, as you well know, it’s so hard to know exactly, you know, what the—what the real rate is or exactly how tight policy is at any given time. So you couldn’t follow that like it was a rule and think that you would get the right answer all the time, but it’s certainly something that we’re focused on. And, indeed, if you look at the projections, I think the expectation would be that the real rate is declining as we—as we move forward.","Q&A","Press Conf","","302","2023-12"
"2023-12-13","Yeah. No, we—we’re—we don’t think about political events. We don’t think about politics. We think about what’s the right thing to do for the economy. The minute we start thinking about those things—you know, we just can’t do that. We have to think, what’s the right thing? We’ll do the things that we think are right for the economy at the time we—when we think is the right time. That’s what we’ll always do. So I mentioned we’re moving carefully. One of the things we’re moving carefully about is that decision over—that assessment, really—over whether, whether we’ve done enough, really. And you see that people are not writing down rate hikes. That’s, that’s us thinking that we have done enough but not, not feeling that really strongly, confidently and not wanting to approaching things. And, and, you know, as I mentioned, we wrote down this SEP, and it talks about—people have individual assessments of when it will be appropriate to, you know, to start to dial back on, on the tight policy we have in place, and that’s a discussion we’ll be having going forward. But that’s another assessment that we’re going to make very carefully, so as time goes forward.","Q&A","Press Conf","","201","2023-12"
"2023-12-13","So this last year has been remarkable for the, the sort of seesaw thing, the back-and-forth we’ve had over the course of the year of markets moving away and moving back and that kind of thing. So, and what I would just say is that we, we focus on what we have to do and how we need to use our tools to achieve our goals, and that’s what we really focus on. And people are going to have different forecasts about the economy, and they’re going to—those are going to show up in market conditions, or they won’t, you know. But in any case, we have to do what we think is right. And, you know, in the long run, it’s important that financial conditions become aligned or are aligned with what we’re trying to accomplish, and, in the long run, they will be, of course, and, you know, I’m just focused on what’s the right thing for us to do. And my colleagues are focused on that, too.","Q&A","Press Conf","","170","2023-12"
"2023-12-13","Listen, I welcome the progress. I think it’s, it’s really good to see the progress that we’re making. I think if you look at the 12-month—look at the 6-month measures, you see very low numbers. If you look at 12-month measures, you’re still well above 2 percent. You’re actually above 3 percent on core, through November, PCE [inflation]. That isn’t to say— I’m not, you know, calling into question the progress. It’s great. We just need to see more. We need to see, you know, continued further, further progress toward getting back to 2 percent. That’s, that’s what we need to see. So, you know, our—it’s our job to restore price stability. And that—it’s one of our two jobs, along with maximum employment, and they’re equal. So we’re very focused on, on, you know, doing that. As I mentioned, we’re moving carefully at this point. We’re pleased with the progress, but, but we see the need for further progress, and I think—I think it’s fair to say there is a lot of uncertainty about going forward. We’ve seen the economy move in surprising directions, so we’re just going to need to see more further progress.","Q&A","Press Conf","","195","2023-12"
"2023-12-13","So we’ll, we’ll look at the totality of the data. Growth is one thing, so is inflation, so is labor market data. So we’d, we’d look at the totality. As we—as we make decisions about policy changes going forward, we’re going to be looking at all those things and, particularly, about the—as they affect the outlook. So it’s ultimately all about the outlook and the balance of risks as well. So that’s what—that’s what we’d be looking for. If we have stronger growth, you know, that’ll be good for people. That’ll be good for the labor market. It might actually mean that it takes a little longer to get inflation down to 2 percent. We will get it down to 2 percent, but, you know, if we see stronger growth, we’ll—we will set policy according to what we actually see. And, and so that’s how I would answer.","Q&A","Press Conf","","148","2023-12"
"2023-12-13","It’s only a problem inso—it’s not itself a problem. It’s only a problem insofar as it makes it more difficult for us to achieve our goals. And, you know, if you have—if you have growth that’s robust, what that will mean is probably it will keep the labor market very strong. It probably will, will place some upward pressure on inflation. That could mean that it takes longer to get to 2 percent inflation. That could mean we need to keep rates higher for longer. It could even mean, ultimately, that we would need to hike again. It just is— it’s the way, the way our policy works.","Q&A","Press Conf","","108","2023-12"
"2023-12-13","So on, on the better-balance side, there are just a lot of things. It’s— you see—you see job growth still strong but moving back down to more sustainable levels, given population growth and labor force participation. The things that are not quite—but let me go on with that list. You know, claims are low. If you look at surveys of businesses, they’re, they’re— sort of the era of this frantic labor shortage, [those kinds of worker shortages] are behind us, and they’re seeing a shortage of labor as being significantly alleviated. If you look at shortages of workers, whereas they thought job, job availability was the highest that it’d ever been or close to it, that’s now down to more normal levels by so many measures—participation, unemployment—so many measures: the unemployment—job openings, quits, all of those things. So wages are still running a bit above what would be consistent with 2 percent inflation over a long period of time. They’ve been gradually cooling off. But if wages are running around 4 percent, that’s still a bit above, I would say. And I guess there, there are just a couple of other—the unemployment rate is very, very low. And these are—but, but I would just say, overall, the development of the labor market has been very positive. It’s been a good time for workers to find jobs and get solid wage increases.","Q&A","Press Conf","","231","2023-12"
"2023-12-13","It may be. A common theme is that, while inflation is coming down, and that’s very good news, the price level is not coming down. Prices of some, some goods and services are coming down. But overall, in the aggregate, the price level is not. So people are still living with high prices, and that’s, that’s not—that is something that people don’t like. And, you know, so what will happen with that is, wages are now—[changes in] real wages are now positive. So [nominal] wages are now moving up more than inflation, as inflation comes down. And so that might help improve the mood of people. But we do see those—we see those public opinion surveys. The thing that we can do is to do our jobs, which is to use our tools to foster price stability, which has such great benefits over such long periods of time, and which is the thing that really enables us to work for and achieve an extended period of high employment, which is so beneficial for, you know, families and, and companies around the country.","Q&A","Press Conf","","182","2023-12"
"2023-12-13","You know, obviously, what we’ll do is we’ll look at the totality of the data, as I’ve mentioned a couple times, and, certainly, the labor data would be important in that. And, you know, if you—if you can describe a situation like that where if, if there were the beginning of a recession or something like that, then, yes, that would certainly weigh heavily on that decision.","Q&A","Press Conf","","67","2023-12"
"2023-12-13","So we’re, we’re aware of the risk that we would hang on too long. You know, we know that that’s a risk, and we’re very focused on not making that mistake. And we do regard the two—you know, we’ve come back into a better balance between the risk of overdoing it and the risk of underdoing it. Not only that, we were able to focus hard on the—on the price-stability mandate. And we’re getting back to the point where—which is what you do So I think we’ll be—we’ll be very much keeping that in mind, as we make policy going forward. And the things we’ll be looking at, I’ve already described. You know, we’re, we’re obviously looking hard at what’s happening with demand, and what we see? We see the same thing other people see, which is a strong economy, which really put up quite a performance in 2023. We see good evidence and good reason to believe that growth will come in lower next year. And you see what the forecasts are. I think the median growth—median participant wrote down 1.4 percent growth, but, you know, we’ll have to see. It’s very hard to predict. We’ll also be looking to see progress on inflation and, you know, the labor market remaining strong but, but ideally, without seeing the kind of large increase in unemployment that happens sometimes.","Q&A","Press Conf","","228","2023-12"
"2023-12-13","We haven’t typically tried to articulate, with one exception, really specific target levels, which was if you—some of you will remember the thresholds that we used in, I guess, 2013. I don’t—the answer is, these are things that we haven’t, you know, really worked out yet. We’re sort of just at the beginning of, of that discussion.","Q&A","Press Conf","","57","2023-12"
"2023-12-13","Well, that’s what we’re finding out, and we’ve, you know, we’ve seen real progress in, in core inflation. It has been sticky, and famously, the service sector is thought to be stickier, but we’ve actually seen reasonable progress in nonhousing services, which was the area where, where you would expect to see less progress. We are seeing some progress there, though. And, in fact, all three of the categories of core [prices] are now contributing: goods, housing services, nonhousing services. They’re all contributing in different—at different levels, you know, meeting by meeting—or, rather, report by report. So, yeah.","Q&A","Press Conf","","98","2023-12"
"2023-12-13","The question of whether there have been fundamental structural shifts is, is really hard to know the answer and a very interesting one right now. The one that would affect—the one that comes to mind, though, is just the question of where the neutral rate of interest is. And so, for example, if it’s risen, and I’m not saying that it has, but if it were to have risen, that would mean that, that interest rates would need to be a little bit higher to convey the same level of restriction. The thing is, we’re not really going to know that. You know, people will be writing papers about that 10 years from now and still fighting about it. So it’s just that it’s going to be uncertain. So we’re going to be making policy in this, you know, difficult, uncertain, really unprecedented environment. Some—someone once said that you know the—you know the natural rate of interest by its works, and that’s really right, but that’s very difficult because policy And, over the course of this year, we really slowed down a lot to give those lags time to work. In terms of demand, has demand shifted more away from services into goods? There’s— you can make a case for that, that the shift back into services has not been complete, and it doesn’t look like it’s ongoing, but I don’t know if that’s right. Maybe people just bought so much stuff that they temporarily don’t want any more stuff. They haven’t got anyplace to put it. [Laughter]","Q&A","Press Conf","","258","2023-12"
"2023-12-13","I mean, the reason you wouldn’t wait to get to 2 percent to cut rates is that policy would be, it would be too late. I mean, you’d want to be reducing restriction on the economy well before 2 percent because—or before you get to 2 percent so you don’t overshoot, if we think, think of restrictive policy as weighing on economic activity. You know, it takes—it takes a while for policy to get into the economy, affect economic activity, and affect inflation. So I can’t give you a precise answer. But if you look at what’s in the—in the SEP, and, you know, I think you’ll see a reasonable estimate of the time lags and things like that that it would take. point, because I would be able to look back then and probably find out that it turned out not to be right.

"2024-01-31","Good afternoon. My colleagues and I remain squarely focused on our dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people. The economy has made good progress toward our dual-mandate objectives. Inflation has eased from its highs without a significant increase in unemployment. That’s very good news. But inflation is still too high, ongoing progress in bringing it down is not assured, and the path forward is uncertain. I want to assure the American people that we’re fully committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent goal. Restoring price stability is essential to achieve a sustained period of strong labor market conditions that benefit all. Today, the FOMC decided to leave our policy interest rate unchanged and to continue to reduce our securities holdings. Over the past two years, we’ve significantly tightened the stance of monetary policy. Our strong actions have moved our policy rate well into restrictive territory, and we’ve been seeing the effects on economic activity and inflation. As labor market tightness has eased and progress on inflation has continued, the risks to achieving our employment and inflation goals are moving into better balance. I will have more to say about monetary policy— about monetary policy, after briefly reviewing economic developments. Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has been expanding at a solid pace. GDP growth in the fourth quarter of last year came in at 3.3 percent. For 2023 as a whole, GDP expanded at 3.1 percent, bolstered by strong consumer demand as well as improving supply conditions. Activity in the housing sector was subdued over the past year, largely reflecting high mortgage rates. High interest rates also appear to have been weighing on business fixed investment. pace that is well below that seen a year ago but still strong. The unemployment rate remains low at 3.7 percent. Strong job creation has been accompanied by an increase in the supply of workers. The labor force participation rate has moved up, on balance, over the past year, particularly for individuals aged 25 to 54 years, and immigration has returned to pre-pandemic levels. Nominal wage growth has been easing, and job vacancies have declined. Although the jobs-to-workers gap has narrowed, labor demand still exceeds the supply of available workers. Inflation has eased notably over the past year but remains above our longer-run goal of 2 percent. Total PCE prices rose 2.6 percent over the 12 months ending in December; excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 2.9 percent. The lower inflation readings over the second half of last year are welcome. But we will need to see continuing evidence to build confidence that inflation is moving down sustainably toward our goal. Longer- term inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters, as well as measures from financial markets. The Fed’s monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people. My colleagues and I are acutely aware that high inflation imposes significant hardship, as it erodes purchasing power, especially for those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation. We’re highly attentive to the risks that high inflation poses to both sides of our mandate, and we’re strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent objective. Over the past two years, we have raised our policy rate by 5¼ percentage points, and we’ve decreased our securities holdings by more than $1.3 trillion. Our restrictive stance of 5¼ to 5½ percent and to continue the process of significantly reducing our securities holdings. We believe that our policy rate is likely at its peak for this tightening cycle and that, if the economy evolves broadly as expected, it will likely be appropriate to begin dialing back policy restraint at some point this year. But the economy has surprised forecasters in many ways since the pandemic, and ongoing progress toward our 2 percent inflation objective is not assured. The economic outlook is uncertain, and we remain highly attentive to inflation risks. We’re prepared to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate for longer if appropriate. As labor market tightness has eased and progress on inflation has continued, the risks to achieving our employment and inflation goals are moving into better balance. We know that reducing policy restraint too soon or too much could result in a reversal of the progress we’ve seen on inflation and ultimately require even tighter policy to get inflation back to 2 percent. At the same time, reducing policy restraint too late or too little could unduly weaken economic activity and employment. In considering any adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will carefully assess the incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. The Committee does not expect that it will be appropriate to reduce the target range until it has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2 percent. We will continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting. We remain committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal and to keeping longer-run—longer-term inflation expectations well anchored. Restoring price stability is essential to set the stage for achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the longer run. Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum-employment and price-stability goals. Thank you. I look forward to our questions.","Opening Statement","Press Conf","","912","2024-01"
"2024-01-31","Sorry—say that last part again.","Q&A","Press Conf","","5","2024-01"
"2024-01-31","Okay. So, what are we looking for to get greater confidence? Let me say that we have confidence. We’re—we’re looking for greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably down to 2 percent. Implicitly, we do have confidence, and it has been increasing, but we want to get greater confidence. What do we want to see? We want to see more good data. It’s not that we’re looking for better data. It’s—we’re looking at continuation of the good data that we’ve been seeing, and a good example is inflation. So we have six months of good inflation data. The question really is, that six months of good inflation data—is it sending us a true signal that we are, in fact, on a path—a sustainable path down to 2 percent inflation? That’s the question. And the answer will come from some more data that’s also good That’s really what we’re thinking about. In terms of, of growth, we’ve had strong growth. I mean, if you take a step back, we’ve had strong growth—very strong growth [in real GDP] last year—going right into the fourth quarter. And yet we’ve had a very strong labor market, and we’ve had inflation coming down. So I think—whereas a year ago, we, we were thinking that we needed to see some softening in economic activity—that hasn’t been the case. So I think we, we look at—we look at stronger growth. We don’t look at it as a problem. I think, at this point, we want to see strong growth. We want to see a strong labor market. We’re not looking for a weaker labor market. We’re looking for inflation to continue to come down, as it has been coming down for the last six months.","Q&A","Press Conf","","288","2024-01"
"2024-01-31","No, I think it’s—I, I would say it, it seems—it seems to be the likely case that, that we will achieve that confidence, but we have to achieve it, and we haven’t yet. And so—I mean, it’s a good story. We have six months of good inflation [readings]. But you can—and you know this—you can look behind those numbers, and you can see that a lot of it’s been coming from goods inflation, for example, and goods inflation running significantly negative. It’s a reasonable assumption that, over time, goods inflation will flatten out—probably approximate zero. That would mean the services sectors would have to contribute more. So, in other words, what we care about is the aggregate number—not so much the composition. But us confidence that we’re on, on a path to—a sustainable path down to 2 percent inflation.","Q&A","Press Conf","","139","2024-01"
"2024-01-31","So, as you know, almost every participant on the Committee does believe that it will be appropriate to reduce rates and for, for—partly for the reasons that you say. You know, we, we feel like inflation is coming down. Growth has been strong. The labor market is strong. We’re—what we’re trying to do is identify a place where we’re really confident about inflation getting back down to 2 percent so that we can then begin the process of dialing back the restrictive level. So, overall, I think—I think people do believe—and, as you know, the median participant wrote down three rate cuts this year. But I think to get to that place where we feel comfortable starting the process, we need some confirmation that inflation is, in fact, coming down sustainably to 2 percent. variants. What would be the reasoning for holding rates higher than the levels recommended by those rules in the current instance?","Q&A","Press Conf","","155","2024-01"
"2024-01-31","The data available at the time of the January 30–31 meeting indicated that growth in U.S. real gross domestic product (GDP) was solid in the fourth quarter of 2023 but had stepped down from the third quarter's strong pace.","Staff Review of Economic Situation","Minutes","N/A","39","2024-01"
"2024-01-31","So we’re not—we’re not really at that stage. You know, we’re— we’re—there was no proposal to cut rates. Some people did, you know, talk about their view of the rate path. I would point you to the [December 2023] SEP as, as, you know, as good evidence of where people are, although it is—it is [now] one [FOMC meeting] cycle later. So, you know, we’re not—we’re not at a place of, of really working out those kinds of details, because we weren’t actively considering, you know, a—moving, moving the federal funds rate down. I will say, there is a—there is a wide disparity—a healthy disparity—of views, and you see that in public, public statements, in the minutes, and the transcripts when they’re released every five years. So we do have a healthy set of differences, and I think that’s actually essential for making good policy. We’re also able to reach agreement, generally, because we listen to each other—","Q&A","Press Conf","","158","2024-01"
"2024-01-31","sIn their discussions of monetary policy for this meeting, members agreed that economic activity had been expanding at a solid pace.","Committee Policy Action","Minutes","N/A","21","2024-01"
"2024-01-31","Job gains had moderated since early last year but remained strong, and the unemployment rate had remained low.","Committee Policy Action","Minutes","N/A","18","2024-01"
"2024-01-31","I’m not so worried about that. You know, it’s—again, we’ve had inflation come down without a slow economy and without, you know, important increases in, in unemployment, and there’s no reason why we should want to get in the way of that process, if it’s going to continue. So I, I am—you know, I think—I think declining inflation—continued declines in inflation are, are really the main thing we’re looking at. Of course, we want the labor market to remain strong, too. We don’t have a growth mandate. We’ve got a, a maximum-employment mandate and a, a price-stability mandate, and those are the two things we look at. Growth only matters to the extent it influences our achievement of those two—of those two mandates. Thank you very much.","Q&A","Press Conf","","127","2024-01"
"2024-01-31","Well, yes. I’m, I’m a big believer that—yes. So we, we do meet with outside groups who come from all different parts of the economy. And I always feel like you—I mean, I spent most of my life in the private sector looking at companies—individual companies—individual management teams—and then building out from that. And so, starting with GDP data is—and working into what’s actually affecting people’s lives is—is challenging. It’s very hard. So I, I really like anecdotal data. In addition, as you know, the 12 Reserve Banks have really the best network of anyone. In all their Districts, they’re talking to, you know, not just the business community, but the educational, medical, all, all—you know, nonprofit community. They have arms into all of that. And so when they come back—that’s what goes into the Beige Book. But they come back, and what each Reserve Bank president does is, during the outlook go-around, they’ll say, “In my District","Q&A","Press Conf","","158","2024-01"
"2024-01-31","Yeah, so it’s been—it’s been interesting that confidence surveys have been weak, at a time when unemployment has been low—very low, historically low—for a couple of years. And—but, nonetheless, that’s been the case. And we’ve asked ourselves why that is. And, you know, one obvious answer—we don’t pretend to have perfect wisdom on this—is—but one obvious answer is that the price level is high. So prices went up much more than 2 percent for year—per year for a couple of years. And people are going to the store, and they’re paying much more for the basics of life than they were two years ago—three years ago. And they’re not happy about it. And it’s fine that inflation is coming down, but the price—the prices they’re paying are still high. So that, that is what—that, that has to be some part of why people are unhappy. And they’re, they’re right to be unhappy. You know, this is why we need to keep price stability. It’s why we need to do our jobs—so that people don’t have to deal with things like this. In terms of [surveys]—you’re right. In, in recent, recent surveys, a couple of—you’ve seen a couple of significant increases in, in consumer confidence or, or happiness with the economy. I guess that’s a good thing. That can—that can support spending—can support economic activity. There’s some evidence of that. But it is—it is a fact that we have seen, you know, a meaningful increase. I think levels of confidence are still maybe not as high as they’ve been at various times. But it’s—they certainly have come up.","Q&A","Press Conf","","267","2024-01"
"2024-01-31","Well, I think if we—if we came to the view that, that inflation were—that the six-month inflation numbers, which are very close to 2 [percent], were, in “PCE world”—if we came to—if that’s—if we thought that is really where we’re going to be, then, yes, our policy would be in a different place. It would. But, you know, that’s the whole point is, we’re trying to get comfortable and gain confidence that that is where—that inflation is on a sustainable path down to 2 percent or toward 2 percent.","Q&A","Press Conf","","89","2024-01"
"2024-01-31","I don’t have a stance on that. It’s not something I’m focused on. [We’re] focused on doing our jobs. We have—this year is going to be a highly consequential year for, for the Fed and for monetary policy. And we’re, all of us, very buckled down, focused on doing our jobs.","Q&A","Press Conf","","51","2024-01"
"2024-01-31","I’m, I’m not in a position to put a number on it. I’m just going to say—and it’s not that we don’t have any confidence. We, we have growing confidence, but not to the point where we—where we feel like—it’s a highly consequential decision to start the process of, of dialing back on restriction. And we want to get that right, and we feel like the strong economy, strong labor market, inflation coming down—it gives us the ability to do that. We think that’s the best way we can serve the public, because, ultimately, we, we’ve made a lot of progress on inflation. We just want to make sure that we do get the job done in a sustainable way. That’s how we’re thinking about it. In terms of when that’ll be, you know, that, that’ll all come out of our communications, and, you know, we won’t—we won’t keep that a secret.","Q&A","Press Conf","","152","2024-01"
"2024-01-31","Yes, we do—we see those as independent tools. And so they don’t—for example, if you’re—if you’re normalizing policy, you might be reducing rates but continuing to run off the balance sheet. In both cases, that’s normalization, but from a strict monetary policy standpoint, you could say we’re loosening along with tightening. So that, that could happen. It’s not something we’re planning or thinking about, but right now, we’re thinking about getting to a place where—we’re going to see the balance sheet runoff to continue. We’re watching it carefully, and, as I said, we’ll—we’ll be looking into that as a Committee starting in March.","Q&A","Press Conf","","103","2024-01"
"2024-01-31","Yes. So I would start by saying that balance sheet runoff so far has gone very well. And as the process has continued, you know, we’re getting to that time where questions are beginning to come into greater focus about the pace of runoff and all that. So at this meeting, we did have some discussion of the balance sheet, and we’re planning to begin in- depth discussions of balance sheet issues at our next meeting in March. So those, those questions are all coming into scope now, and we’re focusing on them. But we’re, we’re at the beginning of that process, I would say.","Q&A","Press Conf","","105","2024-01"
"2024-01-31","My response is what I started with, which is that our, our job—the job Congress has given us is price stability and maximum employment. Price stability is absolutely essential for people’s lives, most importantly for—well, not most importantly—most, mostly for people at the lower end of the income spectrum who are living at the edges—at the margins. And so someone—for someone like that, high inflation in the—in the necessities of life—right away, you’re in trouble, whereas even middle-class people have some, you know, some scope to absorb higher costs. So we have to get—it’s our job. It’s what society has asked","Q&A","Press Conf","","101","2024-01"
"2024-01-31","So when we think about, you know—our, our statutory goals are maximum employment and price stability, and that’s what we’re targeting. We’re not targeting housing price inflation, the cost of housing, or any of those things. Those are very important housing, housing industry was helped more than any other industry. And when we raise rates, the housing industry can be hurt, because it’s a very interest-sensitive sector. On top of that, we have longer-run problems with the availability of housing. You know, we have a, a built-up set of cities, and, and, you know, people are moving further and further out. So there’s—there hasn’t been enough housing built. And these are not—these are not things that we have any tools to address. But, you know, where it comes into play very specifically in our work is inflation, which is a combination. It’s, it’s really rental inflation. You’re taking owners’ equivalent rent and then actual rent paid by tenants. And you’re, you’re running that through the CPI calculation. Or the PCE [inflation] calculation—the one we look at. And what that’s telling you is that market rents are increasing at a much lower rate or even being flat and that that will show up in inflation over time. It has to as long as that remains the case.","Q&A","Press Conf","","216","2024-01"
"2024-01-31","That’s one way to look at it. Yeah.","Q&A","Press Conf","","8","2024-01"
"2024-01-31","Well, I—look, I think, as you know, we consult the range of Taylor rules and, and non-Taylor kind of rules. We consult them regularly. They’re in our, our Tealbook, and, and they’re in all the materials that we look at. But, you know, I don’t think we’ve ever been at a—at a place where we were—where we were setting policy by them. And there—depending on the rule, it will tell you different things. There are many different formulations. Another way to think about it is, implicitly, is—so, in theory, of course, real rates go up if—holding all else equal—as inflation comes down. But that doesn’t mean we can mechanically adjust policy as real rates—sorry—as inflation comes down. It doesn’t mean that at all, because, for one thing, we, we don’t know—we, we look at more than just the fed funds rate. We look at—broadly—financial conditions. But, in addition, we don’t know with great confidence where the neutral rate of interest is at any given time. But that also doesn’t mean that we wait around for—to see, you know, the economy turn down, because that would be too late. So we’re really in a risk-management mode: of managing the risk—as I mentioned in my opening remarks—managing the risk that we move too soon and move too late. And I think to move, which is—which is where almost everyone on the Committee is—is in favor of, of moving rates down this year—but the timing of that is going to be linked to our gaining confidence that inflation is on a sustainable path down to 2 percent.","Q&A","Press Conf","","264","2024-01"
"2024-01-31","So this is a really interesting question. And I think—my, my own view is—I think if you look, look back to the pandemic, you, you saw a spike in productivity as workers were laid off, and, and activity didn’t decline as fast. And then you saw a deep trough will be, what, what is it that has changed the—you know, the productivity tends to be based on, you know, fundamental aspects of our economy. Is there—is there a case—will it be the case that we come out of this more productive on a sustained basis? And I don’t know. I don’t know. What would it take? It would take—you know, people talk about AI, but I would—my guess is that we may shake out and be back where we were, because I don’t—I’m not sure I see—work from home doesn’t seem like it’s a big productivity increase. Or AI, artificial intelligence— generative it may be, but probably not in the short run—probably, maybe in the longer run. So I’m not—I’m not seeing why it would, but, you know, right—you know, right now I would say that productivity is kind of what falls out of the, the broader forces that are driving people in and out of the labor force and, and activity returning and supply chains getting fixed.","Q&A","Press Conf","","218","2024-01"
"2024-01-31","So we—the thing is, we’re not looking for inflation to tap the 2 percent base once. We’re looking for it to settle out over time at 2 percent. And the same thing is true if we have a month or two of lower—and we have that now—of, of inflation that’s annualized at a—at a lower level—that wouldn’t be good. We’re not—you know, we’re not looking to have inflation anchor below 2 percent. We’re looking to have it anchor at 2 percent. the job on inflation while keeping the labor market strong.","Q&A","Press Conf","","91","2024-01"
"2024-01-31","We’ll just have to see. Yeah. We’ll—we look at those. Last year was a—was a, a surprise.","Q&A","Press Conf","","17","2024-01"
"2024-01-31","No, I think that that is a risk—the risk that inflation would, would reaccelerate. I think the, the greater risk is that it would—that it would stabilize at a level meaningfully above 2 percent. That’s, that’s, to me, more likely. Of course, if—if inflation were to surprise by moving back up, that would—we would have to respond to that, and that would— more likely risk is the one that I mentioned, which is, you’ve had six good months—very good months—but what, what’s really going to “shake out” here? You know, where—what will— when we look back, what will we see? Will, will inflation have dipped and then come back up? Are the last six months flattered by factors that are—that are one-off factors that won’t repeat themselves? We don’t think so. We don’t—you know, that’s not what we think, but that’s the question we are asking. We have to ask [that], and we want to get comfort on that.","Q&A","Press Conf","","159","2024-01"
"2024-01-31","I think the, the labor market is—it—I don’t know if I’d—it’s rebalancing. Clearly, that the—there was a fairly severe imbalance between demand for workers and supply at the beginning of the pandemic. So we lost several million workers at the beginning of the pandemic from people dropping out of the labor force. And then when the economy reopened—you remember 2021—you had a severe labor shortage, and it was just—it didn’t. And 2022 was a disappointing year, and, you know, we were kind of thinking, “Well, maybe we won’t get it back.” And then 2023, we did, as you know—so labor force participation came back strongly in ’23, and so did immigration. Immigration came to a halt during the pandemic. So—and so those two forces have significantly lowered the temperature in the labor market to what is still a very strong labor market. It’s still a good labor market for wages and for finding a job, but it’s getting back into balance, and that’s what we want to see. And, you know, one great way to look at that is what’s happening with, with wage increases. And you see it now across the, the major things that we—that we track. It isn’t every quarter, but, overall, there’s a clear trend—still at high levels, but back down to where—what would be consistent with, with where we were before the pandemic and with 2 percent inflation.","Q&A","Press Conf","","233","2024-01"
"2024-01-31","I, I think the labor market by many measures is at or nearing normal—but not totally back to normal. And you pointed to one or more of them. So I think, you know, job openings are not quite back to where they were. Wages—wage increases, rather, are not quite back to where they—to where they would need to be in the longer run. I, I would look at it this way, though. The, the economy is broadly normalizing, and so is the labor market. And that process will probably take some time. So wage setting is something that happens—it’s, it’s—you know, probably will take a couple of years to get all the way back. And that’s okay. That’s okay. But we do see—you saw today’s ECI reading—you know, the evidence is that, that wage increases are still at a healthy level—very healthy level—but they’re gradually moving back to levels that would be more associated—given, given assumptions about productivity, are more typically associated with 2 percent inflation. It’s, it’s an ongoing process—a healthy one— and, and, you know, I think we’re, we’re moving in the right direction.","Q&A","Press Conf","","186","2024-01"
"2024-01-31","It’s—so I think it’s, it’s—of course, you know that it’s not something you can identify with any precision. But if you—a standard approach would be to take the nominal rate—5.3 percent, let’s say—and subtract sort of a, a forward measure of inflation. If you do that—and there are many, many ways to calculate the neutral rate—but that’s one I like to do. And, you know, you’re going to get to something that is materially above mainstream estimates of neutrality—of the neutral rate—you will. And—but at the same time, you look at the economy, and you say, “This is an economy that grew 3.1 percent last year.” And, and you say, “What does that tell you about the neutral rate?” What’s happening, though, is, the supply side has been recovering in the middle of this. So that, that won’t go on forever. So a lot of the growth we’re seeing is not—is—it isn’t just a tug of war between, between interest rates and demand. You’re getting, you know, more activity because of the—of labor market healing and supply chains healing. So I think the question is, when that peters out, I think the, the, you know, the, the restriction will show up probably more, more sharply.","Q&A","Press Conf","","205","2024-01"
"2024-01-31","So it’s—I think you, you do see in the interest-sensitive parts of the economy—you do see, for example, housing. You see the effects. You do. Your, your second question, though, really, I think, is important, and that is, a lot of this has come through—a lot of the disinflationary process has come through the healing of supply chains and also of the labor market. So you’ve seen the—you know, that other set of factors is really different from other really do think that we’re having an effect broadly across the economy. I would point to the interest-sensitive parts of the economy as well as spending, generally. But it’s a—it’s a joint story. It’s a complicated story.","Q&A","Press Conf","","116","2024-01"
"2024-01-31","No, I wouldn’t—I wouldn’t say we’ve achieved that. And I, I think we have—we have a ways to go. Inflation is still—you know, core inflation is still well above target on a 12-month basis. Twelve months is our, our target, certainly. I’m encouraged, and we’re encouraged by the progress. But, you know, we’re, we’re not—we’re not declaring victory at all at this point. We think we have a ways to go.","Q&A","Press Conf","","71","2024-01"
"2024-01-31","Yeah. Well, so we’re not—you know, it’s not the pandemic, so we can actually rely on more, more traditional forms. People are working. They’re getting wages, and, and the economy has largely reopened and is broadly normalizing, as you see. So I wouldn’t say we’re looking at that, that sort of more innovative data as much. You know, you point to rents. So, of course, we follow the, the components of inflation very carefully. Which would be: Goods inflation—I talked about that a little bit; you mentioned housing inflation. So the question is, when will these lower market rents find their way into measured rents, as measured, measured in PCE inflation? And we think that’s coming, and we know it’s coming. It’s just a question of when and, and how big it’ll be. So—but that’s in, in everyone’s forecast, I would say. So that will—that will help. But at the same time, we think goods inflation will probably—it’s been giving a lot of disinflation to the effort—and probably that declines over time, but it may well have some, some still a tailwind. We’ll find out with, with that. So we look at the things that relate to our mandate very carefully, and—as you would imagine.","Q&A","Press Conf","","205","2024-01"

"2024-01-31","So I’ll point you to that language on your first question. We, we included that language in the statement to signal clearly that—with strong growth, strong labor market, inflation coming down—the Committee intends to move carefully as we consider when to begin to dial back the restrictive stance that we have in place. So if you take that to the current context—current context, we’re going to be data dependent. We’re going to be looking at this meeting by meeting. Based on the meeting today, I would tell you that I don’t think it’s likely that the Committee will reach a level of confidence by the time of the March meeting to identify March as the time to do that. But that’s, that’s to be seen. So I wouldn’t call—you know, when you say—when you ask me about “in the near term,” I’m hearing that as March. I would say I don’t think that’s—that’s, that’s probably not the most likely case or what we would call the base case. And your second question is—","Q&A","Press Conf","","173","2024-01"
"2024-01-31","Yeah, I, I don’t know that we’ve worked out the particulars— statement language and that kind of thing. I would just say, if you look at—you know, look at where, where 12-month inflation is, and it’s, you know, it’s still well above—core is 2.9 percent, for example—12-month—which is way down from where it was. Very, very positive development—very fast decline—and, and, you know, the, the case is likely that it will continue to come down. So, so that’s where—that’s where it is. But we’re, you know, we’re wanting to see, you know, more data.","Q&A","Press Conf","","94","2024-01"
"2024-03-20","Yeah. So we make decisions meeting by meeting. And we didn’t make any decisions about future meetings today.

"2024-03-20","We’ll take—you know, things can happen during an intermeeting period, if you look back—unexpected things. So I don’t want to—I wouldn’t want to dismiss anything. So I just would say that the Committee wants to see more data that gives us higher confidence that inflation is moving down sustainably toward 2 percent. I also mentioned—and we don’t see this in the data right now, but if there were a significant weakening in the data, particularly in the labor market, that could also be a reason for us to begin the process of meeting.","Q&A","Press Conf","","93","2024-03"
"2024-03-20","Well, we’ll just have to see how the data come in. We would, of course, love to get great inflation data. We got really good inflation data on the second—in the second part of last year. Again, we didn’t overreact to it. We said we needed to see more, and we said it would be bumpy. And now we have January and February, which I’ve talked about a couple of times. So, you know, we’re looking for more good data, and we would certainly welcome it. Thank you.","Q&A","Press Conf","","88","2024-03"
"2024-03-20","So let me say my main message at that—in those two days of hearings was really that the Committee needs to see more evidence to build our confidence that inflation is moving down sustainably toward our 2 percent goal, and we don’t expect that it will be appropriate to begin to reduce rates until we’re more confident that that is the case. I said that any number of times, so those were kind of the main part of the message. We repeated that today in our statement. I also—to the language you mentioned, I, I really pointed out that we had made significant progress over the past year, and what we’re looking for now is confirmation that that progress will continue. We had a series of inflation readings over the second half of last year that were really much lower. We didn’t overreact, as I mentioned. But that’s what I had in mind.","Q&A","Press Conf","","153","2024-03"
"2024-03-20","I generally think—I mean, this movement actually started 30 years ago—30 years ago, when some academics posited that a more transparent central bank, if the public understands your reaction function, the markets will do your work for you. They’ll react to the data. And so it all happens that way and so there’s been a march toward greater and greater transparency. And that—certainly Chairman Bernanke advanced that, Chairman Greenspan did, Chair Yellen did, and I. You know, so we went from four press conferences a year to eight, so now every meeting really is “live” now. I think that’s a good innovation. I wouldn’t want to turn it back. We also have done a bunch of other things. You know, we have an annual supervision report, Financial Stability Report. I mean, there’s a long list of things that we’ve done. I think you—I mean, nothing comes to mind as really desperately in need of doing at this moment. We’re very transparent. We have no shortage of FOMC participants speaking to the public through the media. And so that channel is full, I would say. So I think it’s generally broadly helped and made things better. But not every day and in every way.","Q&A","Press Conf","","203","2024-03"
"2024-03-20","Sure. So I think we’ve been pretty transparent on this, but I will— I’ll try harder. So we are not getting ready to—we haven’t proposed—we haven’t come to a conclusion that we should propose, or anything like that, that Congress consider legislation to authorize a digital dollar. And it would take legislation by Congress signed by the President to give us the ability to do what we think of as a CBDC, which is really a retail CBDC with the public. So we’re just a long, long way from that. What we are doing, and I think what every major central bank is doing, is we’re trying to stay in the frontiers of what’s going on in digital finance, and it has many, many different areas. It has applications in wholesale finance, in the payment system, and so we need—to serve the public—these issues have become very front burner in the last five or six years—we need to be knowledgeable about all that. So we actually do have people trying to understand things that are—but it’s wrong to say that we’re working on a CBDC and that we’ve secretly got a lab here where we’ve got one, and we’re just going to spring it on Congress at the right moment. We don’t. I haven’t at all, in my own mind, made a decision that I think this is something the","Q&A","Press Conf","","230","2024-03"
"2024-03-20","I guess I’d put it this way: The—if you look at the incoming inflation data that we’ve had for January and February, I think very broadly that suggests that we were right to wait until we’re more confident. So I think, I think—I didn’t hear anyone dismissing it as not information that we should look at or anything like that. So I think, generally speaking, it does go in the direction of saying, yes, it’s appropriate for us to be careful as we approach this question.","Q&A","Press Conf","","86","2024-03"
"2024-03-20","Wages is one thing. We don’t—our target is not wages. It’s really inflation. But we would look to the fact that wages are still coming in very strong. But, but we want. We don’t think that—the inflation was not originally caused—we think, I don’t think, by mostly by wages. That wasn’t really the story. But we do think that, to get inflation back down to 2 percent sustainably, we’d like to see, you know, continuing gradual movement of wage increases at still high levels but back down to levels that are more sustainable over time.","Q&A","Press Conf","","95","2024-03"
"2024-03-20","Sure. So we’re—most importantly, we’re looking at the incoming inflation data and the contents of it and what they’re telling us, so that’ll be—and also the various components—so obviously that’s what we want. We want more confidence that inflation is coming down sustainably toward 2 percent. And, I mean, of course we’ll also be looking at all the other things that are happening in the economy. We’ll look at the totality of the data, including everything essentially as we make that assessment. But the most important thing will be the inflation data coming in.","Q&A","Press Conf","","94","2024-03"
"2024-03-20","So it’s sort of ironic that, by going slower, you can get farther. But that’s the idea. The idea is that, with a smoother transition, you won’t—you’ll run much less risk of kind of liquidity problems, which can grow into shocks, and which can cause you to stop the process prematurely. So that’s—in terms of how it ends, we’re going to be monitoring carefully money market conditions and asking ourselves whether they—what they’re telling us about reserves. Are they—right now, we would characterize them as “abundant,” and what we’re aiming for is “ample” and, you know, which is a little bit less than abundant. So there isn’t a— you know, there’s not a dollar amount or a percent of GDP or anything like that where we think we have a really pretty clear understanding of that. We’re going to be looking at what these— what’s happening in money markets, in particular—a bunch of different indicators, including the ones I mentioned, to tell us when we’re getting close. Then, though, you reach a point ultimately where you stop allowing the balance sheet to run off and you—but then, from that point, there’s another period in which nonreserves—nonreserve liabilities grow organically, like currency, and that also shrinks the reserves at a very slow pace. So you have a, you know, a slower pace of runoff, which we’ll have fairly soon. Then you have another time where you effectively hold the above what we think the lowest possible ample number would be. We’re not trying for that. We want to have a cushion, a buffer, because we know that demand for reserves can be very volatile. And we don’t want to, again, find ourselves in a situation where there aren’t reserves, and we have to turn around and buy assets and put reserves back in the banking system the way we did in 2019 and ’20.","Q&A","Press Conf","","313","2024-03"
"2024-03-20","Well, I think we broadly think that, once [take-up at] the overnight [reverse] repo [facility] stabilizes, either at zero or close to zero, that, as the balance sheet","Q&A","Press Conf","","28","2024-03"
"2024-03-20","You know, we’ll be watching carefully. But one of the reasons we’re slowing down—we will soon enough, fairly soon I should say, slow down—is that we want to avoid any, any kind of that turbulence. I wasn’t thinking particularly about the banking- sector turbulence, but we—and we had some indicators the last time. This is our second time in doing this, and I think we’re going to be paying a lot of attention to the things that started to happen and that foreshadowed what eventually happened at the end of that tightening cycle where we wound up in a short[-of-]reserves situation. And we don’t want to do that again. And I think now we have a better sense of what are the indicators. It isn’t—it wasn’t so much in the banking system as it was around, for example, where federal funds are trading relative to the administered rates and where secured rates are relative to the administered rates. Those sorts of things. We will always be watching the banking system for similar signs, though.","Q&A","Press Conf","","174","2024-03"
"2024-03-20","It’s more—I would put it more in the context of what I said in our— in my opening remarks that the risks are really two-sided here. We—we’re in a situation where, you know, if we ease—if we ease too much or too soon, we could see inflation come back, and if we ease too late, we could do unnecessary harm to employment and people’s working lives. And so, you know, we do see the risks as two-sided, so it is consequential. We want to be careful. And, fortunately, with the economy growing, with the labor market strong, and with inflation coming down, we can approach that question carefully and let the data speak on that. That’s really what I was thinking.","Q&A","Press Conf","","121","2024-03"
"2024-03-20","So that—our, our longer-run goal is to return to a balance sheet that is mostly Treasuries. I do expect that, once we’re through this, we’ll come back to the other issues about the composition and the maturity and revisit those issues, but it’s, you know, not","Q&A","Press Conf","","46","2024-03"
"2024-03-20","So we, of course, monitor—it’s one of our two goal variables. We all monitor the labor market very, very carefully. And I don’t see those cracks today. And I, you know—we follow all the possible stories that are out there about, about there being cracks, but the overall picture really is a strong labor market. The extreme imbalances that we saw in the gradually moderating down to more sustainable levels. In many, many respects, the things are returning more to their state in 2019, which we can think of as normal for this purpose. That’s job openings and quits. And surveys of workers and businesses are always interesting on this: You know, how tight is the—how easy is it to find a job? How hard is it—how easy it is to find a worker? Those have both—those surveys have both come down. So the labor market is—it’s in good shape. You know, you do see things like the low— the low hiring rate, and people have made the argument that if, if layoffs were to increase, that would—that would mean that the net would be fairly quick increases in unemployment. So that’s something we’re watching, but we’re not seeing it. Of course, initial claims are very, very low and, if anything, have tracked down a little bit. So—watching it carefully. Don’t see it. And when I say something—I, I use the term “unexpected” weakening of the labor market. So, you know, we do expect the unemployment rate to—the forecast is that it would move up, I think, closer to what we see as the longer-run sustainable level. That’s just—that’s just people’s forecast, individual forecasts. But we’re talking about something that’s unexpected. That’s where I’ll leave it, though.","Q&A","Press Conf","","287","2024-03"
"2024-03-20","We’re a very consensus-oriented organization, and we do try to achieve consensus and, ideally, unanimity. People do dissent. It’s something that happens. Life goes on, and it’s not a problem. We’ve always had dissents. But—and so I—you know, you respect thoughtful dissents very much. It’s like, you may not agree with some arguments, but you really want to understand them. So you may read a book that takes a position that you have long opposed, just to understand [the position of] that book. So I treat dissents with real respect as well.","Q&A","Press Conf","","92","2024-03"
"2024-03-20","We receive these letters with respect, and we write careful responses and address concerns. We listen, again, because we’re talking to the people who, in our system of government, have oversight over our activity. So that’s—but at the end of the day, we take that on board, but we have to make our judgments, and we have to “stick to our knitting”— which is maximum employment, price stability, supervise and regulate the banks, work on the payment system: the things that we do.","Q&A","Press Conf","","83","2024-03"
"2024-03-20","It certainly hasn’t improved our confidence—it hasn’t raised anyone’s confidence. But I would say that the story is really essentially the same and that is of inflation coming down gradually toward 2 percent on a sometimes-bumpy path, as I mentioned. I think that’s what you still see. We’ve got nine months of 2½ percent inflation now, and we’ve had two months of kind of bumpy inflation. We were saying that we’ll—it’s going to be a bumpy ride. We consistently said that. Now here are some bumps, and the question is, are they more than bumps? And we just don’t—we can’t know that. That’s why we are approaching this question carefully. It is very important for everyone that we serve that we do get inflation sustainably down. And I think the historical record, it’s—every situation is different, but the historical record is that you need to approach that question carefully and try to get it right the first time and not have to come back and raise rates again perhaps if you cut inappropriately— prematurely.","Q&A","Press Conf","","174","2024-03"
"2024-03-20","So I see the Committee looking at the two months of data and asking the same question you’re asking and saying we’re just going to have to see what the data show. As I mentioned, you can look at January, which is a very high reading and you can—and I think many people did see the possibility of seasonal adjustment problems there. But, again, you don’t want to—you’ve got to be careful about dismissing the parts of the data that you don’t like. So then February wasn’t, wasn’t as high, but it was higher. So the question is, what are we going to see? You know, we tend to see a little bit stronger—this is in the data—a little bit stronger inflation in the first half of the year, a little bit less strong later in the year. We’re going to— we’re going to let the data show. I don’t think we really know whether this is a bump on the road or something more. We’ll have to find out. In the meantime, the economy is strong, the labor market is strong, inflation has come way down, and that gives us the ability to approach this question carefully and feel more confident that inflation is moving down sustainably at 2 percent when we take that step to begin dialing back our restrictive policy. dented that confidence at all?","Q&A","Press Conf","","228","2024-03"
"2024-03-20","So we think—there are many different financial conditions indicators, and you can kind of, you know, see different answers to that question. But, ultimately, we do think that financial conditions are weighing on economic activity, and we think you see that in—a great place to see it is in the labor market, where you’ve seen demand cooling off a little bit from the extremely high levels. And there I would point to job openings, quits, surveys, the hiring rate. Things like that are really demand. There are also supply-side things happening, but I think those are demand-side things happening. You know, we saw—that’s been a question for a while. We did see progress on inflation last year—significant progress, despite financial conditions sometimes being tighter, sometimes looser. give us more color on how the Committee is thinking about inflation dynamics now? What we’ve seen at the beginning of the year, are they more one-off increases that will fade, or is there more of a secular turn with goods prices rising again and service prices staying sticky? And also housing prices have been sort of the Godot of this cycle, in that you keep expecting them to go down, and they don’t. How does the Committee see this playing out forward, since you’ve raised your inflation forecast?","Q&A","Press Conf","","215","2024-03"
"2024-03-20","No, not all by itself. No. I mean, we saw—you saw last year very strong hiring and inflation coming down quickly. We now have a better sense that a big part of that was supply-side healing, particularly with, with growth in the labor force. So, in and of itself, strong job growth is not a reason, you know, for us to be concerned about inflation.","Q&A","Press Conf","","65","2024-03"
"2024-03-20","Yeah. So, so, if what we’re getting is a lot of supply and a lot of demand, and that supply is actually feeding demand because workers are getting paid and they’re spending and that’s, you know—what you would have is potentially kind of what you had last last year with—both with supply chains and also with, with growth in the size of the labor force.","Q&A","Press Conf","","65","2024-03"
"2024-03-20","I, you know, I think, if you look at the SEP, what it says is that it is still likely in most people’s view that we will achieve that confidence and that there will be rate cuts. But that’s really going to depend on the incoming data. It is. The other thing is, in the second half of the year, you have some pretty low readings, so it might be harder to make progress as you move that 12-month window forward. Nonetheless, we’re looking for data that confirm the kind of low readings that we had last year and give us a higher degree of confidence that what we saw was really inflation moving sustainably down to 2 percent—toward 2 percent.","Q&A","Press Conf","","121","2024-03"
"2024-03-20","I think that that higher year-end number reflects the data we’ve seen so far this year because you’re now—you’re now in this year. So I think that—sorry, say your last part of your question again.","Q&A","Press Conf","","35","2024-03"
"2024-03-20","So you’re right. They’re pretty modest changes, but you’re right. There was an uptick in the longer-run rate, and also there’s a 25 basis point increase in ’25 and ’26. In terms of, are rates going to be higher in the longer run, if that’s really your question, I don’t think we know that. I think it’s, it’s—we think that rates were generally low during the pre-pandemic post–Global Financial Crisis era for reasons that are mostly, you know, important, slow-moving, large things like demographics and productivity and that sort of thing—things that don’t move quickly. But I don’t think we know. I mean, my instinct would be that rates will not go back down to the very low levels that we saw, where, all around the world, there were long- run [real interest] rates that were at or below zero in some cases. I don’t see rates going back down to that level. But I think there’s tremendous uncertainty around that.","Q&A","Press Conf","","161","2024-03"
"2024-03-20","So that is what we’re discussing essentially is—and we’re not discussing all the other many other balance sheet issues. We will discuss those in due course. But what we’re really looking at is slowing the pace of runoff. There isn't much runoff among MBS—in MBS right now, but there is in Treasuries. And we’re talking about going to a lower pace. I don’t want to give you a specific number because we haven’t made a—haven’t had an agreement or decision, but that’s the idea. And that’s what we’re looking at. In terms of the timing, I said fairly soon. I wouldn’t want to try to be more specific than that, but you get the idea. The idea is—and this is in our longer-run plans—that we may actually be able to get to a lower level, because we would avoid the kind of frictions that can happen. Liquidity is not evenly distributed in a system. And there can be times when, in the aggregate, reserves are ample or even abundant, but not in every part. And those parts where they’re not ample, there can be stress, and that can cause you to prematurely stop the process to avoid the stress. And then it would be very hard to restart, we think. So something like that happened in ’19 perhaps. So that’s what we’re doing. We’re looking at what would be a good time and what would be a good structure, and “fairly soon” is words that we use to mean fairly soon.","Q&A","Press Conf","","251","2024-03"
"2024-03-20","We will get aggregate inflation down to 2 percent over time. We will. And, and I would assume that we’ll continue to see is—we’ll see goods prices coming into a new equilibrium where they’re going down perhaps not as quickly as they had been earlier this year, where housing services inflation will come back down as, as current market rents are suggesting will happen and where nonhousing services will move back down. Some combination of those three things—and it may be different from the combination we had before the pandemic—will be achieved and will bring inflation back down to 2 percent sustainably.","Q&A","Press Conf","","102","2024-03"
"2024-03-20","I want to start by being—saying I always try to be careful about dismissing data that we don’t like. So you need to check yourself on that, and I’ll do that. But— so I would say the January number, which was very high—the January CPI and PCE numbers were quite high. There’s reason to think that there could be seasonal effects there. But, nonetheless, we don’t want to be completely dismissive of it. The February number was high, higher than expectations, but we have it at currently well below 30 basis points core PCE, which is not terribly high. So it’s not like the January number. But I take the two of them together, and I think they haven’t really changed the overall story, which is that of inflation moving down gradually on a sometimes-bumpy road toward 2 percent. I don’t think that story has changed. I the good inflation readings we got in the last seven months of last year. We didn’t take too much signal out of that. What you heard us saying was that we needed to see more that we could, you know—we wanted to be careful about that decision, and we’re not going to overreact, as well, to these two months of data, nor are we going to ignore them.","Q&A","Press Conf","","215","2024-03"
"2024-03-20","We’re strongly committed to bringing inflation down to 2 percent over time. That is—that is our goal, and we will achieve that goal. Markets believe we will achieve that goal. And they should believe that, because that’s what—that’s what will happen over time. But we stress “over time.” And so I think we’re, we’re making projections that do show that happening. And we’re committed to that outcome, and we will bring it about.","Q&A","Press Conf","","73","2024-03"
"2024-03-20","So I think there’s some confidence that the market rents—lower market rent increases that we’re seeing will show up in measures of housing services inflation over time. There’s a little bit of uncertainty about when that will happen, but there’s real confidence that they will show up eventually over time. But, again, uncertainty about the exact timing of that.","Q&A","Press Conf","","59","2024-03"

"2024-03-20","Good afternoon. My colleagues and I remain squarely focused on our dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people. The economy has made considerable progress toward our dual-mandate objectives. Inflation has eased substantially while the labor market has remained strong, and that is very good news. But inflation is still too high, ongoing progress in bringing it down is not assured, and the path forward is uncertain. We are fully committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent goal. Restoring price stability is essential to achieve a sustainably strong labor market that benefits all. Today, the FOMC decided to leave our policy interest rate unchanged and to continue to reduce our securities holdings. Our restrictive stance of monetary policy has been putting downward pressure on economic activity and inflation. As labor market tightness has eased and progress on inflation has continued, the risks to achieving our employment and inflation goals are moving into better balance. I will have more to say about monetary policy after briefly reviewing economic developments. Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has been expanding at a solid pace. GDP growth in the fourth quarter of last year came in at 3.2 percent. For 2023 as a whole, GDP expanded 3.1 percent, bolstered by strong consumer demand as well as improving supply conditions. Activity in the housing sector was subdued over the past year, largely reflecting high mortgage rates. High interest rates also appear to have weighed on business fixed investment. In our Summary of Economic Projections, Committee participants generally expect GDP growth to slow from last year’s pace, with a median projection of 2.1 percent this year and 2 percent over the next two years. Participants generally revised up their growth projections since December, reflecting the strength of incoming data, including data on labor supply. per month. The unemployment rate has edged up but remains low at 3.9 percent. Strong job creation has been accompanied by an increase in the supply of workers, reflecting increases in participation among individuals aged 25 to 54 years and a continued strong pace of immigration. Nominal wage growth has been easing, and job vacancies have declined. Although the jobs-to- workers gap has narrowed, labor demand still exceeds the supply of available workers. FOMC participants expect the rebalancing in the labor market to continue, easing upward pressure on inflation. The median unemployment rate projection in the SEP is 4.0 percent at the end of this year and 4.1 percent at the end of next year. Inflation has eased notably over the past year but remains above our longer-run goal of 2 percent. Estimates based on the consumer price index and other data indicate that total PCE prices rose 2.5 percent over the 12 months ending in February and that, excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 2.8 percent. Longer-term inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters as well as from measures from financial markets. The median projection in the SEP for total PCE inflation falls to 2.4 percent this year, 2.2 percent next year, and 2 percent in 2026. The Fed’s monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people. My colleagues and I are acutely aware that high inflation imposes significant hardship as it erodes purchasing power, especially for those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation. We are strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent objective. holdings. As labor market tightness has eased and progress on inflation has continued, the risks to achieving our employment and inflation goals are coming into better balance. We believe that our policy rate is likely at its peak for this tightening cycle and that, if the economy evolves broadly as expected, it will likely be appropriate to begin dialing back policy restraint at some point this year. The economic outlook is uncertain, however, and we remain highly attentive to inflation risks. We are prepared to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate for longer, if appropriate. We know that reducing policy restraint too soon or too much could result in a reversal of the progress we have seen on inflation and ultimately require even tighter policy to get inflation back to 2 percent. At the same time, reducing policy restraint too late or too little could unduly weaken economic activity and employment. In considering any adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. The Committee does not expect it will be appropriate to reduce the target range until it has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably down toward 2 percent. Of course, we’re committed to both sides of our dual mandate, and an unexpected weakening in the labor market could also warrant a policy response. We will continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting. In our SEP, FOMC participants wrote down their individual assessments of an appropriate path for the federal funds rate based on what each participant judges to be the most likely scenario going forward. If the economy evolves as projected, the median participant projects that the appropriate level of the federal funds rate will be 4.6 percent at the end of this economy does not evolve as projected, the path for policy will adjust as appropriate to foster our maximum-employment and price-stability goals. Turning to our balance sheet, our securities holdings have declined by nearly $1.5 trillion since the Committee began reducing our portfolio. At this meeting, we discussed issues related to slowing the pace of decline in our securities holdings. While we did not make any decisions today on this, the general sense of the Committee is that it will be appropriate to slow the pace of runoff fairly soon, consistent with the plans we previously issued. The decision to slow the pace of runoff does not mean that our balance sheet will ultimately shrink by less than it would otherwise but rather allows us to approach that ultimate level more gradually. In particular, slowing the pace of runoff will help ensure a smooth transition, reducing the possibility that money markets experience stress and thereby facilitating the ongoing decline in our securities holdings consistent with reaching the appropriate level of ample reserves. We remain committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal and to keeping our longer-term inflation expectations well anchored. Restoring price stability is essential to set the stage for achieving maximum employment and price stability over the long term. To conclude: We understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission. We, at the Fed, will do everything we can to achieve our maximum-employment and price-stability goals. Thank you.","Opening Statement","Press Conf","","1162","2024-03"

And the inflation data came in a little bit higher is a separate matter, and I think that caused people to write up their inflation.

We haven’t made any decisions on, on policy or on process at all. Nothing. Nothing. No decisions have been made.

"2024-05-01","You know, I said “an unexpected weakening” is what I—the way I characterized it. So, you know—and I’m not going to try to define exactly what I mean by that. But, you know, it would be—it would have to be meaningful and get our attention and lead us to broader—it would be a broader thing that would—that would suggest that it would be appropriate to consider cutting. I think whether you decide to cut will depend on all the facts and circumstances, not just that one.","Q&A","Press Conf","","86","2024-05"
"2024-05-01","So that—you’re right. I think that, that may happen, and, you know that we all serve domestic mandates, right? So I think the difference between the United States and other countries that are now considering rate cuts is that they’re just not having the kind of growth we’re having. They have—their inflation is performing about like ours or maybe a little better, but they’re not experiencing the kind of growth we’re experiencing. So we actually have the luxury of having strong growth and a strong labor market, very low unemployment, high job creation, and all of that, and we can be patient. And we will—we’ll be careful and cautious as we approach the decision to cut rates, whereas I think other jurisdictions may go before that. In terms of the implications, you know, I think obviously markets see it coming. It’s priced in now. And so I think the markets and economies can adapt to it. And I think, you know, we haven’t seen—in addition, for the emerging market economies, we haven’t seen the kind of turmoil that was more frequent 20 years ago, 30 years ago. And that’s, I think, partly because emerging market countries, many of them have much better monetary policy frameworks, much more credibility on inflation. And so they’re navigating this pretty well this time.","Q&A","Press Conf","","219","2024-05"
"2024-05-01","Yes. I mean, I think—I think that restrictive monetary policy is doing what it’s supposed to do, and it’s—but it’s also, in this case unusually, working alongside and with the healing of the supply side. This, this—what was different this time was that a big part of the source of the inflation and the reason why we’re having this conversation is that we had this supply-side kind of collapse, with shortages and bottlenecks and all that kind of thing. And so—and this was to do with the shutting down and reopening of the economy and other things that, that really raised demand. So, many factors did that. So I think now you see those two things working together, the reversal of those supply and demand distortions from the pandemic and the response to it, along with restrictive monetary policy. Those two things are working to bring down inflation, and we’ve made a lot of progress. Let’s remember how far we’ve come. And we have a ways to go. We’ve got work left to do, but we’re not looking at the very high inflation rates that we were seeing two years ago.","Q&A","Press Conf","","191","2024-05"

If you’re a person who’s living paycheck to paycheck, and suddenly all the things you buy—the fundamentals of life—go up in price, you, you are in trouble right away. And so, with those people in mind, in particular, what we’re doing is, we’re using our tools to bring down inflation. It will take some time, but we will succeed. And we will bring inflation back down to 2 percent, and then people won’t have to worry about it again. That’s what we’re doing, and we know that it’s painful and inconvenient.

So yeah, I mean, it’s—that part of it is bumpy. And, again, we don’t target wage increases, but, you know, in the longer run, if you have—if you have wage increases running higher than productivity would warrant, then, you know, there will be inflationary pressures. Employers will raise prices over time if that’s the case. So we’ve seen progress. It has been inconsistent, but we have seen a substantial decline overall.

"2024-05-01","So we’re, we’re always going to do what we think the right thing for the economy is when we come to that consensus view that it’s the right thing to do for the economy. That’s our record. That’s what we do. We’re not looking at anything else. You know, it’s hard enough to get the economics right here. These are difficult things, and if, if we were to take on a whole, another, set of factors and use that as a new filter, it would reduce the likelihood we’d actually get the economics right. So that’s how we think about it around here. And, you know, we’re at peace over it. We know that we’ll do what we think is the right thing, when we think it’s the right thing. And we’ll all do that. And that’s, that’s how everybody around here thinks. So I can’t say it enough, that we just don’t—we just don’t go down that road. If you go down that road, where do you stop? And, and so we’re not on that road. We’re on the road","Q&A","Press Conf","","181","2024-05"
"2024-05-01","Good afternoon. My colleagues and I remain squarely focused on our dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people. The economy has made considerable progress toward our dual-mandate objectives. Inflation has eased substantially over the past year, while the labor market has remained strong. And that’s very good news. But inflation is still too high, further progress in bringing it down is not assured, and the path forward is uncertain. We are fully committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent goal. Restoring price stability is essential to achieve a sustainably strong labor market that benefits all. Today, the FOMC decided to leave our policy interest rate unchanged and to continue to reduce our securities holdings, though at a slower pace. Our restrictive stance of monetary policy has been putting downward pressure on economic activity and inflation, and the risks to achieving our employment and inflation goals have moved toward better balance over the past year. However, in recent months, inflation has shown a lack of further progress toward our 2 percent objective, and we remain highly attentive to inflation risks. I’ll have more to say about monetary policy after briefly reviewing economic developments. Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a solid pace. Although GDP growth moderated from 3.4 percent in the fourth quarter of last year to 1.6 percent in the first quarter, private domestic final purchases—which excludes inventory investment, government spending and net exports, and usually sends a clearer signal on underlying demand—was 3.1 percent in the first quarter, as strong as the second half of 2023. Consumer spending has been robust over the past several quarters, even as high interest rates The labor market remains relatively tight, but supply and demand conditions have come into better balance. Payroll job gains averaged 276,000 jobs per month in the first quarter, while the unemployment rate remains low at 3.8 percent. Strong job creation over the past year has been accompanied by an increase in the supply of workers, reflecting increases in participation among individuals aged 25 to 54 years and a continued strong pace of immigration. Nominal wage growth has eased over the past year and the jobs-to-workers gap has narrowed, but labor demand still exceeds the supply of available workers. Inflation has eased notably over the past year but remains above our longer-run goal of 2 percent. Total PCE prices rose 2.7 percent over the 12 months ending in March; excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 2.8 percent. The inflation data received so far this year have been higher than expected. Although some measures of short-term inflation expectations have increased in recent months, longer-term inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters, as well as measures from financial markets. The Fed’s monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people. My colleagues and I are acutely aware that high inflation imposes significant hardship, as it erodes purchasing power, especially for those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation. We are strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent objective. The Committee decided at today’s meeting to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 5¼ to 5½ percent and to continue the process of significantly reducing our securities toward better balance. The economic outlook is uncertain, however, and we remain highly attentive to inflation risks. We’ve stated that we do not expect that it will be appropriate to reduce the target range for the federal funds rate until we have gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2 percent. So far this year, the data have not given us that greater confidence. In particular, and as I noted earlier, readings on inflation have come in above expectations. It is likely that gaining such greater confidence will take longer than previously expected. We are prepared to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate for as long as appropriate. We’re also prepared to respond to an unexpected weakening in the labor market. We know that reducing policy restraint too soon or too much could result in a reversal of the progress we’ve seen on inflation. At the same time, reducing policy restraint too late or too little could unduly weaken economic activity and employment. In considering any adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. Policy is well positioned to deal with the risks and uncertainties that we face in pursuing both sides of our dual mandate. We will continue to make decisions meeting by meeting. Turning to our balance sheet: The Committee decided at today’s meeting to slow the pace of decline in our securities holdings, consistent with the plans we released previously. Specifically, the cap on Treasury redemptions will be lowered from the current $60 billion per month to $25 billion per month as of June 1. Consistent with the Committee’s intention to hold primarily Treasury securities in the longer run, we’re leaving the cap on agency securities per month, total portfolio runoff will amount to roughly $40 billion per month. The decision to slow the pace of runoff does not mean that our balance sheet will ultimately shrink by less than it would otherwise but rather allows us to approach its ultimate level more gradually. In particular, slowing the pace of runoff will help ensure a smooth transition, reducing the possibility that money markets experience stress and thereby facilitating the ongoing decline in our securities holdings that are consistent with reaching the appropriate level of ample reserves. We remain committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal and to keeping longer-term inflation expectations well anchored. Restoring price stability is essential to set the stage for achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the longer run. To conclude: We understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission. We, at the Fed, will do everything we can to achieve our maximum-employment and price-stability goals. Thank you.","Opening Statement","Press Conf","","1053","2024-05"
"2024-05-01","So I do think the evidence shows, you know, pretty clearly that policy is restrictive and is weighing on demand, and there are a few places I would point to for that. You can start with the labor market. So demand is still strong—the demand side of the labor market, in particular—but it’s cooled from its extremely high level of a couple years ago, Indeed report and the JOLTS report. That’s, that’s demand cooling. The same is true of quits and hiring rates, which have essentially normalized. I also look at the—we look at surveys of workers and—pardon me—surveys of workers and businesses, and [they] ask workers, “Are jobs plentiful?” and ask businesses, “Are workers plentiful? Is it easy to find workers?” And you’ve seen that the answers to those have come back down to pre-pandemic levels. You also see in interest-sensitive spending, like housing and investment—you also see that higher interest rates are weighing on those activities. So I do think it’s clear that, that policy is restrictive.","Q&A","Press Conf","","169","2024-05"
"2024-05-01","So I would say that we believe it is restrictive, and we believe [that] over time it will be sufficiently restrictive. That will be a question that, that the data will have to answer.","Q&A","Press Conf","","34","2024-05"
"2024-05-01","So I think it’s unlikely that the next policy rate move will be a hike. I’d say it’s unlikely. You know, our policy focus is really what I just mentioned, which is— which is how long to keep policy restrictive. You ask, what would it take? You know, I think we’d need to see persuasive evidence that our policy stance is not sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation sustainably down to 2 percent over time. That’s not—that’s not what we think we’re seeing, as I—as I mentioned, but that’s—something like that is what it would take. We’d look at the totality of the data in answer to that question. That would include inflation, inflation expectations, and all the other data too.","Q&A","Press Conf","","120","2024-05"
"2024-05-01","Well, I think, again, the test—what I’m saying is, if we were to come to that conclusion that policy weren’t tight enough to achieve that, so it would be the totality of all the things we’d be looking at. It could be expectations. It could be a combination of things. But, if we—if we reach that conclusion—and we don’t see evidence supporting that conclusion—that’s what it would take I think for us to take that step.","Q&A","Press Conf","","76","2024-05"
"2024-05-01","So, on—let me address cuts. So, obviously, our decisions that we make on our policy rate are going to depend on the incoming data, how the outlook is evolving, and the balance of risks, as always. And we’ll look at the totality of the data. So I think, and we think, that policy is well positioned to address different paths that the economy might take. And we’ve said that we don’t think it would be appropriate to dial back our restrictive policy stance until we’ve gained greater confidence that inflation is moving down sustainably toward 2 percent. So, for example, let me take a path: If we did have a path where inflation proves more persistent than expected and where the labor market remains strong, but inflation is moving sideways and we’re not gaining greater confidence, well, that would be a case in which it could be appropriate to hold off on rate cuts. I think there’s also other paths that the economy could take, which, which would cause us to want to consider rate cuts. And those would be—two of those paths would be that we do gain greater confidence, as we’ve said, that inflation is moving sustainably down to 2 percent, and another path could be, you know, an unexpected weakening in the labor market, for example. So those are paths in which you could see us cutting rates. So I think it really will depend on the data. In terms of peak rate, you know, I think, really, it’s the same question. I, I think the data will have to answer that question for us. that be the key data in making that decision, or could you expand a bit more on that? Thank you.","Q&A","Press Conf","","288","2024-05"
"2024-05-01","Again, it’s, it’s—we’ve set ourselves a test that we—for us to begin to reduce policy restriction, we’d want to be confident that inflation is moving—you know, moving sustainably down to 2 percent, and, for sure, one of the things we’d be looking at is the performance of inflation. We’d also be looking at inflation expectations. We’d be looking at the whole story. But clearly, incoming, incoming inflation data would be at the very heart of that decision.","Q&A","Press Conf","","77","2024-05"
"2024-05-01","So I think it’s hard to know that. I think we’ll be able to look back, you know, from down the road and look back and understand it better. You know, if you look at—let’s look at growth. Really, what we’ve seen so far this year in the first quarter is growth coming in about consistent with where it was last year. I know GDP came in lower, but you don’t see an acceleration in growth. I mean, the thought would be that financial conditions loosened in, in, December, and that caused an uptick in activity, and that caused inflation. Presumably, that’s what we’re tightening in the labor market. You don’t really see that happening. What you see is economic activity at a level that’s roughly the same as, as last year. financial conditions. In terms of tightening, you’re, you’re right. Rates are certainly higher now and have been for some time than they were before the December meeting. And they’re higher, and that’s tighter financial conditions. And, you know, that’s appropriate, given what inflation has done in the first quarter.","Q&A","Press Conf","","181","2024-05"
"2024-05-01","So I just want to be careful that we don’t target wage growth or the labor market. And remember what we saw last year: very strong growth, a really tight labor market, and a historically fast decline in inflation. So—and that’s because we know there are two forces at work here. There’s the unwinding of the pandemic-related supply-side distortions and demand-side distortions, and there’s also monetary policy, you know, restrictive monetary policy. So I wouldn’t rule out that something like that can continue. You know, I wouldn’t give up, at this point, on further things happening on the supply side either because, you know, we do see that companies still report that there are supply-side issues that they’re facing. And also, even when the supply-side issues are solved, it should take some time for that to affect economic activity and ultimately inflation. So there are still those things. So I don’t like to say that either strong—either growth or, or a strong labor market, in and of itself, would automatically create problems on inflation, because, of course, it didn’t do that last year. wages, but we also want to see them not eaten up by high inflation. And that’s really what we’re trying to do, is to cool the economy and work with what’s happening on the supply side to bring—to bring the economy back to 2 percent inflation. Part of that will probably be having wage increases move down incrementally toward levels that are more sustainable.","Q&A","Press Conf","","247","2024-05"
"2024-05-01","Yeah. I’m not really thinking of it that way. You know, the—what we said is that we need to be more confident, and we’ve said—my colleagues and I today said that we didn’t see progress in the first—in the first quarter. And I’ve said that it appears, then, that it’s going to take longer for us to reach that point of confidence. So I don’t know how long it’ll take. You know, I can just say that when we get that confidence, then rate cuts will be in scope. And I don’t know exactly when that will be.","Q&A","Press Conf","","98","2024-05"
"2024-05-01","I—you know, not really. You know, what, what—so I thought it was appropriate to reserve judgment until, until we had the full quarter’s data, until we saw the March data. And so take a step back. What do we now see in the first quarter? We see strong economic one or two months’ data, but this is a full quarter. And I think it’s appropriate to take signal now, and we are taking signal. And the signal that we’re taking is that it’s likely to take longer for us to gain confidence that we are on a sustainable path down to 2 percent inflation. That’s the signal that we’re taking now. Yeah.","Q&A","Press Conf","","112","2024-05"
"2024-05-01","Yeah. So we will—you know, we will put the thing—we have put the thing under a microscope. I will say, nothing is going to come out of that that’s going to change the view. I think that, in fact, we didn’t gain confidence and that it’s going to take longer to get that confidence—but—confidence. I just think—you know the story. What’s happened since December is you’ve seen higher goods inflation than expected, and you’ve seen higher nonhousing services inflation than expected. And those two are working together to, to sort of be higher than we had thought. And there are stories behind how that happened, and, you know, we—I think—I think my expectation is that we will, over the course of this year, see inflation move back down. That’s, that’s my forecast. I think my confidence in that is lower than it was because of the data that we’ve seen. So, you know, we’re looking at those things. We also continue to expect, and I continue to expect, that housing services inflation, given where market rents are, those will show up in measured housing services inflation over time. We believe that it for in-housing services.","Q&A","Press Conf","","195","2024-05"
"2024-05-01","I wouldn’t say that. No. I mean, the active tool of monetary policy is, of course, the interest rates. And this is—this is a long—a plan we’ve long had in place to slow, really not in order to, you know, provide accommodation to the economy but to—or to be less restrictive to the economy. It really is to ensure that the process of shrinking the balance sheet down to where we want to get it is a smooth one and doesn’t wind up in—with financial market turmoil the way it did the last—the last time we did this and the only other time we’ve ever done this.","Q&A","Press Conf","","107","2024-05"
"2024-05-01","So, on your first question, I don’t have a probability estimate for you. But all I can say is that, you know, we’ve said that we didn’t think it would be appropriate to cut until we were more confident that inflation was moving sustainably down to 2 percent. We didn’t get our confidence, in that [it] didn’t increase in the first quarter. And, in fact, what really happened was we came to the view that it will take longer to get that confidence. And I think there are—you know, I think it’s—the economy has been very hard for forecasters broadly to predict—to predict its path. But there are paths to, to not cutting, and there are paths to cutting. It’s really going to depend on the data. In terms of the employment mandate, to your point, if you go back a couple of years, our, our sort of framework document says that, when you look at the two mandate goals, and if one of them is further away from goal than the other, then you focus on that one. It actually—it’s the time to get back there times the, you know, times how far it is from the goal. And that was clearly inflation. So our focus was very much on inflation. As—and this is what we referred to in the statement. As inflation has come down, now to below 3 percent on a—on a 12-month basis, it’s become—we’re now focusing [on] the other goal. The employment goal now comes back into focus. And so we are focusing on it. And, and that’s how we think about that.","Q&A","Press Conf","","268","2024-05"
"2024-05-01","Yeah. I’m not dealing really in likelihoods. I think there are—there are paths that the economy can take that would involve cuts and there are paths that wouldn’t. And I don’t have great confidence in which of those paths—I think I would say my personal forecast is that we will begin to see further progress on inflation this year. I don’t know that it will be enough, sufficient. I don’t know that it won’t. I think we’re going to have to let the data lead us on that. In terms of your question—your second question was stagflation. I guess I would say I was around for stagflation, and it was, you know, 10 percent—10 percent unemployment. It was high single-digits inflation. Right now we have—and very slow growth—so right now we have 3 percent growth, which is, you know, pretty solid growth I would say, by any measure, and we have inflation running under 3 percent. So I don’t—I don’t really understand where that’s coming from. And, in addition, I would say most forecasters, including our forecasting, was that last year’s level of growth was very high—3.4 percent in, I guess, the fourth quarter, you know— and probably not going to be sustained and would come down. But that would be—that would be our forecast. That wouldn’t be stagflation. That would still be to a very healthy level of growth. And, of course, with inflation, you know, our—we will return inflation to 2 percent, and that won’t be—so I don’t see the “stag” or the “flation,” actually. [Laughter]","Q&A","Press Conf","","258","2024-05"
"2024-05-01","So I think I would take that question this way: We saw a year of very high productivity growth in 2023, and we saw a year of, I think, negative productivity growth in 2022. So I think it’s hard to draw from the data. I mean, the question is, will productivity run—there are two questions. One is: Will productivity run persistently above its longer-run trend? I don’t think we know that. In terms of potential output, though, that’s a separate question. We’ve had a—what amounts to a, a significant increase in the potential output of the economy that’s not about productivity. It was about having more labor, frankly, both through—in 2022, both through participation and also through immigration. So we’re very much—like other forecasters and economists—getting our arms around what that means for potential output this year and next year—and last year for that matter, too. So I think—in that case, I think you really do have a significant increase in potential output, but you’ve also got—so you’ve got more supply. But those people also come in, they work, they have jobs, they spend. So you’ve also got demand. So it—there may be—it may be that you get more supply than you get demand at the beginning, but, ultimately, it should be neither inflationary nor disinflationary over, over a longer period.","Q&A","Press Conf","","221","2024-05"
"2024-05-01","No. I think we, we believe our policy stance is in a good place and is appropriate to the current situation. We believe it’s restrictive, and, you know, we—our evidence more from monetary policy, whereas the supply side of things that are happening are more on the supply side. So that’s how I would think about it.","Q&A","Press Conf","","57","2024-05"
"2024-05-01","Well, of course we’re not satisfied with 3 percent inflation. “Three percent” can’t be in a sentence with “satisfied.” [Laughter] So we will return inflation to 2 percent over time but over time. And we think our policy stance is, is appropriate to do that. So if we were to conclude that policy is not sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation sustainably down to 2 percent, then that would be what it would take for us to want to increase rates. We don’t see that. We don’t see evidence for that. So that’s where we are.","Q&A","Press Conf","","95","2024-05"
"2024-05-01","So I think if you listen to, and you all do, listen to my 18 colleagues on the FOMC, you’ll see that we do not lack for a diversity of voices and perspectives. We really don’t. And it’s one of the great aspects of the Federal Reserve System. We have 12 Reserve Banks around the country where they have their own economic staff, not the people who work here at the Board. There are different people. You know, and so each, each Reserve Bank has its own culture around monetary policy and its own approach and that kind of thing. It guarantees you a diversity of perspectives. So I think that the perspectives are very diverse. But—and, in terms of—in terms of dissents, you know, we have dissents. And, you know, a thoughtful dissent is a good thing, if someone really makes you think, that kind of thing. But all I can say from my standpoint is I try—I listen carefully to people. I try to incorporate their thinking or do everything I can to incorporate their thinking into what we’re doing. And I think many people, if they feel that’s happening, you know, that for most people most of the And I mean, I think we have a very diverse group of rounded people—frankly, more diverse than it used to be in many dimensions, more diverse from the obvious gender and demographic ways, but also we have more people who are not Ph.D. economists. So we have people from business and law and academia and things like that. So I think we actually do have quite a good diverse perspective. I think all of us read these stories about the lack of diversity, and we look around the room and say, “I don’t understand. I really don’t understand what they’re talking about.” So—but I get the question, though. Thank you very much.","Q&A","Press Conf","","313","2024-05"
"2024-05-01","So the policy focus has been on—has really been on what to do about, about holding the current—the current level of restriction. That’s really—that’s part of the policy. That’s where the policy discussion was in the meeting.","Q&A","Press Conf","","37","2024-05"
"2024-05-01","There isn’t any rule. You can’t look to a rule. You know, these are— these are going to be judgment calls. You know, clearly restrictive monetary policy needs more time to do its job.

And that’s the—that’s the test we’ve applied. I don’t know that—I think if we—I don’t know that this rules that in or out. I mean, really, it’s, it’s a forecast—a fairly conservative forecast month by month that would lead to slightly higher, you know, 12-months rates by the end of the year. be.","Q&A","Press Conf","","98","2024-06"
"2024-06-12","I think you’d look at the over—we’d be looking at the aggregate numbers and, and asking ourselves, “What’s going on here with inflation in the—at the aggregate level?” And, you know—and, of course, if, if—any price that contributed to ongoing inflation would, would matter. Any price that contributed to ongoing disinflation would matter, too, but I wouldn’t single out housing as having a, a special role there. Thank you very much.","Q&A","Press Conf","","71","2024-06"
"2024-06-12","So as far as the SEP part of that is concerned—as you know, I talk to—I talk to all of the other participants on the FOMC every cycle, and we talk about their Summary of Economic Projections and, and the dot plot—and, you know, their dot plot and everything. And what you—what I hear and see is that people are looking at, at, you know, a range of plausible outcomes. And in many cases, they’re—they’re thinking, “I don’t really”— you know, “I can’t really distinguish between two of these. They’re so close for me.” These are very close calls, but we ask them to write down the most likely one—so they do. And as, I think, you’ve, you’ve—as you’ve said, there’s 15 of the 19 are, are kind of clustered around one or two. So I think I would look at, at all—I’d look at all of them as plausible, but I’d look at—so I think that does tell you kind of what the Committee thinks. But what everyone agrees on is, it’s going to be data dependent. No one—no one brings to this or takes away from it that is on the Committee a really strong commitment to a particular rate path. It’s actually just their forecast and their—it’s a combination of their forecast and their own reaction function. But, again, everyone would say that this is very data dependent, and I thing.” It’s just what they think at a given moment in time, subject to data. In terms of, you know, future meetings, we haven’t, you know—we don’t—we don’t try to—we don’t make decisions about future meetings until we get there. I think in terms of what we need to see, I mentioned it earlier—we, we want to—we want to gain further confidence. Certainly, more good inflation readings will help with that. I’m not going to be specific about how many because, you know, really, it’s going to be not just the inflation rating—readings—it’s going to be the totality of the data: what’s happening in the labor market, what’s happening with the balance of risks, what’s happening with the forecast, what’s happening with growth. You look at all of that, and you ask, “Are we confident? Have we reached an appropriate level of confidence that inflation is moving down sustainably to 2 percent, or, alternatively, do we see really unexpected signs of weakness in the labor market that would call for a response?”—which is—which is another thing that could, could happen. But, again, we don’t see that. And I—we do see today’s—we see today’s report as, as progress and as, you know, building confidence. But we, we don’t see ourselves as having the confidence that would warrant—you know, that would warrant beginning to, to loosen policy at this time.","Q&A","Press Conf","","461","2024-06"
"2024-06-12","So we—this happens too often, but it, it does happen. It just is, you know—data came—I think it happened a couple of meetings ago—a few meetings ago. So when that happens—when there’s an important data print during the meeting, first day or second day— But I’m not going to get into the specifics, but you have the ability to do that. So that, you know—what’s in the SEP actually does reflect the data that we got today to the extent you can, you know, reflect it in one day. I think we’ll, you know—you will see PPI tomorrow. We’ll know more about the PCE [inflation] reading as the month goes on. But the initial CPI reading and its, you know, kind of first-level translation to, to PCE [inflation] we did have this morning. We were briefed about it, and people were able to consider whether they should make changes. And, as I said, you know, some people generally do, but most people generally don’t.","Q&A","Press Conf","","164","2024-06"
"2024-06-12","Sure. So by, by so many measures, the labor market was, was kind of overheated two years ago. And we’ve seen it gradually move back into much better balance between supply and demand. So, what have we seen? We’ve seen labor force supply come up quite a bit through immigration and through recovering participation. That’s ongoing, mostly now through the immigration channel. But still, we’ve had some increases in prime-age labor force. In terms of on the demand side, you know, we’ve seen—well, we’ve seen quits moving down. We’ve seen job openings moving down. We’ve seen wage increases moving from very, So you put all that together—what you have is still-low unemployment, still 4 percent unemployment—historically low. But it’s moved up a little bit—it’s softened a bit—and, and, you know, that’s an important statistic. But, but more than that, you’ve got strong job creation. You, you have payroll jobs still coming in strong, even though, you know, there’s an argument that they may be a bit overstated but still they’re, they’re still—they’re strong. So that’s what we see. We, we watch the labor market, of course, and the economy as a whole—but the labor market very carefully—and that’s what we see. We see gradual cooling—gradual moving toward better balance. We’re monitoring it carefully for signs of, of something more than that, but we really don’t see that.","Q&A","Press Conf","","227","2024-06"
"2024-06-12","So sometimes it’s—you can’t reconcile the differences. You just have to, have to—have to look at it and, and try to understand. And that’s why it always makes sense to look at a series, you know, in 6—in 3, 6, and 12 months of things rather than just one report. But you’re right to point to the last report, where it was your—job losses in the household survey—job gains, big job gains in the establishment survey. So, I mean, we’re left with ambiguous results, and we have to deal with that uncertainty around data. Nonetheless, the overall picture is one of a strong and gradually cooling—gradually rebalancing labor market. Job openings, while they’ve come way down, are still, you know, greater than the number of but not the superheated labor market of two years ago or even one year ago.","Q&A","Press Conf","","140","2024-06"
"2024-06-12","Yeah. The big thing that changed was the inflation forecast. So the inflation forecast moved up several tenths for the end of the year. And, and, as I mentioned earlier, in the, you know—what, what did we take away from this? We had really, really good inflation data in the second half of last year, then kind of a pause in progress in the first quarter. And what we took away from that was that it’s probably going to take longer to get the confidence that we need to begin to loosen policy. So the sense of that is that rate cuts that might take place in—might’ve taken place this year—take place next year, you know? We, we—there are—there are fewer rate cuts in the median this year, but there’s one more next year. So, so you really—if you look at year-end 2025 and ’26, you’re, you’re almost exactly where you would have been, just it—just it’s moved later because of that progress. Now, you get another—you get data—different data today. So we’ll have to see where the data light the way. You know, we’re, we’re—the economy has, you know, repeatedly surprised forecasters in both directions, and today was certainly a better inflation report than almost anybody expected. And we’ll just","Q&A","Press Conf","","211","2024-06"
"2024-06-12","So two things about that—one, one is this—you’re right, it did move up. But, but I want to remember to point out that the long-run neutral rate of interest is, is a long-run concept. It, it really is a theoretical concept—can’t be directly observed. And what it is is the, the interest rate that would hold the economy at equilibrium—maximum employment and price stability—potentially, potentially years in the future where there are no shocks. So it’s— it’s a little bit—it’s not something we observe today. Today we’ve got a very specific economy with all kinds of shocks we’re still getting over from the pandemic. So it’s—I, I don’t think that the, the concept of r-star—it’s a very important concept in economics and in what we do. But, honestly, it doesn’t really get you where you need to be to think about what appropriate policy is in the near term. But I, I—back to your original question, people have been gradually writing it up because I just think people are coming to the view that rates aren’t—are less likely to go down to their, their pre-pandemic levels, which were, you know, very low by recent history measures. Now, we, we can’t really know that. That’s, that’s an interesting dispute and discussion to have now, but, ultimately, we think that things like the neutral rate are driven by longer-run, slow-moving ultimately, temporary shocks. That’s been the debate, and we can’t know. But in the meantime, we’re making policy with the economy that we have—with the distortions that we have. And I, I also—to your other point, I, I think it is—it is the case that as time has gone by, the question of “How restrictive is policy?” has become one that everyone’s asking, and we’re asking it, too. And, you know, my answer has been that policy is restrictive. The question of whether it’s sufficiently restrictive is going to be one we, we know over time. But I think for the reasons I’ve talked about at the last press conference and, and other places, I think the evidence is pretty clear that policy is restrictive and is having, you know, the effects that we would hope for.","Q&A","Press Conf","","365","2024-06"
"2024-06-12","I’d be reluctant to try to draw that conclusion. I, I think this is about, you know, looking at the incoming data and asking, “How much progress are we making on inflation, and how is the rest of the economy doing? Is the labor market still strong?” That’s what we’re thinking about. You know, you can—you can translate it into the—into the language you’re talking about, but, to me, the focus is more on, we have a goal, which is price stability, and another goal, which is maximum employment. How are we doing there? We think we’ve got a good, strong labor market still. We think we’ve been making progress toward the price- meantime, we’re asking, “Is our policy stance about right?” And I think we think, “Yes, it’s about right.” We’re prepared to adjust that as appropriate, but we think—we think we’re getting the things that we would want to get, broadly speaking. And that’s why we’ve been at this policy rate now for almost a year.","Q&A","Press Conf","","168","2024-06"
"2024-06-12","Well, you know, it’s been coming—where’s it been coming from— let’s start with that. You know, clearly a lot of what—some of what we’ve been getting is just the reversal of the—the unwinding of the pandemic-related distortions to both supply and demand. And that is, you know—that is complemented by and amplified—supported by restrictive monetary policy. So those two things have been working together. We’ve also had a very positive supply shock on the labor side. And, and, also, you get—you get a positive supply shock when the—when the supply conditions unwind and return to normal. So you’ve had, you know, above-trend potential growth and, and high growth. And yet you’ve had the benefit of, of inflation coming down, you know, really fast, actually, last year, and you will see what the rest of this year brinks—brings. So these dynamics can continue as long as they continue. I mean, ultimately, the question is, ultimately, are you down to demand? And, and we don’t know that, progress on inflation with our current stance.","Q&A","Press Conf","","172","2024-06"
"2024-06-12","Well, we think—we think policy is restrictive. And we think, ultimately, that if you—if you just set policy at a restrictive level, eventually you will see real weakening in the economy. So that’s always been the thought is that, you know, since we raise rates this far, we’ve, we’ve always been pointing to cuts at a certain point. Not to eliminate the possibility of hikes, but, you know, no one has that as their base case, so—no one on the Committee does. But so that’s, that’s—you know, that’s how we think about it. And that’s what we’ve been getting. That’s what we’ve been getting is good progress on inflation, with growth at a—at a, a good level and with a strong labor market. Now, ultimately, we think rates will have to come down to continue to support that. But, so far, they haven’t had to. And, you know, that’s why we’re watching so carefully for signs of weakness. We don’t really see that. We kind of see what we wanted to see, which was gradual cooling in demand—gradual rebalancing in the","Q&A","Press Conf","","181","2024-06"
"2024-06-12","On housing—you know, the housing situation is a complicated one. And you can see that’s a place where rates are really having, having a significant effect. I mean, ultimately, the best thing we can do for the housing market is to bring inflation down so that we can bring rates down so that the housing market can continue to normalize. There will still be a national housing shortage, as there was before the pandemic. There will still be one, but the distortions that we see now with lock-ins and things like that—you know, low mortgages—in terms of banks, the banking system has been, you know, solid, strong, well capitalized. Lending—you know, we’ve seen good performance by the banks. We had the turmoil earlier last year, but, you know, banks have been focusing on bringing up their liquidity, bringing up their capital, and having a risk—risk-management plans in place. So the banking system, you know, seems to be—seems to be in good shape.","Q&A","Press Conf","","162","2024-06"
"2024-06-12","So I, I think it’s true that housing—that inflationary pressures have come down. But we still have—we’re still getting high inflation readings. So, you know—and I think you can see it in, in various places in—you know, in some parts of, of nonhousing services. You see elevated inflation still—and that’s probably to do with—it could be to do with wages. Goods prices have kind of fluctuated. There’s been a surprising increase in, in import prices on goods, which is kind of hard to understand. And, you know, may, may—we’ve taken some signal from that, but, you know—and, and, of course, housing services. You’re seeing—you’re continuing to see high readings there to some extent. That’s, that’s, you know, catch-up inflation from earlier pressures. But, I mean, overall, you’re right. Inflationary pressures have come down. As I mentioned, the labor market has come into better balance. Wages are still running, you know, I would say, above a, a sustainable path, which would be that of trend inflation and trend productivity. You’re still seeing wage increases moving above that. We, we haven’t thought of wages as being the principal, you know, cause of inflation. But at the same time, getting back to 2 percent inflation is likely to require a return to a more sustainable level, which is somewhat below the current level of increases in the aggregate.","Q&A","Press Conf","","225","2024-06"
"2024-06-12","Good afternoon. My colleagues and I remain squarely focused on achieving our dual-mandate goals of maximum employment and stable prices for the benefit of the American people. Our economy has made considerable progress toward both goals over the past two years. The labor market has come into better balance, with continued strong job gains and a low unemployment rate. Inflation has eased substantially from a peak of 7 percent to 2.7 percent but is still too high. We are strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent goal in support of a strong economy that benefits everyone. Today, the FOMC decided to leave our policy interest rate unchanged and to continue to reduce our securities holdings. We are maintaining our restrictive stance of monetary policy in order to keep demand in line with supply and reduce inflationary pressures. I’ll have more to say about monetary policy after briefly reviewing economic developments. Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a solid pace. Although GDP growth moderated from 3.4 percent in the fourth quarter of last year to 1.3 percent in the first quarter, private domestic final purchases—which excludes inventory investment, government spending, and net exports and usually sends a clearer signal on underlying demand—grew at 2.8 percent in the first quarter, nearly as strong as the second half of 2023. Growth of consumer spending has slowed from last year’s robust pace but remains solid. And investment in equipment and intangibles has picked up from its anemic pace last year. Improving supply conditions have supported resilient demand and the strong performance of the","Opening Statement","Press Conf","","266","2024-06"
"2024-06-12","You know, we always want to avoid the tendency to dismiss the parts of inflation that we—that we don’t like and just make it go away. So—but we had a quarter where inflation was running higher, and, yes, I could stand here and say, “It’s stuff we shouldn’t have taken signal from.” But it is what it is. You know, you, you have to—you know, low inflation is low inflation. High—so if you have a quarter where it’s higher—we tried not to take signal from the first couple of months, but we got a third month, and we said, “Okay, the signal we’re taking is that, you know, we think it’s going to take longer to get confidence that reading, which is very different—very much more positive. We’re going to have to see what the trend is—what’s, what’s going to be the data going forward. We’re looking for something that gives us confidence that inflation is, is moving sustainably down to 2 percent. And readings like today’s, you know—that’s a step in the right direction. But, you know, one reading is—isn’t—it just—it’s only one reading. You don’t want to—you don’t want to be too motivated by any single data point.","Q&A","Press Conf","","200","2024-06"
"2024-06-12","Well, you know, I, I don’t have a precise date for you. But what we said is that we, we want to make sure that we’re confident that inflation is actually moving back down to 2 percent. And when we are, then we can look at loosening policy. So having that kind of confidence that inflation will be at 2 percent just—it just pays benefits to the whole economy, to all Americans, for a long period of time. We had that period for a very long time. We very much want to get back to a place where people can, can not think about inflation—it’s just not a concern in the everyday economic decisions that they make. We were there for a long time, and our goal is to get back to that place. And we’ve made good progress, and we’re just—we’re in the phase now of just, you know, sticking with it until we get it done.","Q&A","Press Conf","","158","2024-06"
"2024-06-12","So, you know, we monitor all the things you mentioned and more. You know, what we’re seeing is, basically, spending was going up faster than disposable income during big parts of next year, so—last year, rather—and so what that—you’d expect to see is people spending more on their credit cards. That—that has been happening. Credit card balances have been going up. Credit card defaults have been going up. They’re not at high levels. Remember that after the pandemic, people were cooped up. They couldn’t spend money. They couldn’t go out to spend money; they could spend money from home. But households we see. We, we see the same data that everybody else sees, but you’ve still got a household sector that’s in—that’s in pretty good shape. You know—but, nonetheless, it’s not in the kind of shape it was in a year or two ago. And we’re, you know—we’re carefully watching that.","Q&A","Press Conf","","151","2024-06"
"2024-06-12","So consumer spending is still growing. It’s not growing at the pace it was growing at a year or so ago, but, but it’s still—it’s still growing solidly. And, by the way, other parts of the economy are picking up. Spending on equipment and intangibles is—has picked up quite a bit, you know, in the wake of all the construction that we saw of new tech— you know, tech plants. So, overall, the economy is exhibiting solid growth, and, you know— something around 2 percent—which is—which is, you know, good—a good pace of growth for the","Q&A","Press Conf","","96","2024-06"
"2024-06-12","You know—you know, when I say “unexpectedly,” the first thing is more than, kind of, is in our forecast or in common forecasts—so, something more than that. But we’ll be looking at everything. You know, we’ll—the, the labor market, you know, has the ability—has, has the tendency sometimes to, to weaken quickly. So waiting for that to happen is, is not what we’re doing. You know, we’re watching very carefully; we’re looking at the balance of risks. I always point out the balance of risks, so—and, and also the fact that we look at, at all of it—the whole situation. So, you know, a decision to begin to—you know, to loosen policy could have several reasons associated with it at a given time. But I, you know, I would just— you know, we monitor all the—all the labor market data. And if we saw troubling—weakening more than—more than expected, then that would be something we’d consider responding to.

It’s going to be the totality of the data—[including] labor market data, the growth data. In terms of inflation, you know, you’d, you’d want to see real progress that builds your confidence that we’re—that we are on a path down to 2 percent.

"2024-06-12","You know—so we are—we’re well aware of the two-sided risks here, let me just say. We, we understand that if we wait too long, that could come at the cost of economic activity, of employment, of the expansion. We understand that if we move too, too quickly, we could end up undoing a lot of the good that we’ve done and have to then start over, and it could be very disruptive. So we’re, we’re extremely aware of both of those risks and, and just basically trying to manage them. And what we said is that we’ll—that we’re—we don’t think it’ll be appropriate to, to begin to loosen policy until we’re more confident that inflation is moving down to 2 percent over time on a sustainable basis. That’s—that’s kind of been our test. Or there’s another test, which is, you know, an unexpected deterioration in labor market conditions. So I think that’s, that’s the right way for us to think about it. That’s our—that’s our dual mandate there. And, you know, we, we have a strong economy. We’ve got growth—all forecasts are very commonly around 2 percent. That’s a—that’s a strong growth rate for our we’re doing.","Q&A","Press Conf","","197","2024-06"

Or, alternatively, we see unexpected weakening in the labor market. So those are—those are two different tests. I would say, you know, we’re not— we’re not looking at any one price in any one sector and saying, “That’s the one.” We don’t target housing prices, for example. And we don’t target wages.

And we don’t tell people how they should think or feel about the economy. That’s not our job. We—you know, people experience what they experience. All I can tell you is what the—what the data show, which is, we’ve got an economy that’s growing at a solid pace. We’ve got a very strong labor market with unemployment at 4 percent. It’s been a long time since we’ve had, you know, a long stretch of time with unemployment at or below 4 percent—very long time. We had a period of high inflation. We—inflation has come down really significantly, and we’re doing everything we can to—you know, to bring that inflationary episode fully to a halt and fully restore price stability. We’re confident that we’ll get there. And in the meantime, you know, it’s going to be painful for, for people, but the ultimate pain would be a, a period of long, high—a long period of high So, you know, it’s for those people—for all Americans, but particularly for those people—that we’re doing everything we can to bring inflation back down under control.","Q&A","Press Conf","","206","2024-06"

"2024-06-12","Yeah. So what’s going on there is that we had very low readings in the second half of last year—June through December, really. And we’re now lapping those. So as you go through the 12-month window, a very low reading drops out, and a new reading comes in. The new reading gets added to the 12-month window. So it’s just a, a slight element of conservativism that we’re, we’re assuming a certain level of—of, you know, incoming monthly PCE and core PCE numbers. We’re assuming, you know, good, but not great, numbers. And if you put that on top of where we are now, you get a very slight increase in the 12-month—in the 12-month, you know, reading. Now, do we have high confidence that that’s right? No. It’s just the kind of conservative way for forecasting things. If we were to get more readings like today’s reading, then, of course, that wouldn’t be the case. So it’s just a forecasting device. I think, I think—let me say that we welcome today’s reading and then hope for more like that.","Q&A","Press Conf","","180","2024-06"

In terms of a reaction function, that’s a—that’s a long-time discussion that people have had forever. I think people have understood for a long time, actually, that we were very focused on bringing down inflation. Nobody was really confused about that. The data have, you know— again, we’ve seen significant improvement in inflation just for the last quarter. Markets move around on that—on the data, really.

If we go too soon, we can—we had a lot of advice, you know, to go ahead and cut after the seven good months of last year. We didn’t. We said we needed to see anymore for us to get the inflation results that are related to the labor market—not all inflation is, of course. So I think it’s a difficult judgment to make, and what you see is the judgment of the Committee is that that time is drawing near.

"2024-07-31","Yes, it does. And I think the lags have kind of showed up here in the last six months, by the way. You, you really do now see the restriction, whereas, I mean, even a few months ago, people were questioning how restrictive policy was. Look at the labor market now—you can see. And look at inflation—sorry—rate-sensitive, interest-sensitive spending. You really do see now that policy is restrictive. I wouldn’t say it’s extremely restrictive, but it’s certainly effectively restrictive. Yes, there—the lag should, should be on the way down. It should take some time to get into—to get into the full economy, affect financial conditions. And that affects economic activity, hiring and that kind of thing, and, ultimately, inflation. It doesn’t—it’s not instantaneous, although it’s faster than it used to be because markets move now in anticipation of our moves.","Q&A","Press Conf","","140","2024-07"
"2024-07-31","Yeah, so look, the objective is to balance the two risks, right? It’s the risk of going too soon and the risk of going too late. We’ve been—you know, we, we had seven months of good inflation data at the end of last year. We said we wanted to see more. We said—we pointed out that too much of this was coming from goods, and, sure enough, the first quarter wasn’t, wasn’t great—inflation data. And now we’ve got another quarter—a quarter that is good. And, you know, we’re balancing the risk of going too soon against the risk of going too late. That’s what we’re doing. There’s no guarantee in this. It’s a very difficult judgment call, but this is—this is how we’re making it. So—but in terms of today, your question about today, we did have a—you know, we had a nice conversation about, about this issue today. The overall sense of the Committee, as I mentioned, is that we’re getting closer to the point at which it will be appropriate to begin to dial back restriction, but we’re not quite at that point yet. We want to see more good data. The decision was unanimous—all 19 participants supported it. But there was a real discussion back and forth of what the case would be for, for moving at this meeting. A strong majority supported","Q&A","Press Conf","","226","2024-07"
"2024-07-31","Well, you know, we’ll look at everything. We’ve seen some, some tendency to have a narrowing base of job creation in some months going back, but then we’ve private demand extra carefully, to your point about, about government. So we’ll just be looking at, at all those things.","Q&A","Press Conf","","48","2024-07"
"2024-07-31","“Certainty” is not a word that we have in our—in our business. So, you know, we get—we get a lot of data between now and September, and it isn’t going to be one data read or even two. It’s going to be the totality of the data, all of the data, and not just—and then how is that affecting the outlook? And how is it affecting the balance of risks? That’s going to be the assessment that we do. Of course, we’ll, we’ll all look carefully at the employment report, but so much other data coming in and so much happening between now and the September meeting, and we’ll, you know, we’ll make a judgment.","Q&A","Press Conf","","115","2024-07"
"2024-07-31","I, I—you know, I think that we’ve been given an assignment by Congress. This is how we serve the American people is by achieving maximum employment and price stability, right? And so in our, you know, quasi-constitutional document, the Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, we look at the two goals, and if one of them is farther away than the other—the two variables, inflation and employment—if one is farther away from its goal than the other, then you, you concentrate on the one that’s farther away. And you take account of the time to reach the goal. So, for the last couple of years, the best service we could do to the American people was to focus on inflation. But as inflation has come down—and I think the upside risks to inflation have decreased as the labor market has cooled off, and now the labor market has softened—you know, probably the inflation, inflation’s probably a little farther from its target than is employment, but I think the downside risks to, to the employment mandate are, are real now. So we have to weigh all that, and if you think about where that takes us is we have a restrictive policy rate. It’s clearly restrictive. It’s been the rate we’ve had in place for a full year. And the so that we may address both mandates.","Q&A","Press Conf","","228","2024-07"
"2024-07-31","So the thing about—if what it is is seasonality, and it could just be— it’s very, very hard to, you know, to do appropriate seasonal adjustments. If that’s what it is, then that actually implies that, that other months were underreporting too low inflation. If you smoothed it out, it’s a zero-sum game. And that’s why we look at 12 months. We look at 12 months because that takes all of that out, all those effects out. Twelve-month now is 2½ percent headline, 2.6 percent core. This is so much better than where we were even a year ago. It’s a lot better. Now, the job is not done. I want to stress that, and we’re committed to equally than we did a year ago.","Q&A","Press Conf","","125","2024-07"
"2024-07-31","Yeah, I can’t really say that, honestly. You know, we’re—we— we’ve seen significant movement in the labor market, and, you know, we’re very mindful of this question of, is it just normalization or is it more? We think it’s just normalization, but we want to be in a position to, to support the labor market. At the same time, we’re seeing progress on over 4 percent. It was a completely different economy. Now we’ve made a lot of progress, and the labor market—I think unemployment was in the 3s, mid-3s, so it’s a different economy. And I think it’s time, it’s coming to be time, to adjust that so that we support this continued process. The thing we’re trying to do is—you know that we have, we’ve had this really significant decline in inflation, and unemployment has remained low. And this is a really unusual and historically, historically unusual and such a welcome outcome for the people we serve. What we’re thinking about all the time is, how do we keep this going? And this is—this is part of that. We think we don’t need to be 100 percent focused on inflation because of the progress we’ve made: 12-month headline at 2½ [percent], core at 2.6. You know, it’s way down from where it was. The job is not done on inflation, but, nonetheless, we can afford to begin to dial back the restriction in our policy rate. And I think we’re just—it’s part of a process. In terms of what that looks like, I mean, I think most rate—you would think, in a base case, that policy rates would move down from here, but I don’t want to try to give specific forward guidance about when that might be, the pace at which it might happen, because I think that’s really going to depend on the economy, and that’s highly uncertain.","Q&A","Press Conf","","312","2024-07"
"2024-07-31","We have to worry about that. I mean, we—just to make it clear, you know, it’s a very difficult, challenging judgment, and we don’t want to go too soon, and we don’t want to go too late. But that’s—this is how we made that judgment. I feel good about where we what we’re seeing, though. What we’re seeing—look at the—look at the first-half growth numbers. Look at PDFP at 2.6 percent for the first half. It’s not signaling a weak economy. It’s also not signaling an overheating economy. Labor market—admittedly, the unemployment rate has moved up seven-tenths, and we’re seeing—we’re seeing normalization there, but wage, wage increases are still at a high level. Unemployment is still at a low level. Layoffs are very low. Initial claims have moved up, but they’re pretty stable, and they’re historically not high at all. So the total scope of the data suggests a normalizing labor market, and, again, we are carefully watching to see that that continues to be the case.","Q&A","Press Conf","","167","2024-07"
"2024-07-31","So I think all of the data points continue to point to kind of the direction we would want to see. So that was taken as, you know, there was a decline in job openings. That was good. Today’s ECI reading was a little softer than expected, so that’s, that’s a good reading. It shows that wage increases are still at a strong level but that that level continues to come down to more sustainable levels over time. That’s exactly the pattern that we want to be seeing. So I think the data—the data we’ve been seeing in the labor market are broadly consistent with that normalization process. Again, we’re closely monitoring to see whether it starts to show signs that it’s more than that.","Q&A","Press Conf","","125","2024-07"
"2024-07-31","So we have, we have—growth isn’t one of our three. We have two mandates, as you know. The labor market, maximum employment is one, and stable prices is another. So we weigh—we weigh those two things equally under the law. When we were far away from our inflation mandate, we had to focus on that. Now we’re back, back to a closer to even focus, so we’ll be looking at labor market conditions and asking whether we’re getting what we’re seeing. And, as I said, we’re prepared to respond if we see that it’s—that it’s not what we wanted to see, which was, you know, a gradual normalization of conditions—if we see more than that. And it wouldn’t be any one statistic, although, of course, the unemployment rate is generally thought to be, you know, a single—a good single statistic. But we’d be looking at wages, we’d be looking at participation, we’d be looking at all the things—surveys, quits, hires, all of those things—to determine the overall status of the labor market. But we’re looking at it now. I would say, again, I think you’re back to conditions that are close to 2019 conditions, and that was not an inflationary economy—broadly similar labor markets then. I think inflation was actually—core inflation was actually running below 2 percent. So we don’t think—I don’t that’s part of what’s behind our thinking. The other part, of course, is that we have made real progress on inflation. And we’re—we’ve got growing confidence there that we are not quite there yet, but we’re more confident that we’re on a—that we’re on a sustainable path down to 2 percent. So those two things are working together, and we’re factoring those both into our policy.","Q&A","Press Conf","","288","2024-07"
"2024-07-31","So this is the very reason that we’re thinking about—that we’ve said in our—in our statement that we’re going back to looking at both mandates and that we think the risks are coming back into balance. We think what the data broadly show in the labor market is an ongoing, gradual normalization of labor market conditions. And that’s what we want to see. You know, we’ve seen that over a period of a couple of years and a move, really, from more than that, then we’re well positioned to respond. That’s, that’s part of what we’re thinking.","Q&A","Press Conf","","97","2024-07"
"2024-07-31","You know, so I would just say, really, the path ahead is going to depend on the way the economy evolves. And I can’t really give you any, any better forward guidance on it than that. We didn’t, of course, do an SEP at this meeting. We will do another one at the September meeting. I would just say, I can—I can imagine a scenario in which there would be everywhere from zero cuts to several cuts, depending on the way the economy evolves, and I wouldn’t want to lay out a baseline path for you there today. I’ve said what I—what I can say about September and about today, though.","Q&A","Press Conf","","111","2024-07"
"2024-07-31","I, I think it’s just a question of seeing more good data. We have seen—the last couple of readings have, have certainly added to confidence. And we’ve seen progress across all three categories of core PCE inflation—that’s goods, nonhousing services, and housing services. So it’s really just—you know, we had a quarter of poor inflation data at the beginning of the year. Then we saw some more good inflation data; we had seven months at the end of last year. You know, we just want to see more and, and gain confidence. And, as I said, we have—we did gain confidence, and more good data would cause us to, to gain more confidence.","Q&A","Press Conf","","113","2024-07"
"2024-07-31","So I guess I would—I would think about it this way. I’ll give an example of, of cases in which it would be appropriate to cut and maybe that it wouldn’t be remains, you know, consistent with its current condition, then I would think that a, a rate cut could be on the table at the September meeting. If, if inflation were to prove, you know, sticky and we were to see higher readings from inflation, disappointing readings, we would weigh that along with the other things. You know, I think it’s going to be not just any one thing. It’s going to be the inflation data, it’s going to be the employment data, it’s going to be the balance of risks as we see it—it’s going to be the totality of all of that that would help us make this decision.","Q&A","Press Conf","","142","2024-07"
"2024-07-31","Thank you. So on September, let me say this. We, we have made no decisions about future meetings, and that includes the September meeting. The broad sense of the Committee is that the economy is moving closer to the point at which it will be appropriate to reduce our policy rate. In that, we will be data dependent but not data point dependent, so it will not be a question of responding specifically to one or two data releases. The question will be whether the totality of the data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks are consistent with rising confidence on inflation and maintaining a solid labor market. If that test is met, a reduction in our policy rate could be on the table as soon as the next meeting in September. So you asked, why not today? And I would just say, again, that the broad sense of the Committee is that we’re getting closer to the point at which it will be appropriate to reduce our policy rate but that we’re not quite at that point yet.","Q&A","Press Conf","","181","2024-07"
"2024-07-31","Well, so, you know, the way the meeting is set up, the first day there’s a discussion of financial stability because it’s every other meeting we have that, and then we have an opportunity to comment on that. Then we have an economic go-round. And then, this morning, we have the monetary policy go-round. And I think in people’s economic or in their monetary policy go-round, people express their views about this, and, you know, there’s a range of views. People—as you will know from the speeches that they give—people have different ways of thinking about the economy. And so, in the minutes, we’ll lay this out in a much—in a much better way than I can do off the cuff, but there’s a range of perspectives. And, supported the outcome—not just the voters, but everyone. So I would also say, some people examined the possibility, you know, the case for moving at this meeting, but, overwhelmingly, the sense of the Committee was not at this meeting but as soon as the next meeting, depending on how the data come in.","Q&A","Press Conf","","181","2024-07"
"2024-07-31","So I wouldn’t say I wouldn’t want to see any other cooling. It would be more of a material difference. If we—if we’d be looking at this and if we see something that looks like a more significant downturn, that would be something that we would—we would have the intention of responding to. So, in terms of—I don’t think of it that way. I think of it as, you know, we’re actually in a good place here. We’re balancing these two risks of, you know, go too soon, and you undermine progress on inflation; wait too long or don’t go fast enough, and, and you put at risk the recovery. And so we have to balance those two things. That’s the nature of having two mandates, and I think we—this is how we balance them. It’s a rough balance, but it does feel like, again, the labor market feels like it’s in a place where it’s just a process of ongoing normalization; 4.1 percent unemployment is still historically low. And, you know, we’ll just have to see what the data show us. even below 2019 levels. Layoffs remain low. So it painted a picture of a very static labor market. Is that sustainable in your view or something that is worrying? Thank you.","Q&A","Press Conf","","213","2024-07"
"2024-07-31","We—so I would just say, the question really is, is one of, are we worried about a sharper downturn in the labor market? So, and the answer is, we’re watching really carefully for that. We’re, we’re aware of that rule, which is really a, you know, a—I would call it a statistical, statistical thing that has happened through history. A “statistical regularity” is what I’d call it. It’s not like an economic rule where it’s telling you something must happen. So, again, what do we see? What are our eyes telling us? We look at—we look at all the things we’re seeing, and what it looks like is a normalizing labor market—again, job creation at a through some of the data already, but what we think we’re seeing is, is a normalizing labor market, and we’re watching carefully to see if it—if it turns out to be more. If it starts to show signs that it’s more than that, then we’re well positioned to respond.","Q&A","Press Conf","","165","2024-07"
"2024-07-31","Good afternoon. My colleagues and I remain squarely focused on achieving our dual-mandate goals of maximum employment and stable prices for the benefit of the American people. Our economy has made considerable progress toward both goals over the past two years. The labor market has come into better balance, and the unemployment rate remains low. Inflation has eased substantially from a peak of 7 percent to 2.5 percent. We are strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent goal in support of a strong economy that benefits everyone. Today, the FOMC decided to leave our policy interest rate unchanged and to continue to reduce our securities holdings. We are maintaining our restrictive stance of monetary policy in order to keep demand in line with supply and reduce inflationary pressures. We are attentive to risks on both sides of our dual mandate, and I will have more to say about monetary policy after briefly reviewing economic developments. Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a solid pace. GDP growth moderated to 2.1 percent in the first half of the year, down from 3.1 percent last year. Private domestic final purchases, or PDFP—which excludes inventory investment, government spending, and net exports and usually sends a clearer signal of underlying demand— grew at a 2.6 percent pace over that same period, the first half. Growth of consumer spending has slowed from last year’s robust pace but remains solid. Investment in equipment and intangibles has picked up from its anemic pace last year. In the housing sector, investment stalled in the second quarter after a strong rise in the first. Improving supply conditions have supported resilient demand and the strong performance of the","Opening Statement","Press Conf","","284","2024-07"

"2024-07-31","So there’s—there are always meaningful differences. There are. And, you know, we talk a lot before, during, and after the meeting. We do have a very robust discussion of these things. You’re right that in, in most cases, people, if they feel heard and they feel that they’ve—that their position has been given serious consideration, for most people, most of the time, that’s going to be enough. There are dissents. That’s fine. You know, no one has a veto. No single person has a veto, so it just is a question of, who will vote for and against? things right, but before the pandemic, we had plenty of dissents. And dissents happen. It’s part of the process. There’s nothing wrong with dissents, and if it happens, it happens.","Q&A","Press Conf","","128","2024-07"
"2024-07-31","I think, you know, history doesn’t repeat itself; it rhymes. That statement is very true about the economy. You never assume it’s going to be just the same. An example would be, is there a trend increase in the level of vacancies? There are many, many examples, so it’s never exactly the same. Also, let’s remember that this pandemic era has been one in which so many, you know, apparent rules have been flouted, like the inverted yield curve for starters. So, many, many received—pieces of received wisdom just haven’t worked, and it’s because this situation really is unusual or unique in that so much of this inflation came from the shutdown of the economy and the resulting supply problems in the face of, admittedly, very strong demand. So the whole—the whole situation is not the same as many of the other prior inflation or downturns that we’ve seen or business cycles that we’ve seen. So we’re having to learn. We’re having to, to be very careful about the judgments that we make, I would say. So we don’t assume that these regularities will, will just repeat themselves automatically.","Q&A","Press Conf","","189","2024-07"
"2024-07-31","No. We do not do that. We absolutely do not do that. We don’t— we don’t know who’s going to win. We don’t know what they’re going to do. We don’t act as though we know, and we just can’t do that, you know? We basically—we have our forecast. We’re not—we can run simulations of different potential policies, but we would never try to make policy decisions based on the outcome of an election that hasn’t happened yet. We would just—that would just be a line we would never cross. You know, we’re a nonpolitical agency. We don’t want to be involved in any—in politics in any way, so we wouldn’t do that.","Q&A","Press Conf","","113","2024-07"
"2024-07-31","So I do take that seriously, and the Beige Book is great. What’s even greater is hearing the Reserve Bank presidents come in and talk about their conversations with, with businesses and business leaders and workers and people in the nonprofit sector in their Districts. But I’ll tell you, it’s a pretty—the picture is, is not one of a slowing or, you know, a really bad economy. It’s one of there are spots of weakness, and there are regions where growth is stronger than other regions, but, overall, it’s—again, look at the aggregate data. The aggregate data is—particularly PDFP, private domestic final purchases—is 2.6 percent, and that’s a good indicator of private—of private demand. So we listen to all of that, and it does, does—I think it’s important to listen to anecdotal data and not just look at the aggregate data. Especially, you know, it’s very hard—GDP data can be volatile quarter to quarter. So it’s just hard to measure economic activity. There are a lot of—it’s just difficult to do. So I look at both, but I wouldn’t say that the—that the anecdotal data is uniformly downbeat. It’s more mixed.","Q&A","Press Conf","","191","2024-07"

"2024-09-18","I don’t think so. I don’t—there’s—as I look—well, let me look at it this way: I don’t see anything in the economy right now that suggests that the likelihood of a solid levels. So, so I don’t really see that, no. Thank you.","Q&A","Press Conf","","43","2024-09"
"2024-09-18","No, I think—I think, and we think, they are now roughly balanced. So if you go back for a long time, the risks were on inflation. We had a historically tight labor market, historically tight. There was a severe labor shortage, so very hot labor market. And we had inflation way above target. So, you know, that said to us, concentrate on inflation, concentrate on inflation. And we did for a while, and we kept at that, that the stance that we put in place 14 months ago was a stance that was focused on bringing down inflation. Part of bringing down inflation, though, is cooling off the economy and a little bit cooling off the labor market. You now have a cooler labor market, in part because of our activity. So what that tells you is, it’s time to change our stance. So we did that. The sense of the change in the stance is that we’re recalibrating our policy over time to a stance that will be more neutral. And today was—I think we made a good strong start on that. I think it was the right decision, and I think it should send a signal that we, you know, that we’re committed to coming up with a good outcome here.","Q&A","Press Conf","","213","2024-09"
"2024-09-18","We’ll give you the second question. So the answer to your question is that, yes, those, those changes were negotiated between the agencies with my support and with my involvement, with the idea that we were going to re-propose, re-propose the changes that Vice Chair Barr talked about and then take comment on them. So, yes, that is—that’s happening with my support.","Q&A","Press Conf","","62","2024-09"
"2024-09-18","That’s not a final proposal, though, you understand. We’re putting them out for comment. We’re going to take comment and make appropriate changes. We don’t have a—we don’t have a calendar date for that, and, as for the other agencies, you know, the idea is that we’re all moving together, we’re not moving separately, so that—I don’t know exactly where that is. But the idea is that we will move as a group to put this, again, out for comment, and then, you know, it’ll—the comments will come back 60 days later, and we’ll dive into them, and we’ll try to bring this to a conclusion sometime in the first half of next year.","Q&A","Press Conf","","114","2024-09"

"2024-09-18","You know what, hold the second question.","Q&A","Press Conf","","7","2024-09"
"2024-09-18","Sure. So countries that are—democracies around the world, countries that are sort of like the United States, all have what are called independent central banks. And the reason is that people have found over time that insulating the central bank from direct control by political authorities avoids making monetary policy in a way that favors maybe people who are in office as opposed to people who are not in office. So that’s the idea, is that— you know, I think the data are clear that countries that have independent central banks, they get lower inflation. And so we’re, we’re not—we do our work to serve all Americans. We’re not serving any politician, any political figure, any cause, any issue, nothing. It’s just maximum employment and price stability on behalf of all Americans. And that’s how the other central banks are set up, too. It’s a good institutional arrangement, which has been good for the public and I hope—and I hope and strongly believe that it will continue.","Q&A","Press Conf","","167","2024-09"
"2024-09-18","So we will continue to look at that broad array of labor market data, including the payroll numbers. We’re not discarding those. I mean, we’ll certainly look at those, but we will mentally tend to adjust them based on the QCEW adjustment, which you referred to. There isn’t a bright line. You know, it will be—the unemployment rate’s very important, of course, but there isn’t a single statistic or single bright line over which that thing that might move that would dictate one thing or another. We’ll look at—each meeting, we’ll look at all the data on inflation, economic activity, and the labor market, and we’ll make decisions about, is our policy stance where it needs to be to foster over the medium term our mandate goals? So I can’t—I can’t say we have a bright line in mind.","Q&A","Press Conf","","139","2024-09"
"2024-09-18","We’re always going to try to do what we think is the right thing for the economy at that time. That’s what we’ll do. And that’s what we did today.","Q&A","Press Conf","","30","2024-09"
"2024-09-18","Well, what I can say to the public is that we had the highest—we had a burst of inflation. Many other countries around the world had a similar burst of inflation, and, when that happens, part of the answer is that we raise interest rates in order to cool the economy off in order to reduce inflationary pressures. It’s not something that people experience as pleasant, but, at the end, what you get is low inflation restored, price stability restored. And a good definition of price stability is that people in their daily decisions, they’re not thinking about inflation anymore. That’s where everyone wants to be, is back to what’s inflation, you know? Just keep it low, keep it stable. We’re restoring that. So what we’re going through now really restores—it will benefit people over a long period of time. Price stability benefits everybody over a long period of time, just by virtue of the fact that they don’t have to deal with inflation. So that’s what’s been going on, and I think we’ve made real progress. I completely—we don’t tell people how to think about the economy, of course. And, of course, people are [still] experiencing high prices, as opposed to high inflation. And we understand that’s painful.","Q&A","Press Conf","","209","2024-09"
"2024-09-18","Very hard for me to say. That’s—from our standpoint, I can’t really speak to mortgage rates. I will say that’ll depend on how the economy evolves. Our intention, though, is—we think that our policy was appropriately restrictive. We think that it’s time to begin the process of recalibrating it to a level that’s more neutral, rather than restrictive. We expect that process to take some time, as you can see in the projections that we released today. And as—if things work out according to that forecast, other rates in the economy will come down as well. However, the rate at which those things happen will really depend on how the economy performs. We can’t see—we can’t look a year ahead and know what the economy is to be doing—going to be doing. households?","Q&A","Press Conf","","133","2024-09"

"2024-09-18","Good afternoon. My colleagues and I remain squarely focused on achieving our dual-mandate goals of maximum employment and stable prices for the benefit of the American people. Our economy is strong overall and has made significant progress toward our goals over the past two years. The labor market has cooled from its formerly overheated state. Inflation has eased substantially from a peak of 7 percent to an estimated 2.2 percent as of August. We’re committed to maintaining our economy’s strength by supporting maximum employment and returning inflation to our 2 percent goal. Today, the Federal Open Market Committee decided to reduce the degree of policy restraint by lowering our policy interest rate by ½ percentage point. This decision reflects our growing confidence that with an appropriate recalibration of our policy stance, strength in the labor market can be maintained in a context of moderate growth and inflation moving sustainably down to 2 percent. We also decided to continue to reduce our securities holdings. I will have more to say about monetary policy after briefly reviewing economic developments. Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a solid pace. GDP rose at an annual rate of 2.2 percent in the first half of the year, and available data point to a roughly similar pace of growth this quarter. Growth of consumer spending has remained resilient, and investment in equipment and intangibles has picked up from its anemic pace last year. In the housing sector, investment fell back in the second quarter after rising strongly in the first. Improving supply conditions have supported resilient demand and the strong performance of the","Opening Statement","Press Conf","","272","2024-09"

"2024-09-18","Yeah, so, you know, this is my fourth presidential election at the Fed, and, you know, it’s always the same. We’re always—we’re always going into this meeting, in particular, and asking, what’s the right thing to do for the people we serve? And we do that, and we make a decision as a group, and then we announce it. And it’s—that’s always what it is. It’s never about anything else. Nothing else is discussed, and I would also point out that the things that we do really affect economic conditions for the most part with a lag. So, nonetheless, this is what we do. Our job is to support the economy on behalf of the American people. And, if we get it right, this will benefit the American people significantly. So this really concentrates the mind, and, you know, it’s something we all take very, very seriously. We don’t put up any other filters. I think if you start doing that, I don’t know where you stop. And so we just don’t do that.","Q&A","Press Conf","","174","2024-09"
"2024-09-18","So, okay, a lot of questions in there. [Laughter] Let me jump in. So, since the last meeting—okay, the last meeting we have had a lot of data come in. We’ve had the two employment reports, July and August. We’ve also had two inflation reports, including one that came in during blackout. We had the QCEW report, which suggests that maybe—that not maybe, but suggests that the payroll report numbers that we’re getting may be artificially high and will be revised down. You know that. We’ve also seen anecdotal data, like [the data collected in] the Beige Book. So we took all of those, and we went into blackout. And we thought about what to do, and we concluded that this was the right thing for the economy, for the people that we serve, and that’s, that’s how we made our decision. So that’s one question. What was the second and third?","Q&A","Press Conf","","152","2024-09"
"2024-09-18","I think it would—the way I would really characterize it is this: I think people write down their estimate, individuals do. I think every single person on the Committee, if you asked them, what’s your level of certainty around that, they would say there’s a wide range where that could fall. So I think we don’t know. There are model-based approaches and empirically based approaches that estimate what the neutral rate will be at any given time. But, realistically, we know it by its works. So that leaves us in a place where we’ll be—where we expect, in the base case, to be continuing to remove restriction, and we’ll be looking at the way the economy reacts to that. And that’ll be guiding us in our thinking about the question that we’re asking at every meeting, which is, is our policy stance the appropriate one? is up to 4.2 percent; inflation’s down to a few tenths above 2. So we know that it is time to recalibrate our policy to something that is more appropriate given the progress on inflation and on employment moving to a more sustainable level. So the balance of risks are now even. And this is the beginning of that process I mentioned, the direction of which is toward a sense of neutral, and we’ll move as fast or as slow as we think is appropriate in real time. What you have is our individual—accumulation of individual estimates of what that will be in the base case.","Q&A","Press Conf","","251","2024-09"
"2024-09-18","Sure. So a couple things. A good place to start is the—is the SEP, but let me start with what I said, which was that we’re going to be making decisions meeting by meeting based on the incoming data, the evolving outlook, the balance of risks. If you look at the SEP, you’ll, you’ll see that it’s, it’s a process of recalibrating our policy stance away from where we had it a year ago, when inflation was high and unemployment low, to a place that’s more appropriate given where we are now and where we expect to be. And that process will take place over time. There’s nothing in the—in the SEP that suggests the Committee is in a rush to will depend on the way the economy evolves. We can go quicker if that’s appropriate. We can go slower if that’s appropriate. We can pause if that’s appropriate. But that’s, that’s what we are contemplating. Again, I would point you to the SEP as just an assessment of where—what the Committee is thinking today—what the individual members, rather, of the Committee are thinking today, assuming that their particular forecasts take—you know, are realized.","Q&A","Press Conf","","194","2024-09"
"2024-09-18","The housing market, it’s hard to—it’s a game that—the housing market is in part frozen because of lock-in with low rates. People don’t want to sell their homes. So, because they have a very low mortgage, it would be quite expensive to refinance. As rates come down, people will start to move more, and that’s probably beginning to happen already. But remember, when that happens, you’ve got a seller, but you’ve also got a new buyer in many cases. So it’s not, you know, obvious how much additional demand that would make. I mean, the real issue with housing is that we have had, and are on track to continue to have, not enough housing. And so it’s going to be challenging. It’s hard to find—to zone lots that are in places really fix. But I think, as we normalize rates, you’ll see the housing market normalize. And, I mean, ultimately by getting inflation broadly down and getting those rates normalized and getting the housing cycle normalized, that’s the best thing we can do for house holders. And then the supply question will have to be dealt with by the market and also by government.","Q&A","Press Conf","","195","2024-09"
"2024-09-18","So housing inflation is the—is the one piece that is kind of dragging a bit, if I can say. We know that market rents are doing what we would want them to do, which slower than we expected. I think we now understand that it’s going to take some time for those lower market rents to get into this. But, you know, the direction of travel is clear, and as long as market rents remain, you know, relatively low inflation, over time that will show up, just the time it’s taking now, several years rather than just one or two cycles of annual lease renewals. So that’s—I think we understand that now, but I don’t think the outcome is in doubt again. As long as market rents remain under control, the outcome is not as in doubt. So I would say it’s—the rest of the portfolio—or of the elements that go into core PCE inflation have behaved pretty well. You know, they’re all—they all have some volatility. We will get down to 2 percent inflation, I believe, and I believe that, ultimately, we’ll get what we need to get out of the housing services piece, too.","Q&A","Press Conf","","196","2024-09"
"2024-09-18","No, we’re not. So inflation, you know—what we say is we want inflation—the goal is to have inflation move down to 2 percent on a sustainable basis. And, you know, we’re not really—we’re close, but we’re not really at 2 percent. And I think we’re going to want to see it be, you know, around 2 percent and close to 2 percent for some time, but we’re certainly not doing—we’re not saying “mission accomplished” or anything like that. But I have to say, though, we’re encouraged by the progress that we have made.","Q&A","Press Conf","","93","2024-09"
"2024-09-18","So this is a question—and you mean after we get through all of this? It’s just—great question that we just, we can only speculate about. Intuitively, most—many, many people anyway, would say we’re probably not going back to that era where there were trillions of dollars of sovereign bonds trading at negative rates—long-term bonds trading at is that we’re not going back to that. But, you know, honestly, we’re going to find out. But, you know, it feels—it feels to me that the neutral rate is probably significantly higher than it was back then. How high is it? I don’t—I just don’t think we know. It’s—again, we only know it by its works.","Q&A","Press Conf","","113","2024-09"
"2024-09-18","So, on the job creation, it depends on—it depends on the inflows, right? So, if you’re having millions of people come into the labor force then, and you’re creating influx across the borders, and that has actually been one of the things that’s, that’s, that’s allowed the unemployment rate to rise. And the other thing is just the slower hiring rate, which is something we also watch carefully. So it does depend on what’s happening on the supply side. On the Beveridge curve question, yes, so we all felt, on the Committee, not all, but I think everyone on the Committee felt that job openings were so elevated that they could fall a long way before you hit the part of the curve where job openings turned into higher unemployment, job loss. And yes, I mean, I think we are—it’s hard to know that—you can’t know these things with great precision, but certainly it appears that we’re very close to that point, if not at it, so that further declines in job openings will translate more directly into unemployment. But it’s been— it’s been a great ride down. I mean, we’ve seen a lot of, of tightness come out of the labor market in that form without it resulting in lower employment.","Q&A","Press Conf","","212","2024-09"
"2024-09-18","You know, more data, the usual. Don’t look for anything else. We’ll see another labor report. We’ll see another jobs report. I think we get a—we might, actually— we get two—we get a second jobs report on the day of the meeting, I think, or no, no, on the Friday before the meeting. So—and inflation data. We’ll get all this data. We’ll be watching. You know, it’s always a question of, look at the incoming data and ask what are the implications of that data for the evolving outlook and the balance of risks and then go through our process and think, what’s the right thing to do? Is policy where we want it to be to foster the achievement of our goals over time? So that’s what it is, and that’s what we’ll be doing.","Q&A","Press Conf","","136","2024-09"
"2024-09-18","Sure. So we’ll start with unemployment, which is the single most important one probably. You’re at 4.2 percent. That’s, you know—I know it’s higher than we were used to seeing, numbers in the mid- and even below mid-3s last year, but, if you look back over the sweep of the years, that’s, that’s a low. That’s a very healthy unemployment rate. And anything in the low 4s is, is a really—is a good labor market. So that’s one thing. Participation is at high levels. It’s, you know—we’ve had—we’re right—adjusted for demographics for aging, participation’s at pretty high levels. That’s a good thing. Wages are still a bit above what would be their—wage increases, rather, are still just a bit above where they would be over the very longer term to be consistent with 2 percent inflation, but they’re very much coming down to what that sustainable level is. So we feel good about that. Vacancies over—per unemployed is back to what is still a very strong level. It’s not as high as it was. That number reached two to one, two vacancies for every unemployed person. As measured, it’s now below—it’s around one. But that’s still—that’s still a very good number, I would say. You know, quits have come back down to normal levels. I mean, I could go on and on. There are many, many employment indicators. What do they say? They say this is still a solid labor market. The question isn’t the level; the question is that there has been change, particularly over the last few months, and, you know, so what we say is, as the risks, the upside risks, to inflation have really come down, the position to manage the risks to both of our goals.","Q&A","Press Conf","","291","2024-09"
"2024-09-18","So, you know, what I would say is, we don’t think we need to see further loosening in labor market conditions to get inflation down to 2 percent. But we have a dual mandate, and I think you can take this whole action as—take a step back, what have we been trying to achieve? We’re trying to achieve a situation where we restore price stability without the kind of painful increase in unemployment that has come sometimes with disinflation. That’s what we’re trying to do.

"2024-09-18","So we’re—that’s—you know, our plan, of course, has been to begin to recalibrate and we’re—as you know, we’re not seeing rising claims, we’re not seeing rising layoffs, we’re not seeing that, and we’re not hearing that from companies that that’s something that’s getting ready to happen. So we’re not waiting for that, because, you know, there is—there is thinking that the time to support the labor market is when—is when it’s strong and not when we begin to see the layoffs. There’s some lore on that. So that’s the situation we’re in. We have, in fact, begun the cutting cycle now, and we’ll be watching—and that’ll be one of the factors that we consider. Of course, we’re going to look at the totality of the data as we make these decisions meeting by meeting.","Q&A","Press Conf","","134","2024-09"
"2024-09-18","We’re going to be watching all of the data, right? So if—as I mentioned in my remarks, if the labor market were to slow unexpectedly, then we have the ability to react to that by, by cutting faster. We’re also going to be looking at our other mandate, though. We are more—we have greater confidence now that inflation is moving down to 2 percent, but, at the same time, our plan is that we will be at 2 percent, you know, over time. So—and policy, we think, is still restrictive, so that should still be happening.","Q&A","Press Conf","","96","2024-09"
"2024-09-18","We’re going to take it meeting by meeting, as I mentioned. There’s no sense that the Committee feels it’s in a rush to do this. We made a good, strong start to this, and that’s really, frankly, a sign of our confidence—confidence that inflation is, is coming down toward 2 percent on a sustainable basis. That gives us the ability. We can, you know, make a good, strong start. But—and I’m very pleased that we did. To me, the logic of this, both from an economic standpoint and also from a risk-management standpoint, was clear. But I think we’re going to go carefully, meeting by meeting, and make our decisions as we go.","Q&A","Press Conf","","113","2024-09"

"2024-09-18","Okay, multiple questions in there. So I would say we don’t think we’re behind.

Sorry, your other question was?","Q&A","Press Conf","","50","2024-09"
"2024-09-18","I think we had a good—a good discussion. You know, if you go back, I talked about this at Jackson Hole, but I didn’t address the question of the size of the cut and left it open, and I think we left it open going into blackout. And so there was a lot of discussion back and forth, good diversity of—excellent discussion today. I think there was also broad support for the decision that the Committee voted on. So I would add, though, look at the","Q&A","Press Conf","","86","2024-09"
"2024-09-18","So I think it’s about—we come into this with a policy position that was put in place, as you know, I mentioned, in July of 2023, which was a time of high inflation and very low unemployment. We’ve been very patient about, about reducing the policy rate. We’ve waited. Other central banks around the world have cut, many of them several times. We’ve waited, and I think that that patience has really paid dividends in the form of our confidence that inflation is moving sustainably under 2 percent. So I think that is what enables us to take this, this strong move today. I do not think that anyone should look at this and say, “Oh, this is the new pace.” You know, you have to think about it in terms of the base case. Of course, what happens will happen. So, so, in the base case, what you see is—look at the SEP, you see cuts moving along. The sense of this is we’re recalibrating policy down over time to a more neutral level. And we’re moving at the pace that we think is appropriate given","Q&A","Press Conf","","187","2024-09"
"2024-09-18","So, in the current situation, reserves have really been stable. They haven’t come down. So reserves are still abundant and expected to remain so for some time. As you know, the shrinkage in our balance sheet has really come out of the overnight RRP [facility]. So I think what that tells you is, we’re not thinking about, about stopping runoff because of this at all. We know that these two things can happen side by side. In a sense, they’re both a form of normalization, and so, for a time, you can have the balance sheet shrinking but also be cutting rates.","Q&A","Press Conf","","102","2024-09"
"2024-09-18","So I think what we’re seeing is, clearly labor market conditions have cooled off by any measure, as I talked about in Jackson Hole, and—but they’re still at a level— the level of those conditions is actually pretty close to what I would call maximum employment. By many other measures, the labor market has returned to or below 2019 levels, which was a very good, strong labor market, but this is more sort of 2018, ’17. So the labor market bears close—bears close watching, and we’ll be giving it that. But ultimately, we think—we believe, with an appropriate recalibration of our policy, that we can continue to see the economy growing, and that will support the labor market. In the meantime, if you look at the growth in economic activity data, retail sales data that we just got, second-quarter GDP—all of this indicates an economy that is still growing at a solid pace. So that should also support the labor market over time. So—but again, we’re—it bears watching. And we’re watching.","Q&A","Press Conf","","171","2024-09"

So, for example, if we were to see the labor market deteriorating, we’d be prepared to move more quickly. Alternatively, as we approach levels that are plausibly neutral or close to neutral, it may turn out to be appropriate to slow the pace at which we’re dialing back restriction.

"2024-11-07","So that’s a—you know, the whole plan is not to have stagflation, so we don’t have to deal with it. So that’s our—that is actually our plan. [Laughter] You know, it’s, of course, a very difficult thing because you’re—you know, you’re—anything you do with interest rates will, will hurt one side or the other, either the inflation mandate or the—or the employment mandate. I would just say that, you know, we’ve, we’ve been able to see inflation come down a whole lot, you know, much closer to our goal without the kind of sharp increase in unemployment that has often accompanied programs of disinflation. So knock on wood, we’ve gotten this far without seeing a real weakening in, in the labor market. And we believe we can complete the inflation task while also keeping the labor market strong, and that, of course, is exactly what we’re trying to do.","Q&A","Press Conf","","149","2024-11"

"2024-11-07","So we, we would be concerned if we saw—if we thought we saw longer-term inflation expectations anchoring at a higher level. That’s not what we’re seeing. We’re still seeing between surveys and market readings broadly consistent with—you know, I, I looked at the five-year, five-year earlier today, and it’s probably moved, but it’s just not—it’s just—it’s kind of right where it’s been, and also it’s pretty close to consistent with 2 percent PCE inflation. So that’s one that’s been a traditional one that we look at a lot. But, overall, expectations seem to be—and really have throughout this—in a place that’s consistent with 2 percent inflation. But you’re right to say we watch that very carefully, and we will not allow inflation expectations to drift upward. But that’s, that’s really why we reacted so sharply back in 2022 was, was to avoid that. about what you’ve heard from business leaders on the economy, but many average Americans are still not feeling the strength of the economy in their wallets. So what’s your message to them on when they might expect relief?","Q&A","Press Conf","","181","2024-11"
"2024-11-07","No. I was not referring to, to the new Administration’s policies at all, nor will I today. So I—what I’m just saying is, as we look ahead, we know—and I mentioned this in my statement—that the risks are two sided. I guess I should start by saying that we think that the economy and we think our policy are both in a very good place, a very good place. And—but as you look forward, you say, “What are the risks?” And one risk is that we would move too quickly and find ourselves having moved too quickly, and inflation comes back, and we—and we lost our chance to get inflation back to 2 percent. So we have to avoid that risk. And that, that—to avoid that risk, that means you want to move carefully. The other risk is that we move too slowly and that we allow the labor market to weaken too much and do unnecessary damage to the labor market and to people’s working lives. That, that says, “Don’t get behind the curve.” So these are two—these two things are the two risks that we have to manage. And so we’re, we’re in the middle there. We try to be in the middle and deal with both of the—manage both of those. Again, the idea is to maintain support, the strength that we have in the labor market and in the economy, but also with somewhat less restrictive but still restrictive policy, enable further progress toward our 2 percent inflation goal. And so there’s—you know, there— this is the thing: Meeting by meeting, we’re going to be making our assessment of what the right path is. neutral, a more neutral policy. We don’t know exactly where that is; we only know it by its works. We’re pretty sure it’s below where we are now. But as we move further, there will be more uncertainty about where that is. And we’re going to move carefully as, as this goes on so that, you know, we can increase the chances that we will get it right.","Q&A","Press Conf","","346","2024-11"

"2024-11-07","But if you look at three- and six-month core PCE, you’ll see they’re around 2.3 percent. So we look at all of them. And we look at—we also—we look at 12 as well. But what it’s telling us is that we really have made significant progress. And we expect there to be bumps. For example, you know, the, the last three months of last year, the core PCE readings were very, very low—probably unsustainably low. So that’s why you see—that’s why forecasts generally see a couple of upticks toward the end of the year. On the other hand, the January reading certainly looks like an example of residual seasonality, so that we saw last year. So when that falls out of the 12-month calculation in February, we should see it staying down. So there will literally be a bump up and then down. We understand that. things. One is the nonhousing services and goods, which together make up 80 percent of that— of the core PCE index, are back to the levels they were at the last time we had sustained 2 percent inflation, which happens to be in the early 2000s for a period of five, six, seven years. So they’re back at that level. What’s not is housing services. So let’s talk about housing services. Housing services is higher. What’s going on there is, you know, market rents, newly signed leases, are experiencing very low inflation. And what’s happening is older, you know, leases that are turning over are taking several years to catch up to where market, market leases are—market rent leases are. So that’s just a catch-up problem. It’s not really reflecting current inflationary pressures; it’s reflecting past inflationary pressures. So that’s, that’s one thing. The other thing is, I’d say look at the labor market—not a source of inflationary pressures. Where is it coming from? It’s not a very tight economy. What is the story about inflation? You see that catch-up inflation also in insurance and in several other areas. So you’re seeing—we’re not, not declaring victory, obviously, but we feel like the story is very consistent with inflation continuing to come down on a bumpy path over the next couple of years and settling around 2 percent. That story is intact, and it won’t be one or two really good data months, or bad data months aren’t going to really change the pattern at this point, now that we’re this far into the process.","Q&A","Press Conf","","410","2024-11"

"2024-11-07","So you’re right. As I mentioned, and as you mentioned, the latest economic data have been strong, and that’s, of course, a great thing and highly welcome. But, of course, our mandate is maximum for employment and price stability, and we think that even with today’s cut, policy is still restrictive. We understand it’s not possible to say precisely how in balance. It is continuing to cool, albeit at a—at a modest rate, and we don’t need further cooling, we don’t think, to achieve our inflation mandate. So that’s the labor market. Inflation has moved down a great deal from its higher—its highs of two years ago, and we judged, as I mentioned, that it’s on a sustainable path back to 2 percent. So the job’s not done on inflation. But if you look at those two things, we judged in September that it was appropriate to begin to recalibrate our policy stance to reflect this progress, and today’s decision is really another step in that process. Overall, as I mentioned, we believe that with an appropriate recalibration of our policy stance, we can maintain strength in the labor market even as our policy stance enables further progress toward our inflation goal.","Q&A","Press Conf","","202","2024-11"

So, you know, it’s material changes and financial conditions that last, that are persistent, that really matter. And we don’t know that about these. What we’ve seen so far?

And, and that’s very much what we’re on. That has not changed at all since September. And, you know, we’re just going to have to see where the—where the data lead us. We have, you know, a whole six weeks of data to look at to make that decision in December. Obviously, I’m not ruling it out or in, but, but, you know, I would say—you know, I would say that, you know, again, we didn’t update the SEP, so I’m not going to characterize, you know, where the Committee would be.","Q&A","Press Conf","","126","2024-11"

So I can’t really speak for kind of exactly where the—where the Committee is. I would just say, for December, we’re going to be—again, in every meeting—we’re going to be looking at the incoming data and how that affects the outlook. As you know, we’re in the process of recalibrating from a fairly restrictive level at 5.33 percent. After today’s move, we’re down 75 basis points. And we’re, we’re asking ourselves, “Is that where we need to be?” You know that we’re, we’re trying to steer between the risk of moving too quickly and perhaps undermining our progress on inflation or moving too slowly and allowing the labor market to weaken too much. We’re trying to, to be on a middle path where we can maintain the strength in the labor market while also enabling further progress thinking, because we don’t fill out an SEP at this meeting.","Q&A","Press Conf","","172","2024-11"

You know, people are—let’s talk about the data we’ve gotten since the last meeting. So, in the main, the economic activity data have been stronger than expected. The NIPA revision was stronger. Certainly, the September employment report was stronger; the October report, not stronger; retail sales, stronger. So, overall, though, I think you take away a sense of, of some of the downside risks to economic activity having, having been diminished, with the NIPA revisions in particular, and so, overall, feeling, feeling good about economic activity. So I think we would factor that in. know, by December we’ll have—we’ll have more data: I guess one more employment report, two more inflation reports, and lots of other data, and, you know, we’ll make a decision as we get to December.","Q&A","Press Conf","","157","2024-11"

I guess that, you know, the long- Ultimately, I’m sure we’ve all read these decompositions of what, you know—and I certainly have, but it’s not really our job to provide our specific decomposition. I will say, though, that it appears that the moves are not, not principally about higher inflation expectations. They’re really about a sense of more likely to have stronger growth and perhaps less in the way of downside risks. So that’s what they’re about. You know, we do take financial conditions into account. If they—if they’re persistent and if they’re material, then we’ll certainly take them into account in our policy. But I would say we’re not at—we’re not at that stage right now. It’s just something that we’re watching. And, again, these things don’t really have mainly to do with, with Fed policy, but to do with other factors in the economy.","Q&A","Press Conf","","172","2024-11"
"2024-11-07","Good afternoon. My colleagues and I remain squarely focused on achieving our dual-mandate goals of maximum employment and stable prices for the benefit of the American people. The economy is strong overall and has made significant progress toward our goals over the past two years. The labor market has cooled from its formerly overheated state and remains solid. Inflation has eased substantially from a peak of 7 percent to 2.1 percent as of September. We are committed to maintaining our economy’s strength by supporting maximum employment and returning inflation to our 2 percent goal. Today, the FOMC decided to take another step in reducing the degree of policy restraint by lowering our policy interest rate by ¼ percentage point. We continue to be confident that, with an appropriate recalibration of our policy stance, strength in the economy and the labor market can be maintained, with inflation moving sustainably down to 2 percent. We also decided to continue to reduce our securities holdings. I’ll have more to say about monetary policy after briefly reviewing economic developments. Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a solid pace. GDP rose at an annual rate of 2.8 percent in the third quarter, about the same pace as in the second quarter. Growth of consumer spending has remained resilient, and investment in equipment and intangibles has strengthened. In contrast, activity in the housing sector has been weak. Overall, improving supply conditions have supported the strong performance of the","Opening Statement","Press Conf","","247","2024-11"

"2024-11-07","Sure. So on your first question, I’m not going to talk about anything that relates directly or indirectly to the election. On the second one, you’re—you know, this is the great question, and it’s the one we think about all the time. So I’ll just say a couple things. significantly from a year or so ago. So we’ve seen a big change upward in unemployment. Sometimes that has meant bad things. So far, it doesn’t appear to be. It appears that the—I wouldn’t say that the labor market has fully stabilized, because I do think it’s continuing to very gradually cool, but it seems to be in a good place. And our policy, of course, is designed to keep it in that good place, to maintain the strength in the labor market, while also enabling further progress on inflation. You know, you mentioned a bunch of, of indicators, and you’re right. You know, the, the openings to unemployment rate is back to a normal level. I would—I would characterize it more broadly as “normalizing.” You mentioned wages. Wages are still running just a bit above where they would need to be to be consistent with 2 percent inflation, unless productivity is going to remain at this high level. If we see the—if we see productivity, you know, more sustainably at these high levels, then that would sustain higher wage gains. So I would say—in fact, you can say it the other way, that, that wage increases are now consistent with 2 percent inflation given current productivity readings. But, of course, you know, the lore on productivity readings is whenever you see high readings, you should assume they’re going to revert pretty quickly to the longer-term trend. That has always been the case for 50 years. But, you know, it may be that—we’re now five years. If you look at the NIPA revisions that came out a month ago, we’re five years into, into a nice set of productivity readings, which are sustained and very healthy. But, overall, it’s a good labor market. We could talk about 20 different data series. We’ll be looking at all of them, of course.","Q&A","Press Conf","","359","2024-11"
"2024-11-07","So you’re right that, you know, we say that the economy is performing well, and it is, but we also know that people are still feeling the effects of high prices, for example. And we went through—the world went through a global inflation shock, and inflation went up everywhere. And, you know, it, it stays with you because the price level doesn’t come back down. So what that takes is it takes some years of real wage gains for people to feel better. And that’s what we’re—that’s what we’re trying to create. And I think we’re well on the road to creating that. Inflation has come way down. The economy is still strong here. Wages are moving up but, but at a sustainable level. So it’s just—I think—I think what needs to happen is happening and, for the most part, has happened. But it’ll be some time before people, you know, regain their confidence and feel that. And, you know, we don’t tell people how to—how to feel about the economy. We respect—completely respect—what they’re feeling. Those feelings are true; they’re accurate. We don’t question them.

So I don’t really think the public is experiencing that as a surprising upside risk to inflation. I, I think inflation is much lower. What the public is feeling, and they’re right about it, is that prices are, are just—the price level went up, because of the past inflation. It is going to take some time to, for real wages to recover, over a period of years in which your, your real compensation is growing. And, in other words, your compensation’s growing meaningfully faster than inflation. That’s exactly the kind of economy we have now, and we just want to hold onto it.

Let’s remember that the economy’s growing 2½ percent this year, that But since, you know—so, so what’s really driving the, the slower rate-cut path? First thing is growth is stronger, right? We, the economy grew faster in the second half of 2024, so far, than we had expected and is expected to be above what our expectations in September next year as well. Unemployment is lower, and, you know, in the SEP, you’ll see that participants think that the—that the downside risks are less and uncertainty is less. And so that’s, that’s more strength, right? Inflation is higher, as we talked about. Inflation’s higher this year. It’s also higher in the forecast next year. I’d also point out that we’re, we’re closer to the neutral rate, which is another reason to be cautious about, about further moves. And—but then getting to your—to your point, there’s also, there’s uncertainty—uncertainty around inflation, I pointed out, is actually higher. It’s also—it’s also, in the case of some people, some people—the way I’d say it is this: Some people did take a very preliminary step and start to incorporate highly conditional estimates of economic effects of policies into their forecast at this meeting and said so in the meeting. Some people said they didn’t do so, and some people didn’t, didn’t say whether they did or not. So we have people making a bunch of different approaches to that. But some did identify policy uncertainty as one of the reasons for their, their writing down more uncertainty around inflation. And, you know, the point of that uncertainty is, it’s kind of commonsense thinking that when the path is uncertain you go a little bit slower. It’s not unlike driving on a foggy night or walking into a dark room full of furniture. You just slow down. And so that may have affected some of the people. But as, as I said, there’s a range of—range of approaches on the Committee. substantially. The only thing, really, that’s happened—you, you mentioned that the disinflationary story remains intact, yet the risk weighting has jumped to the upside. The only real thing that’s happened is November 5th, in the meantime. Is it fair to say that that’s what’s driving the higher sense of upside risk on inflation?","Q&A","Press Conf","","416","2024-12"
"2024-12-18","You know, we, we can’t know that with any tremendous certainty. I, I will say that we think that, that our policy balances the risks—we think the risks are roughly in balance as between the two mandates, and we think the labor market is, is in solid shape. And when I say it’s softening or cooling, it’s very gradual process. You know, job creations are, are meaningfully positive; wages are, you know, if anything, a little, still a bit above what would be sustainable if productivity were to revert to its longer-run trend. If you, if you take into account the high productivity readings we’ve had, then wages are already at a sustainable level relative to 2 percent inflation. So, again, I, I don’t want to overstate the downside in the labor market, because the downsides clearly appear to have diminished. Nonetheless, it’s, it’s one of our mandate goals, characterize it, and that’s why we’re paying careful attention.","Q&A","Press Conf","","158","2024-12"
"2024-12-18","I don’t think so, no. I think, overall, if you look at it, prime-age participation is still very high. What, what’s going on in the labor market is that the hiring rate is low. So if you—if you have a job, you’re doing very well, and layoffs are very low, right? So people are not losing their jobs in large numbers, unusually large numbers. If you are looking for a job, though, the hiring rate is low, and that’s a signal of, of lower demand, and it has come the labor market. Again, not something we need to see to get 2 percent inflation. And, you know, that’s part of the reason that explains why we moved ahead today with, with our, with the action, with, with an additional cut. So, but you take a step back, the level of unemployment is very low—again, participation is high. Wages are at a healthy and, and ever more sustainable level—wage growth. And so the labor market—this is a good, a good labor market, and, you know, we want to keep it that way.","Q&A","Press Conf","","181","2024-12"

"2024-12-18","So we, we do look carefully at financial conditions, of course; that’s part of what we do. But, you know, we, we really look carefully at is the performance of our— of our goal variables and, and how are we affecting the economy. So what we’ve seen over the course of—just take the last year. We, we’ve seen inflation—well, over the last couple of years—come down a lot. We’ve seen the labor market cool off quite a bit. That suggests that our policy is restrictive. We’ve, we can also look more directly at, at the parts of the economy that are affected by—that, that are interest sensitive, like particularly housing. Housing activity is, is very low, and that’s partly, significantly because of our policy. So we think our policy is working. It’s transmitting, and it’s having the effects on our goal variables that we would want. You know, a lot of things move financial conditions around, as you know, and we don’t really control those. But I’d say we, we see the effects we’re hoping to see on, on the goal variables and, and the places where we’d expect to see it.","Q&A","Press Conf","","192","2024-12"

"2024-12-18","We’re not—we’re not renaming the phase—yet. But we may get around to that. But, no, I, I would say we, we are, though, in, in a new phase in the process, as I said. So, and that’s just because we’ve reduced—we’ve reduced our policy rate by 100 basis points. We’re significantly closer to neutral. We still think where we are is meaningfully, meaningfully restrictive, and I think from this point forward, you know, it’s appropriate to move support the decision, and, and I think it was the right decision to make. I think from now we are in a place where the risks really are in balance, and we need to see progress on inflation. And that’s, that’s how we’re thinking about it. So it is kind of a new thing. We moved pretty quickly to get to here, and I think going forward, obviously, we’re going to be moving slower, which is consistent with, with the","Q&A","Press Conf","","157","2024-12"
"2024-12-18","So I—what I said is, we don’t think we need further softening to get to 2 percent inflation. That’s what I’m saying, not that it’s not welcome. We don’t need it, we don’t think. If, if you had a situation where inflation’s moving around by a tenth every few months, that’s, you know, we’d have to weigh that against the fact that inflation has in recent months been moving sideways in the 12-month window. And so we’ve got to weigh them both, at this point. You know, for a while there we were only really focused mainly, mainly focused on, on inflation. We’ve now gotten to a place where, where the risks of the two are what we think are broadly, roughly in balance. And so that’s how we think about it.","Q&A","Press Conf","","132","2024-12"
"2024-12-18","The, the unemployment rate has now—is now the same as it was in July: 4.2 percent. It’s moved up and down, but it’s now the same as July. And job creation is, is lower than it has been, but it’s been—it’s been steady—it’s not—it’s not declining. It’s been steady at a level which, as I pointed out a couple times, is actually below the level that would hold the unemployment rate constant, but it’s not so far below. So, you might—you might—if, if we have the, the breakeven level right, and if jobs continue—job creation continues at that level in the establishment survey, then you would get a tenth maybe every other month kind of thing. So gradually declining. But we don’t have that kind of precision in this. So, but you’re right, though, and I, I read out some of the reasons. We, we do think the labor market is still cooling by many measures, and we’re watching that closely. It’s, it’s not cooling in a—in a quick or in a way that really raises concerns. I think, you know, you pointed out participants in the FOMC really thought that the risks and uncertainty had improved relative watching it closely.","Q&A","Press Conf","","201","2024-12"
"2024-12-18","So confidence was our test for raising rates, and, you know, we’ve made—look, look at the broader suite: We’ve made just a great deal of progress. We’re, you know, we’re well into the 2’s in, in core inflation and around 2½ [percent]—or even lower than that, we have been—for headline inflation. So I, I would say I’m confident that inflation has come down a great deal, and I, I’m confident in the story about why it’s come down and why that portends well. And I’ll—and I’ll tell you why. You, again, you do see with housing services inflation, which is one that we’ve really worried, worried about, it really has come down now quite steadily, at a slower pace than we thought, you know, two years ago, but it’s rents is new leases. So that, that’s happening; that process is ongoing pretty much as we expect. Goods inflation, which is another big piece of it, has returned right to the range where it was before the pandemic. Just for some months this year it kind of moved up in a bumpy way because of used cars and things like that. But we think, overall, that should generally be in the range it was in. Then that leaves nonhousing services, and market-based nonhousing services are in, in good shape. It’s nonmarket services, and those are—those are services that are imputed rather than measured directly, and they, they don’t, we, we think they don’t really tell us much about the, you know, about tightness in the economy. They don’t really reflect that. I mean, a good example is financial services, which is really done off of asset prices, and that just—so that, that’s how that inflation works. So the overall picture, the story of why inflation should be coming down, is still intact. In particular, the labor market—look at the labor market. It’s, it is cooler by so many measures now—modestly cooler than it was in 2019, a year when inflation was well under 2 percent. So it’s not a source of inflationary pressures. Not to say there aren’t regional and, and, you know, particular professions where labor is tight. But, overall, you’re not getting inflationary impulses of any significance from the labor market. So what’s the story? The story is still just, we’re unwinding from these large shocks that the economy got in 2021 and ’22 in, for example, housing services, and now also in, in insurance, in particular, where costs went up, and those are now being reflected later in housing insurance. It’s real inflation, but it doesn’t portend persistently high inflation. So we and most other forecasters still feel that we’re on track to, you know, to get down to 2 percent. It might","Q&A","Press Conf","","455","2024-12"
"2024-12-18","You know, it, it breaks down into a long answer, if you want, but it just has been a little bit more stubborn. I think if you go back two or three years, many people were saying that to get this far down we would’ve had to have a, had a deep recession and, you know, high unemployment by now. Well, that has not been the case, so, you know, the, the path down has actually been much better than many predicted. We, we’ve managed to, to have the unemployment rate remain essentially at its longer-run natural rate, while inflation has come down from—you know, core PCE inflation has come down from 5.6 percent to 2.8 percent on a 12-month basis. So that’s, that’s a pretty good outcome. Why hasn’t it come down [more]? One reason is that, that—just a technical issue around the way we calculate housing services, and that, that process has been slower than—market rents have, are showing up more slowly in that measure than we might have thought three, two, two years ago. So that’s part of it. I think there are other, other parts of the story, but, you know, the, the—what, what I think people are feeling right now is the effect of high prices, not high inflation. So we, we understand very well that prices went up by a great deal, and people really feel that. And it’s advanced economies at the same time. So now we have—inflation itself is way down, but people are still feeling high prices, and that is—that is really what people are feeling. The best we can do for them—and that’s who we work for—is to get inflation back down to its target and keep it there so that people are earning, you know, big, real wage increases so that their, their wages are going up, their, their compensation is going up faster than inflation year upon year upon year. And that’s what will restore people’s good feeling about the economy. That’s what it will take, and that’s what we’re aiming for.","Q&A","Press Conf","","344","2024-12"
"2024-12-18","So the, the risks that you—sorry, the rates that you talked about are, are really longer-run rates, and they’re affected, they are affected to some extent by Fed policy, but they’re also affected by many other things. And longer rates have actually gone up quite a bit since September, as, as you well know, and those are the things that drive, for example, mortgage rates more than short-term rates do. So we look at that, but we look at all financial conditions, and then we look at what’s happening in the economy. So what we see happening in the economy, again, is, you know, most forecasters have been calling for a slowdown in growth about at the same level. So the","Q&A","Press Conf","","121","2024-12"
"2024-12-18","Let me—let me find these numbers. So we have—we have inflation coming down, core inflation coming down to 2½ [percent] next year. That’s, that’d be—that’d be significant progress. You see a slower path. I think that does take on board that we want to see real progress. But we, we, you know, we’d be seeing meaningful progress to get inflation down to that level. That wouldn’t be all the way to 2 percent, but that would be, it would be, you know, better than this year. This year, [it] will be 2.8 or 2.9. That would be meaningful. We, we also have to think about the, the, you know, the labor market. And while we, we have the labor market forecast as being in good shape, we are also mindful that it is still out there very gradually cooling, so far in an orderly, gradual way. But it’s also something we need to keep our eye on.","Q&A","Press Conf","","157","2024-12"
"2024-12-18","So the, the main thing is—and this is also a point in these alternative simulations—is that there’re just many, many factors that go into what, what—how much tariffs will, will even go into consumer inflation. How persistent will that be? And, you know, so, we just—we just don’t know, really, very much at all about the actual policies, so it’s very premature to try to make any kind of conclusion. We don’t know what’ll be tariffed, from what countries, for how long, and what size. We don’t know whether there’ll be, you know, retaliatory tariffs. We don’t know what the, you know, the transmission of any of that will be into consumer prices. To your—to your point as well, I don’t—I wouldn’t say that we know whether the last episode is or is not a good model for what happened. You pointed out we’ve just been through a period of high inflation. We’ve just gotten through that period. That’s a difference. It was also quite a bit of diversion of trade away from China to other countries, since that, that may—that may have affects. I don’t know. I just think we, we need to take our time, not rush, and make a very careful assessment, but only when we’ve actually seen what the policies are and how they’re implemented. And, you know, we’re just—we’re just not at that stage. We’re at the stage of doing what other forecasters are doing—which is kind of thinking about these questions, but not, not trying to get to definitive answers for some time.","Q&A","Press Conf","","259","2024-12"
"2024-12-18","So I do think that the 2018, the September 2018 Tealbook alternative simulations are a good place to start. I happened to have brought them here with me today. I’m sure you have them too. They’re, they’re a good starting point, and, and I would just say, you know, it’s six-years-old analysis. But nonetheless, this is still, I think, I think the right, the right questions to ask. And, you know, there, there were two simulations: one was—one was “seeing through,” one was not. And I point you to, you’ll— there’s some language in the—in the “see- through” paragraph. It says, you know, it considers situations in which it might be appropriate to “see through” inflation and then, and then names some conditions that in, in which it might not be. In any case, this is not a question that’s in front of us right now. We, we won’t face that question—we don’t know when we’ll face that question. What the Committee’s doing now is, is discussing pathways and understanding, again, the ways in which tariff-driven inflation can affect—tariffs can affect inflation and the economy, and, and how to think about that. So, we’re, we’re—we’ve done a bit of, good bit of work, all of us have, each of us has, and, you know, it puts us in position, when we finally do see what the, what the actual policies are, to be, to make, you know, a more, more careful, thoughtful assessment of what might be the appropriate policy response.","Q&A","Press Conf","","251","2024-12"
"2024-12-18","Actually, that’s not the only thing that’s happened. What’s happened is that our forecast for inflation for this year, I think, are five-tenths higher than they were in September. So, you’ve got—you had two months of higher inflation, September and October. As I mentioned, November is, is back on track. But, you know, once again we’ve, you know, we’ve had a year-end projection for inflation and it’s kind of fallen apart as we’ve approached the end of the year. So that is certainly a large factor in people’s thinking. I can tell you that might be the single biggest factor is inflation has once again underperformed relative to expectations. It’s still, you know, going to be between 2½ and 3 [percent]. It’s way below where it was. But, you know, we really want to see progress on inflation, to, to, you know, as I mentioned, as we think about further cuts, we’re going to be looking for progress on inflation. We have been moving sideways on 12-month inflation as the 12-month window moves. That’s in part because inflation was very, very low measured in, in the 4th quarter of 2023. Nonetheless, as we go forward, we’re going to want to be seeing further progress on bringing inflation down and keeping a solid labor market.","Q&A","Press Conf","","214","2024-12"
"2024-12-18","So I’ll say a couple things. First of all, when we, when we write— the thing we write down in the Summary of Economic Projections is the longer-run neutral rate, which is the neutral rate at a time when supply and demand are in balance, the full economy’s in balance, and no shocks are hitting the economy. That is not where we are right now. So when we’re making monetary policy at the Fed, that’s not the question we’re asking. So you can’t do a economy. And so what we’re doing in, in real time is we’re looking at our policy stance, and we’re looking at the way it’s hitting the economy, and, particularly, we look at the effects it’s having as we try to move the economy toward maximum employment and price stability. And the answer can be that there are things that affect the economy that are—that are lasting but not permanent. And the, the ones that are permanent are the ones that would be in r*. The ones that are, could be lasting, but, but nonetheless go away over time, they could actually affect what, what’s sort of technically the appropriate neutral stance in near term. So we’re looking at that, and, you know, we don’t—we don’t know exactly where it is, but as I like to say, we know it by its works, and I think what, what we know for sure is that we’re 100 basis points closer to it right now. There are many estimates of where that might be, and we know we’re a lot closer to it, and I think we’re in a good place. But I think from here it’s a new phase, and we’re going to be, you know, cautious about, about further cuts.","Q&A","Press Conf","","294","2024-12"
"2024-12-18","Yeah, I mean, honestly, we—you know, there are countless models of what—of what a neutral rate might be at any given time. There, there are empirical models, there are theoretical models, there are things that combine them, and they have as many different answers as you’d like. So there is no real certainty. And, I mean, it’s, it’s actually a good thing to know that we don’t know exactly where it is, so you’re not—you’re not tempted to think, “Oh, easier by the fact that, you know, that our policy works with long and variable lags. Nonetheless, that is the job we have, and so we’re, we’re— I think we need— it’s appropriate for us—for us now to proceed cautiously, now that we’re 100 basis points closer to, to neutral, and we’ll do so. Meanwhile, the economy seems to be in, in good shape, and these cuts will certainly help to support economic activity and the labor market while we can still make progress on inflation, because policy is still meaningfully restrictive.","Q&A","Press Conf","","172","2024-12"
"2024-12-18","So, and as, as I imagine you know, the, you know, the goal overall is headline inflation, because that’s what people experience. People don’t experience core inflation; they experience inflation, and that includes food and energy costs. So that’s the overall goal. But, as we know, headline inflation contains energy and food, and those prices can fluctuate for reasons that are not related to tightness in the economy and therefore are not really good predictors of future inflation. So it turns out that core inflation is, is a better predictor of overall inflation than overall inflation is. So we look at core inflation because it’s a better measure of what future inflation is like to be, likely to be, because it’s a better measure of, of","Q&A","Press Conf","","126","2024-12"

"2024-12-18","Yeah, so headline can, again, it can be affected by energy prices and food prices. So that, there, there will be things in, in the headline forecasts that are to do with forecasts of energy prices, whereas core will be—if, if you look at core going out a full year, then it’ll be much more driven by things like tightness in the economy. So it—that, that’s why the two can go in different directions. Headline has been lower, as you know, most of this year, but that’s because energy prices have been coming down, which is a great thing for people. But energy prices will come down, and then they will go up, and it won’t really be telling us anything about how tight the economy is and how, how future inflation will perform.","Q&A","Press Conf","","134","2024-12"

But the price of oil’s been coming down, and, for, because of supply conditions, global supply conditions. So we","Q&A","Press Conf","","111","2024-12"
"2024-12-18","So that’s, that’s not the—that’s not any decision that we’ve made at all. Let me explain “extent and timing.” So the, the sense of that wording is to make clear that if the economy does evolve about as anticipated, we’re at a point at which it would be appropriate to slow the pace of rate cuts. So “extent,” that just relates to how, how much further we can reduce our policy rate consistent with getting to a neutral stance. Clearly, that distance has shrunk by 100 basis points. So it’s significantly smaller. So that’s, that’s the “extent” question. “Timing” just suggests, again, that we’re at a place where we, we, assuming the economy develops as expected, we’re at or near a level that will make it appropriate to slow the pace of adjustments. So that, that’s what we mean by that. We’re not trying to make decisions about the longer run. You know, we are, we’re trying to make sensible policy as we go. And, you know, I just would emphasize the uncertainty, which is, it’s just—it’s just a function of the fact that, that we expect significant policy changes. There’s nothing really unusual about that. I think we need to, we need to see what they are and see what the effects they will have. We’ll, we’ll have a much clearer picture, I think, you know, when that happens.","Q&A","Press Conf","","230","2024-12"
"2024-12-18","So we’re—to, to cut further after this point, I, I would say it this way: We’ve reduced our policy rate now by 100 basis points. We’re significantly closer to neutral. At 4.3 percent and “change,” we believe policy is still meaningfully restrictive. But as for additional cuts, we’re going to be looking for further progress on inflation as well as continued strength in the labor market. And as long as the economy and the labor market are solid, we can be cautious about—as we consider further cuts. And all of that is reflected—to your question—in the December SEP, which shows a median forecast of down [to] two cuts next year, compared to four in September.","Q&A","Press Conf","","115","2024-12"

"2024-12-18","Well, so let, let me start by saying why we—why we cut today and then—and then move to 2025. So I would say today was a—was a closer call, but we decided it was the right call because we thought it was the best decision to foster achievement of both of our goals, maximum employment and price stability. We see the risks as two-sided: moving too slowly and needlessly undermine economic activity and the labor market, or move too quickly and needlessly undermine our progress on inflation. So we’re trying to steer between those two risks, and, on balance, we decided to go ahead with a further cut. And I, I’ll give you some details on why. orderly way. We don’t think we need further cooling in the labor market to get inflation down to 2 percent. Job creation is now well below the level or certainly below the level that would hold unemployment constant, the job-finding rate is low and declining, and other measures—such as surveys of workers and businesses, quits, things like that—broadly show a, a much cooler labor market than there was, than we had in 2019. It’s still quite gradually cooling. So we, we keep an eye on that. Inflation, we see that story as still broadly on track, and, and I’ll tell you why. We, we’ve made a great deal of progress. Twelve-month core inflation, as I mentioned, through November is estimated at 2.8 percent, down from a high of 5.6 percent. Twelve—but 12-month inflation has actually been moving sideways, as we are “lapping” very low readings of late last year. Housing services inflation actually is steadily coming down now, albeit at a slower pace than we might like, but it has now come down substantially and it is making progress, slower than hoped. And we, we’ve had recent high readings from nonmarket services and some bumpiness for goods. So I’ll just say, we, we—so remember that we couple this decision today with the “extent and timing” language in the postmeeting statement that signals that we are at or near a point at which it will be appropriate to slow the pace of further adjustments. You ask about 2025. I, I think that the lower—the slower pace of cuts for next year really reflects both the higher inflation readings we’ve had this year and the expectation that inflation will be higher. You saw in the SEP that risks and, and uncertainty around inflation we see as higher. Nonetheless, we, we see ourselves as, as still on track to continue to cut. I think the actual cuts that we make next year will not be because of anything we wrote down today.","Q&A","Press Conf","","446","2024-12"
"2024-12-18","We’re talking about—when you’re projecting the economy, you know, three years out, two years out, you’re talking about high uncertainty. Very high uncertainty. You know, we, we really—at that point it, it’s not, it’s not possible to confidently predict where the economy is going to be in three years. So what we’re doing is we’re looking at what’s happening now. And we’re kind of projecting that the same kinds of things are happening—so we, we keep a strong labor market, housing services inflation comes down, goods and services—goods inflation settles down, and, you know, nonmarket services return to their, their prior level. All of those things should happen over time, and, and, you know, those pieces come together. There’s every reason to think that they will. The timing of it is highly uncertain. You know, but you’re not wrong, though, that, you know, we’ve, the— it’s been a bit frustrating because the—while we’ve made progress, it has been slower than we had hoped. Nonetheless, we’re still on track. And, you know, I think if you’d—if two, two years ago, you’d said, “we were [going to be] at 4.2 percent unemployment and 2.8 percent inflation,” people would be, would say, “I’ll take that.” I mean, that, that’s a pretty good interim place to be. Job’s not done, but, but I think we’re, we’re feeling good about where we are and where we’re headed.","Q&A","Press Conf","","232","2024-12"
