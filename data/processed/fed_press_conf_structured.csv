"2019-10-04","Conference Call","Thanks for joining the videoconference today on such short notice.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I know that a number of us had to change plans to participate,","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I also want to thank the staff for going,","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","all out since the previous meeting to bring us to this point today,","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","when we can begin to consider a plan to get through near-term issues and from there to a stable longer-run equilibrium.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","We’re here to discuss the recent pressures in money markets,","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","the steps we’ve taken so far to address those pressures,","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","hence the need to meet today rather than wait for the next scheduled meeting at the end of October.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","As I noted in my email to you earlier this week,","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","we do not need to reach any formal decisions at this meeting.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","as you will see from the briefings,","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","we will need to reach consensus soon on a reasonable near-term plan and an associated communications strategy.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","there will be sufficient opportunity to weigh the options,","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","and work expeditiously to reach consensus.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","the story is a complicated one,","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","and there are many causal factors at work.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","So our plan will need to involve both measures to relieve pressures that are set to intensify in the near term as well as potential measures that improve liquidity conditions over time,","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","but that will take months of careful consideration before they can be decided on and implemented.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","Our main focus here today needs to be on the former:","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","measures to get us through the end of the year and through the April tax payment season,","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","If we can agree on the broad outlines of our approach at this meeting,","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I will ask the staff to develop specific plans and communications for us to review.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","One option is that we would discuss,","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","and vote at a That is three and a half weeks away.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","There are concerns that waiting that long runs the risk of being “behind the curve,” because markets have already figured this out by now.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","So that’s the plan for the meeting.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","If there are no questions on that,","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","then what we’ll do is go ahead and move to the briefings from Patricia,","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","Patricia, would you like to begin?","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","Since the decision in January 2019 to remain in an ample-reserves regime,","MS. ZOBEL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","the Committee has communicated that it is on a path toward the most efficient and effective level of reserves for that regime.","MS. ZOBEL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","This initially involved relatively rapid reductions in reserves through asset redemptions and growth in nonreserve liabilities.","MS. ZOBEL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","the Committee tapered asset redemptions,","MS. ZOBEL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","slowing the pace of reserve decline,","MS. ZOBEL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","the Committee ended redemptions entirely.","MS. ZOBEL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","Recent developments suggest that it may be appropriate for the FOMC to consider next steps in the process of transitioning to the efficient and effective level of reserves.","MS. ZOBEL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I’ll start with a review of what we learned in September and the effects of our operations on market conditions.","MS. ZOBEL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I’ll discuss the outlook for the remainder of the year and what market participants are expecting.","MS. ZOBEL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","Lorie will review some key tradeoffs bearing on options that the FOMC may consider to maintain reserve levels and provide greater assurances of interest rate control,","MS. ZOBEL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","overnight money market rates rose sharply the week of September 16,","MS. ZOBEL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","with contacts reporting poor liquidity and elevated uncertainty about funding market conditions.","MS. ZOBEL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","These developments also had spillover effects,","MS. ZOBEL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","with commercial paper rates and dollar borrowing costs in FX swaps rising notably.","MS. ZOBEL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","Treasury securities market liquidity in off-the-run securities deteriorated, and the Treasury cash-futures basis widened.","MS. ZOBEL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","While there had been some upward pressure in money markets on previous corporate tax payment dates,","MS. ZOBEL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","the magnitude of the moves in September was surprising.","MS. ZOBEL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","The staff analysis and market commentary has pointed to a confluence of factors related to the mid-September tax payment date and Treasury settlement.","MS. ZOBEL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","money fund lending in repo markets,","MS. ZOBEL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","which had been declining before mid- September,","MS. ZOBEL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","dropped sharply the week of September 16 as shown by the decline in sponsored lending volumes in the centrally cleared repo market in panel 2.","MS. ZOBEL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","The reduction in money fund repo lending resulted in a widening of the distribution of 1 The materials used by Mses.","MS. ZOBEL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","Zobel and Logan are appended to this transcript (appendix 1).","MS. ZOBEL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","sources of funding and were willing to pay substantially higher rates in order to finance positions.","MS. ZOBEL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","pressures in secured markets spilled over into unsecured markets and lenders pulled back from federal funds and Eurodollars out of caution about potential outflows related to tax payments or to lend at higher rates in repo.","MS. ZOBEL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","As shown in panel 4, FBOs and small domestic banks experienced notable outflows, while","MS. ZOBEL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","These larger institutions held reserves well above their lowest comfortable levels of reserves,","U.S"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","but didn’t increase lending in repo or in federal funds in response to higher rates.","U.S"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","Other banks that were close to their lowest comfortable levels of reserves paid significantly higher rates in unsecured markets to defend their reserve positions.","U.S"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","70 percent of federal funds volume consisted of SFOS panel banks whose reserve balances had fallen near or below their lowest comfortable level of reserves.","U.S"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","Funding markets in the past have been able to absorb similarly sized shocks associated with tax and Treasury settlement dates.","U.S"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","one lesson from this experience may be that,","U.S"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","against the backdrop of elevated Treasury debt issuance and declining reserves,","U.S"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","smaller shocks can have more pronounced effects on markets.","U.S"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","Internal risk limits and balance sheet costs seem to play a role in slowing the distribution of liquidity across the system and amplifying the shock,","U.S"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","as financial institutions require high spreads to intermediate.","U.S"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","A second lesson is that a higher level of reserves may be needed to accommodate distributional frictions in reserve markets.","U.S"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","Some banks have elevated demand for reserves on days of high expected outflows,","U.S"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","and even those that have surplus reserves may choose not to lend to other firms even at higher rates.","U.S"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","In order to help maintain the federal funds rate within the target range,","U.S"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","the Desk conducted large-scale repo operations starting on September 17.","U.S"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","These played an important role in calming markets and improving funding market conditions.","U.S"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","The addition of term operations helped provide assurances to market participants about funding markets over quarter-end.","U.S"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","participation in the Desk’s overnight and term operations added $203 billion of reserves,","U.S"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","September quarter-end conditions were stable,","U.S"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","although rates were still somewhat elevated relative to recent quarter-end dates.","U.S"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","Some of the higher repo rates passed through to the federal funds market,","U.S"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","and the distribution of rates traded in federal funds was wider than normal.","U.S"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","market participants have expressed uncertainty about how funding market conditions may evolve after the currently announced open market operations (OMOs) roll off.","U.S"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","As shown in the table in the Appendix,","U.S"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","the Desk’s three term operations will mature by October 11,","U.S"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","and the overnight operations will also expire.","U.S"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","Market participants are also concerned about funding market conditions Forward measures of money market rates through year-end indicate expectations that pressures may build between now and December.","U.S"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","Term repo rates remain somewhat elevated relative to overnight index swaps,","U.S"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","and indicative pricing in repo markets for the year-end has been between 3 and 4 percent.","U.S"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","Nearly all money market analysts expect permanent open market operations to be announced at the October meeting.","U.S"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","Several of these analysts have indicated initial purchases are likely to be larger than purchases needed to offset organic growth in nonreserve liabilities in order to maintain reserves at current or higher levels.","U.S"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","Analysts expect the size of these purchases to be around $225 billion,","U.S"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","though estimates range from below $200 billion to as high as $400 billion.","U.S"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","Expectations are split as to whether these purchases would be concentrated in Treasury bills,","U.S"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I’ll turn it over to Lorie to discuss options the FOMC may consider.","U.S"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I’ll be referring to exhibit 2.","MS. LOGAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","recent developments suggest that it’s appropriate to consider next steps in the transition process to the most efficient and effective level of reserves.","MS. LOGAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","one step the Committee could consider is directing the Desk to maintain reserve levels similar to the average level in early September.","MS. LOGAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","This would entail operations to maintain the reserves created through recent operations and offset future growth of nonreserve liabilities.","MS. LOGAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","the Desk could execute overnight repo operations each day through year-end to provide a shock absorber to support control of the federal funds rate in addition to maintaining reserves similar to the early September average.","MS. LOGAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","These two steps could provide more assurance of rate control as the Committee considers longer-run strategies to maintain an ample-reserves regime,","MS. LOGAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","which might include considerations relevant to reducing reserve demand or the establishment of a standing repo facility.","MS. LOGAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","My briefing today centers on how to reduce the risk of volatility in funding markets over the near term while providing time for the Committee to consider these longer-term issues.","MS. LOGAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","If the Committee wishes to maintain reserve levels close to,","MS. LOGAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","those that prevailed in early September,","MS. LOGAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","a fairly sizable amount of open market operations would be required.","MS. LOGAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","The actions taken by the Desk to address pressures in money markets over the second half of September lifted reserve levels by around $100 billion on average during the latter half of the month to just above $1.4 trillion.","MS. LOGAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","Absent further open market operations, reserves will decline significantly over coming months.","MS. LOGAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","The staff estimate that the SOMA would likely need to increase by at least $250 billion by the end of 2019 and by more than $350 billion to maintain a similar level of reserves through April of next year.","MS. LOGAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","Our current forecast of reserves is shown in grey in panel 7.","MS. LOGAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","two illustrative scenarios using both Treasury bill purchases and term repos are presented to maintain reserve levels around $1.45 trillion,","MS. LOGAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","the average relate to communications and the capacity of the market to smoothly absorb these operations.","MS. LOGAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","In the first scenario shown in panel 7,","MS. LOGAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","Treasury securities are purchased in the secondary market at a faster pace.","MS. LOGAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","This quicker pace of purchases means there is somewhat less reliance on repo operations to add reserves,","MS. LOGAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","which might improve the intermediation of reserves by relying less on primary dealers that may face balance constraints to do repo,","MS. LOGAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","The advantage of relying more heavily on outright purchases is that the Treasury market is deep and liquid,","MS. LOGAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","and can absorb a fairly high volume of transactions.","MS. LOGAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","Outright purchases also lay a permanent base of reserves,","MS. LOGAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","which can reduce the size of operations needed to maintain reserve levels in the future.","MS. LOGAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","we assumed purchases of Treasury bills of around $60 billion per month,","MS. LOGAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","which could make a significant contribution toward filling the reserve need by year-end.","MS. LOGAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","We will learn more about the capacity of the Treasury market to absorb our operations through experience and could find that we are comfortably able to purchase more than this amount or possibly somewhat less.","MS. LOGAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I should note that the addition of a broader “universe” of Treasury securities,","MS. LOGAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","such as those notes and bonds having only a few years to maturity,","MS. LOGAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","would likely add to the capacity.","MS. LOGAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","Now, Treasury security purchases do have some drawbacks.","MS. LOGAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","Large purchases of Treasury securities might have some chance of being conflated with quantitative easing,","MS. LOGAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","particularly by a broader audience that is less familiar with the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet.","MS. LOGAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","Purchasing Treasury bills may reduce this association,","MS. LOGAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","because they are money market instruments with limited duration and doing so would not materially change the quantity of duration in the private sector’s hands or the total term premium effect of the SOMA portfolio,","MS. LOGAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","However, to the broader public, this distinction might not be apparent.","MS. LOGAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","relies more heavily on repo market operations to achieve the desired level of reserves.","MS. LOGAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","Repo operations have been successful at restoring calm in money markets in recent weeks,","MS. LOGAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","As such, repo would be an important component of any plan.","MS. LOGAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","However, there are important limitations of repo operations, particularly around year-end.","MS. LOGAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","Operating in the repo market depends heavily on primary dealer balance sheet capacity and willingness to intermediate to the broader market.","MS. LOGAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","As dealers manage their balance sheets closely into year-end,","MS. LOGAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","they may have less capacity to take up large amounts of term repo and lend this onward because of these constraints.","MS. LOGAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","a greater reliance on term operations may make it somewhat more difficult to achieve the reserve level objective.","MS. LOGAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","we use the September quarter-end experience as a guide to how much term repo can be sustained.","MS. LOGAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","Overnight repo operations could supplement these term operations,","MS. LOGAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","We cannot estimate with assurance how much overnight take-up we might see,","MS. LOGAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","so they’re not shown in the panel.","MS. LOGAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","the communications, and then purchase higher levels of securities heading into year- end.","MS. LOGAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","Higher levels of purchases in December may be more easily explained as associated with the year-end downdraft in reserves and balance sheet constraints.","MS. LOGAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","it may take some time to maintain reserves near or above the levels that prevailed in early September.","MS. LOGAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","Faster purchases or higher repo take-up could help achieve the objective sooner,","MS. LOGAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","but it may still take some time.","MS. LOGAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","As the Desk works toward maintaining reserve levels,","MS. LOGAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","it seems appropriate to maintain overnight repo operations in order to provide a cushion against rate volatility that might occur and to enhance market participants’ confidence.","MS. LOGAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","The Desk would expect to offer $75 billion in overnight repos,","MS. LOGAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","However, the parameters of these operations could be adjusted if conditions warrant.","IOER"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","the minimum bid rate could be adjusted higher if take-up in the operations warranted and bid rates were settling near the minimum bid rate.","IOER"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","if higher pressures were expected,","IOER"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","the offering size could be increased and the minimum bid rate lowered.","IOER"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","Before concluding, I want to make one near-term note on the current repo operations.","IOER"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","we made one adjustment to the planned repo operations in the draft Desk statement we circulated to the Committee in advance of this meeting.","IOER"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","To maintain continuity with the current amount of outstanding term repo and based upon feedback from counterparties,","IOER"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","we will modestly increase the offering sizes of the term operations through November 4.","IOER"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","This Desk statement outlining the continuation of overnight and term operations is slated for release after today’s meeting.","IOER"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","These operations are consistent with the domestic policy directive to the Desk that the Committee adopted at its previous meeting and do not require Committee action at this meeting.","IOER"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I’ll now turn it over to Thomas, who will discuss related communications issues.","IOER"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I will be referring to the handout “Material for the Briefing on Communications Considerations regarding Plans for Open Market Operations.” If the Committee were to agree on a plan for the growth of its Treasury securities holdings as well as repo operations over the rest of this year and into next,","MR. LAUBACH"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","it may wish to issue a statement to communicate this decision to the public.","MR. LAUBACH"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","Depending on the timing of your decision,","MR. LAUBACH"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","you could issue this statement following your regularly scheduled October meeting or well before then.","MR. LAUBACH"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","you may want to issue this statement separately from your regular postmeeting statement to emphasize that these balance sheet decisions are distinct from the choice of the policy stance.","MR. LAUBACH"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","Regarding the timing of this statement,","MR. LAUBACH"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","announcing your decisions before the October meeting would provide more time for Treasury security 2 The materials used by Mr.","MR. LAUBACH"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","Laubach are appended to this transcript (appendix 2).","MR. LAUBACH"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","and as of earlier this week most market participants didn’t seem to expect an announcement about reserve maintenance purchases before October 30.","MR. LAUBACH"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","Turning to the possible content of such a statement:","MR. LAUBACH"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","You could highlight the continuity and consistency of your decision with previous communications by referring to your January 2019 decision that you intend to maintain an ample supply of reserves so that control over the federal funds rate and other short-term interest rates is exercised primarily through the setting of administered rates.","MR. LAUBACH"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","One important consideration in formulating such a statement is how you would describe the level of reserves you wish to maintain over time.","MR. LAUBACH"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","The options that Lorie presented are predicated on the view that,","MR. LAUBACH"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","in light of the experience of recent weeks,","MR. LAUBACH"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","it is prudent to maintain a level of reserves at or moderately above those prevailing in early September,","MR. LAUBACH"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","before the sharp decline around the middle of the month.","MR. LAUBACH"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","Communicating this intention would provide assurance to market participants that your operations will be sufficiently large to prevent reserves from running much below $1.5 trillion.","MR. LAUBACH"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","Another consideration is how specific to be about the mix and size of outright purchases and of term and overnight repo operations.","MR. LAUBACH"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","One approach would be to state that you will be conducting outright purchases and term repo operations as necessary to achieve and maintain your desired level of reserves,","MR. LAUBACH"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","you will continue to offer overnight repo operations to lower the risk of money market pressures that could adversely affect the implementation of monetary policy.","MR. LAUBACH"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","Specific amounts for the pace of outright purchases and the size and other terms of term and overnight repo operations could then be announced by the Desk and adjusted over time if needed.","MR. LAUBACH"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","in light of the uncertainty surrounding the level of reserves most consistent with efficient and effective implementation,","MR. LAUBACH"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","it might well be prudent to emphasize that you will continue to monitor money market developments as you assess what that level is,","MR. LAUBACH"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","and that you stand ready to adjust the details of these plans as necessary.","MR. LAUBACH"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","That completes our prepared remarks, and we’ll be happy to answer questions.","MR. LAUBACH"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","If you’re on camera, you could raise your hand, and Jim will take down names.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","We have some who are just calling in.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","So while we’re doing that, this is the time for questions for the briefers.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I’ll ask folks who are just calling in on the phone and not here by camera, including—why don’t we start with you, Esther, if you have any questions.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","Do you want me to ask it now or wait?","MS. GEORGE"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","So, Lorie, my question, when you talk about under either options that it could take some time to reach the desired level, do you have an estimate?","MS. GEORGE"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","How do you think about what that time frame is?","MS. GEORGE"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","So the time frame that we show in the two illustrative examples, using a combination of the two tools we discussed—the term repos and the purchases—would take about a month to reach those levels.","MS. LOGAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","But, again, these are just illustrative, and they depend importantly on the date at which the purchases or the term repos would begin, as well as the overall size.","MS. LOGAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","And so that time can be shortened or lengthened, depending on the tradeoffs that the Committee discusses today regarding the two tools.","MS. LOGAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","But it sounds like you’re talking about a matter of weeks.","MS. GEORGE"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","We wouldn’t be thinking about that in the context of an extended period.","MS. GEORGE"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","As in the illustrative examples we’ve shown,","MS. LOGAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I think at the beginning it’s weeks,","MS. LOGAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","in the second illustrative example as well as the top,","MS. LOGAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","there are other periods over the course of these three months when the combination of those two tools still leaves reserves a little bit short of that objective.","MS. LOGAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","it’s important to note that the overnight repos would also be available,","MS. LOGAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","and so they’re not shown on these charts because we don’t know for sure what the take-up would be.","MS. LOGAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","we could expect that those reserve levels will probably be above those in later parts of the forecast,","MS. LOGAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","That’s all I had, Mr. Chairman.","MS. GEORGE"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","Just one question, with respect to clarification.","MR. QUARLES"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","So I think I understood from the briefing that a significant problem in continuing with ad hoc operations until we could make,","MR. QUARLES"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","more permanent changes that may be affecting incentives for the market but as a way of addressing the current shortfall,","MR. QUARLES"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I think I understood that that had to do with the capacity of the balance sheets of the counterparties as to why we thought those ad hoc operations might be—that that might be an unsustainable way to proceed.","MR. QUARLES"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","So am I correct about that as to that being a problem,","MR. QUARLES"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","as well as the length of time we might be doing that,","MR. QUARLES"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","that could be perceived as undermining our commitment to an ample-reserves regime?","MR. QUARLES"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","And then I have a question—that is,","MR. QUARLES"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","one of the things that has been thought about for the longer term—and although we’re talking about the shorter term today,","MR. QUARLES"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I just wanted to make sure that I understand this as well,","MR. QUARLES"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","because it does affect a little bit how I think what we ought to do in the shorter term.","MR. QUARLES"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","is that an element of—a longer-term response could be the implementation of a kind of a standing repo facility,","MR. QUARLES"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","which I had understood would be kind of an Eddie Murphy–Dan Aykroyd in Trading Places—you know,","MR. QUARLES"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","We’ll take them all.” And is that the case?","MR. QUARLES"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","And if that’s the case as to what the repo facility would be,","MR. QUARLES"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","how does it work that’s different from these ad hoc operations,","MR. QUARLES"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","which might be limited by the capacity of the counterparties?","MR. QUARLES"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","in terms of the temporary repo market operations,","MS. LOGAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I think you raised two important points.","MS. LOGAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","One of the limitations of the temporary open market operations that we discussed is related to the balance sheet constraints that you were talking on to other market participants—that does gross up their balance sheet.","MS. LOGAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","And particularly as we’re moving into your end,","MS. LOGAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","we’ve heard from them already that they would be unlikely to do that sort of intermediation that they started to do in these early days of September.","MS. LOGAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","but probably not to the degree that they have been doing it.","MS. LOGAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","So we do see this intermediation and balance sheet constraint as a key limitation of the temporary open market operations.","MS. LOGAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I think the second point you raised about the commitment—you know,","MS. LOGAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I do think that market participants have a view that purchases are more in line with the ample-reserves regime in terms of the permanent base of reserves that would be maintained.","MS. LOGAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","But that’s not a theme that we’ve been hearing a lot about right now,","MS. LOGAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I would say the other consideration and limitation of using temporary open market operations,","MS. LOGAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","as you can see in the forecast,","MS. LOGAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","sometimes the increase in nonreserve liabilities and,","MS. LOGAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","the drop in reserves can be quite large and very swift.","MS. LOGAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","And if you use permanent purchases to get ahead of that so that there’s a buffer,","MS. LOGAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","then we’re more likely to be able to maintain that minimum level of reserves.","MS. LOGAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","If you rely just on the temporary open market operations to fill that gap in those periods that you can see in gray,","MS. LOGAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","we might not have the capacity,","MS. LOGAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","it’s a very sudden shift in the Federal Reserve’s operations with the private sector to try to fill that large of a hole in that short amount of time.","MS. LOGAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","there are three types of constraints we’re talking about with the temporary open market operations:","MS. LOGAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","the commitment to the ample-reserves regime,","MS. LOGAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","though I don’t think that’s been in play in the short run;","MS. LOGAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","President Kaplan—and I’ll ask people in the room as well—any questions before we begin the opportunity for comment?","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","The only question is for Lorie,","MR. KAPLAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","and I think I know your view on this—I assume you would assert that the “faster” approach versus the “slower” approach gives you greater confidence that we would meet the objective of returning to the early September reserves target and put us in the best position to deal with year-end demands,","MR. KAPLAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","that the faster approach would give you more confidence we’ll achieve those objectives than the slower approach?","MR. KAPLAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","From a purely operational perspective, as we noted in the memo, I think the first illustrative example would, of course, give us more confidence of being able to maintain that level of reserves.","MS. LOGAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","But also as discussed in the memos, there are important tradeoffs that the Committee would need to make, related to communications and whether the broader public might interpret those larger purchases at the beginning as potential quantitative easing (QE).","MS. LOGAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","And I think that’s a broader tradeoff for the Committee to consider.","MS. LOGAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","But from a purely operational perspective, the first illustrative example would give us more confidence.","MS. LOGAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","but I think Governor Quarles also asked you about the temporary versus the standing repo facility and how to think about that,","MS. BRAINARD"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","and I thought that was an important question.","MS. BRAINARD"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","Lorie, I don’t know if you want to come back in on that.","MS. BRAINARD"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","October on the idea of a standing repo facility.","MS. BRAINARD"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","First, I think we have learned that the repo operations generally are effective.","MS. BRAINARD"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","and they have calmed markets through the use of a repo-type operation.","MS. BRAINARD"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","This wasn’t a standing facility but had some similar features that,","MS. BRAINARD"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","that there is not perfect pass-through from the type of counterparties that we have.","MS. BRAINARD"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","Currently, we rely on primary dealers involved in that, those repo operations.","MS. BRAINARD"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","And as we discussed in answer to the question from Governor Quarles,","MS. BRAINARD"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","those dealer balance sheets are not fully elastic,","MS. BRAINARD"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","and so the pass-through and intermediation is not very smooth.","MS. BRAINARD"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","There are some frictions there.","MS. BRAINARD"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","the dealers that are coming into our operations and then on-lending are charging quite a bit of a spread to those who don’t have access to the operations.","MS. BRAINARD"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","The other thing I think we have learned through this process—not specific to the open market operations,","MS. BRAINARD"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","but to the money market conditions more broadly—is that we did see that 15 banks did borrow in federal funds or unsecured markets at rates above the discount rate.","MS. BRAINARD"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","there is stigma associated with the discount window that we can evidently see.","MS. BRAINARD"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","And I think it would be important,","MS. BRAINARD"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","when designing a standing repo facility,","MS. BRAINARD"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","to consider what type of restrictions or communications surround it,","MS. BRAINARD"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","so that that type of stigma wouldn’t also apply to this facility.","MS. BRAINARD"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","So I think issues regarding the counterparties that would be appropriate for a permanent standing repo facility would be an important discussion in October—the appropriate rates as well","MS. BRAINARD"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","No one so far has visibly raised his or her hand.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I guess the first one starts from the options for communications,","MR. EVANS"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","which highlights that we can “highlight continuity with our January 2019 decision to maintain an ample supply of reserves so that control over the federal funds rate and other short-term interest rates is exercised primarily through the setting of administered rates.” That got my attention,","MR. EVANS"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","because I know that we have talked about administered rates being the focal point for how we establish the federal funds rate within our target range.","MR. EVANS"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","it seems that’s highly dependent on the level of reserves that we have,","MR. EVANS"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","because as we have had to move the interest rate on excess reserves (IOER) lower into the target range,","MR. EVANS"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","the funds rate is trading above that,","MR. EVANS"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","and the IOER rate and the overnight reverse repurchase (ON RRP) rate are lower than that.","MR. EVANS"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","And it seems that it’s more money market arbitrage that is determining the funds rate.","MR. EVANS"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","If we really wanted—so I’m a little concerned about highlighting administered rates there.","MR. EVANS"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","That’s one part of the question.","MR. EVANS"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","But the other one would be, it seems quite related to the size of reserves.","MR. EVANS"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","If we had greater levels of reserves so that it is the arbitrage for the administered rates,","MR. EVANS"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","then it could be consistent with this point.","MR. EVANS"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","Is there some relationship between the level of reserves and the emphasis on administered rates?","MR. EVANS"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I mean, that’s a combination of questions maybe for Thomas and the Desk.","MR. EVANS"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","that the federal funds rate is trading reliably within the target range.","MR. EVANS"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I don’t necessarily see a strict relationship there between the level of the federal funds rate and the level of the administered rates.","MR. EVANS"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","So if you have a mechanism by which you set the administered rates and the federal funds rate—for example,","MR. EVANS"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","trades above the administered rates—but you have firm control of the federal funds rate within the target range,","MR. EVANS"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","that would seem to me to be one version that is consistent with what you expressed,","MR. EVANS"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","as you move the administered rates,","MR. EVANS"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","the federal funds rate is really closely tied to them.","MR. EVANS"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","a situation in which you have signs of reserve scarcity,","MR. EVANS"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","then you have high-frequency fluctuations in factors affecting reserve supply,","MR. EVANS"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","like the things we have seen with tax dates,","MR. EVANS"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","And then what you might see is that,","MR. EVANS"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","the link between your administered rates and the federal funds rate becomes a lot more volatile.","MR. EVANS"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","And so that might be the situation that I would interpret your statement as indicating you wanted to avoid.","MR. EVANS"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","Lorie or Patricia, I don’t know if you have thoughts.","MR. EVANS"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I think that all sounds right.","MS. ZOBEL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I think the only thing that we would add is that,","MS. ZOBEL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","we have seen a relationship emerging,","MS. ZOBEL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","between changes in the reserves supply and changes in the federal funds rate.","MS. ZOBEL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","we saw a lower degree of that relationship—and rates that were more centered and more stable above the IOER rate.","MS. ZOBEL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","And there was less dispersion in the federal funds and Eurodollar markets than we saw over the course of the summer and,","MS. ZOBEL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I think we saw a little bit of that relationship emerging, and then, most","MS. ZOBEL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","If I could ask a second question—the communications memo points to us talking about early September levels of reserves—the documents are prepared.","MR. EVANS"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","So I guess my question is, early September size of reserve balances—that’s a focal point.","MR. EVANS"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I’m trying to be careful here.","MR. EVANS"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I’m not asking anybody for what they think of as the optimal size of reserves or anything,","MR. EVANS"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","but it seemed to be a focal point from a time when things were working a little bit better.","MR. EVANS"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I went back and thought a little bit about some other levels of reserves that have been mentioned.","MR. EVANS"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","So back in December 2018, at the FOMC meeting, there was a presentation.","MR. EVANS"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","And it was just mentioned that the level of reserves at that time,","MR. EVANS"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","if we had sort of stopped reducing the runoff,","MR. EVANS"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","would have been $1.74 trillion,","MR. EVANS"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","and we shouldn’t have any difficulties with how money markets are functioning.","MR. EVANS"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","That’s well north of where we are, so I guess that’s not so surprising.","MR. EVANS"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","The early September number is about $1.45 trillion.","MR. EVANS"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","we had a presentation in which we talked about the Senior Financial Officer Survey estimates of comfortable levels of reserves and aggregated those—a little under $900 billion,","MR. EVANS"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","was what they were pointing to.","MR. EVANS"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","There were uncertainties associated with those estimated,","MR. EVANS"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","a couple of buffers were added on top of that,","MR. EVANS"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","and I think we got to what was supposed to be a pretty comfortable level of reserves—$1.1 trillion—or maybe it was $1.2 trillion,","MR. EVANS"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","but it’s pretty far south from where we are.","MR. EVANS"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","And that was our best thinking at the time.","MR. EVANS"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","we’re learning about the markets,","MR. EVANS"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","there’s good reason to think that that was a good market functioning should be pretty good if we were going to go that route.","MR. EVANS"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I’m just trying to figure out these other kinds of levels.","MR. EVANS"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","the focus that we took was to return reserve levels to early September,","MS. LOGAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","but also to combine that with the use of overnight RPs as a backstop.","MS. LOGAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","And we think that combination over these next three months will reduce volatility in money markets.","MS. LOGAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","it will provide time for the Committee,","MS. LOGAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","to make longer- term assessments—like the ones you’re raising,","MS. LOGAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","President Evans—about what the appropriate efficient and effective level of reserves is.","MS. LOGAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","we can go back to some of those historical experiences and do more analysis about the type of relationships that Patricia was talking about.","MS. LOGAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","And we can think more deeply about the shape of the aggregate reserves demand curve and the type of distributional frictions that we saw.","MS. LOGAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","And it also gives the Committee time to think about some longer-run strategies about a standing repo facility or changes in other nonreserve liabilities or overall incentives to affect the demand for reserves.","MS. LOGAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","So our focus, really, here in the memo was on the next three months.","MS. LOGAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","And in the context of the next three months,","MS. LOGAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I think that returning to that level is what is feasible in combination with the overnight RP and will give the Committee time to discuss these issues in more detail.","MS. LOGAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","President Evans, if I might just add, from the perspective of communications, you may, therefore, also want to emphasize that this number or the level that","MR. LAUBACH"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I guess my first question is for Lorie, which piggybacks on Charlie’s question.","MR. KASHKARI"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I just want to make sure that I’m understanding the very basics of this.","MR. KASHKARI"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","If I look at the forecast, if we do what you’re proposing but we don’t do anything else, in April you would expect to see rates spike again.","MR. KASHKARI"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","So we’re buying ourselves four or five months, something like that?","MR. KASHKARI"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","If you look at panel 7, as I just mentioned, the focus of the memo and the work is on the next three months.","MS. LOGAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","And during that time the Committee would have more time to discuss the appropriate approach to think about the first quarter of 2020.","MS. LOGAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","We wanted to show, though, this longer horizon in the forecast so that you could get a sense of how the decisions being made in the short run would affect that second quarter and into the April period.","MS. LOGAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I thought the staff was being too conservative in your “buffers on top of your buffers.” Pretty clearly,","MR. KASHKARI"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","if we’re going to do something somewhat extraordinary,","MR. KASHKARI"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","do we want now to build in more of a buffer and just make sure that we don’t have any hiccups or surprises,","MR. KASHKARI"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","And so my question is—and we can talk about it later in the actual go-round—do we need to have more of a buffer if we’re going to do something extraordinary right now than what appears to be in the proposal?","MR. KASHKARI"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","So that’s just kind of a comment.","MR. KASHKARI"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","policy, we’re talking about the implementation of monetary policy.","MR. KASHKARI"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","Is it remotely possible that this could be a Desk communication,","MR. KASHKARI"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","which would turn the heat down a little bit and put more focus on “this is just technical details of how we implement policy,” so that there’s less confusion that the FOMC is changing its stance of policy?","MR. KASHKARI"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I was looking here at your trusty general counsel.","MR. LAUBACH"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I think that a very expansive reading of “open market operations” would also include outright expansion of your outright holdings.","MR. LAUBACH"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","it feels like this is a sufficiently significant step that it would be surprising and might raise questions about whether this was a unilateral Desk decision that I would see advantages to having a communication that would clarify that,","MR. LAUBACH"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","this was actually a Committee decision.","MR. LAUBACH"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","So my question, I guess, piggybacks off both President Evans and President Kashkari.","MS. DALY"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I don’t want to put too much weight on it,","MS. DALY"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","but we do seem to be hovering around “Let’s get it back to September.” But we’ve been—as Patricia briefed us,","MS. DALY"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","we started to see some movement,","MS. DALY"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","some volatility that might have been a warning sign all the way back in March.","MS. DALY"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","when we’re communicating about building reserves back up to get through the next several months,","MS. DALY"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","do we really need to put a date at which we’re targeting it,","MS. DALY"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","we’re also going to learn about what the appropriate amount of reserves is to operate effectively and I guess,","MS. DALY"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I will defer to Lorie in terms of, you know, how market participants might view the early September level as a focal point.","MR. LAUBACH"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","It seems to me that what would be helpful is some clarity—you know, what your purchases over the coming months are trying to achieve.","MR. LAUBACH"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","So if you just indicated, for example, a monthly pace, that may leave a little more uncertainty as to what you are willing to provide.","MR. LAUBACH"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I agree with Thomas that providing the sense of early September gives the market a focal point for what we’re trying to achieve over the shorter- run period.","MS. LOGAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I think that would be associated with communications about continued discussion that the Committee would be having on the efficient and effective level of reserves.","MS. LOGAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","In terms of market expectations,","MS. LOGAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","in terms of the level of reserves the Committee would choose to maintain over some longer horizon.","MS. LOGAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","We’ve only seen a few market participants give a figure along those lines.","MS. LOGAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I think most of the discussion that we’ve seen in the market is focused on a near-term issue,","MS. LOGAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","and there’s a general understanding that the longer- run level of reserves that the Committee would deem to be efficient and effective would be influenced by other policies.","MS. LOGAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","And there’s some expectation that there’s going to be discussion of a standing repo facility or other policies that could affect the overall demand for reserves of individual institutions.","MS. LOGAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","the communications about the near term is what the market will focus on,","MS. LOGAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","they’ll start making broader predictions or expectations about where the Committee is heading over a period that goes beyond the end of the year.","MS. LOGAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","So, Lorie, and maybe Thomas, is there a reason that you’re focusing on the date, early September, rather than telling the markets the level you’re doing?","MS. MESTER"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","Is that because you don’t want to associate a level—because you may change the level later on?","MS. MESTER"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I think there was a sense that, from a communications perspective, there was some benefit in focusing on returning to a level before these events took place, but not being so precise at this point.","MS. LOGAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I think what they will do is look at the H.4.1 numbers from the first and the second week of September,","MS. LOGAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","and I think they will begin to communicate that it’s a level of $1.45 trillion based on that information.","MS. LOGAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","Really, that’s a communications decision for the Committee and an important discussion point for today.","MS. LOGAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","there’s one issue about this level,","VICE CHAIR WILLIAMS"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","When you talk about a level of a certain dollar amount,","VICE CHAIR WILLIAMS"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","it sounds like we’re targeting that level,","VICE CHAIR WILLIAMS"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","and when you think about using temporary open market operations,","VICE CHAIR WILLIAMS"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","you really can’t think about targeting the level of reserves when you’re relying on those open market operations.","VICE CHAIR WILLIAMS"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","the take-up of those operations depends on the circumstances at that point in time.","VICE CHAIR WILLIAMS"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","we can easily see the amount of reserves,","VICE CHAIR WILLIAMS"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","inclusive of the open-market operations,","VICE CHAIR WILLIAMS"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","So there’s a communications issue about,","VICE CHAIR WILLIAMS"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","is supply a level of reserves into the system and consistent with the level of reserves that we’ve seen in early","VICE CHAIR WILLIAMS"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I think it’s also just worth highlighting the fact—which is important from an operational perspective and in how we would go about implementation—that the goal is to supply sufficient reserves so that you’re consistently above that level.","MS. LOGAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","On average, the amount that we would be supplying would be above that.","MS. LOGAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","And then that gets into an earlier question about how big a buffer the Committee would like to have to allow for those changes in nonreserve liabilities that then bring you back down.","MS. LOGAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","this is meant to communicate a minimum level that we would be aiming to supply reserves above.","MS. LOGAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","Any further questions before we begin our opportunity for—","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","President Rosengren, I see you now.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I actually have two questions.","MR. ROSENGREN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","The first question gets to the word “efficient.” I was thinking that “efficient amount of reserves” referred to the amount of reserves necessary so that we didn’t have to do overnight or term repos (RPs).","MR. ROSENGREN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","And this memo seems to have a different definition of what “efficient” is that somehow allows both term and overnight RPs to go up or down,","MR. ROSENGREN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","sometimes by fairly substantial amounts.","MR. ROSENGREN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","So it would be useful to get a clearer definition of whether “efficient” means we don’t have to do overnight and term RPs and our balance sheet is sufficiently large that we don’t have to do that,","MR. ROSENGREN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","or—what is the alternative definition to what “efficient” means?","MR. ROSENGREN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","if we think “efficient” is actually trying to avoid doing all this intervention by the Markets Group on a more regular basis,","MR. ROSENGREN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","how many bills and notes could we buy over a relatively short period to expand our balance sheet so that we don’t have as much purchase of bills,","MR. ROSENGREN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","in order to get up to a higher level,","MR. ROSENGREN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","what would the quantity be that would start becoming disruptive?","MR. ROSENGREN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I’ll try and do the first one, and, Lorie, maybe you could take the second.","MR. LAUBACH"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","The communications that you issued in January actually do not exactly refer to an efficient and effective level,","MR. LAUBACH"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","have this important clause that,","MR. LAUBACH"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","you would like to be in a position in which active management of the supply of reserves is not required.","MR. LAUBACH"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","Arguably, what the Desk is currently doing, with its heroic efforts, is pretty active.","MR. LAUBACH"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","you would like your securities holdings to be sufficiently large that operations of this sort should be an exception—and not an ongoing activity.","MR. LAUBACH"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","just in terms of the memo itself,","MS. LOGAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","our focus was on the transition over these three months and not to define the steady state—which is where Thomas focused in his comments.","MS. LOGAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","in the memo we proposed $60 billion of bills per month in the illustrative scenario 1.","MS. LOGAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","Based on some analysis that we’ve done looking at changes in the supply of Treasury securities when the Treasury has needed to move the bill supply up and down fairly rapidly,","MS. LOGAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","for reasons related to the debt ceiling,","MS. LOGAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","we’ve gained some experience about the amount of bill supply in the short run that wouldn’t affect market functioning.","MS. LOGAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","but we think to start somewhere around $60 billion,","MS. LOGAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","is where we’d feel comfortable from a market-functioning perspective.","MS. LOGAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","short coupon securities or even a little bit further out along the Treasury curve to get to a total of maybe $80 billion per month or a little above $80 billion over a one-month horizon.","MS. LOGAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","from an initial starting place,","MS. LOGAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","that’s where we’d feel comfortable from a market-functioning perspective.","MS. LOGAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","Before we go on to President Barkin,","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","can I just follow up on President Rosengren’s question?","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","Maybe you answered this and I didn’t get it,","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","but—let’s say we’re at the end of April next year,","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","and we have the level of reserves that is shown in the top panel in picture 7,","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","and that we’re growing organically from there.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","What would be our expectation going forward for the next 12 months, let’s say?","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","Would we then be able to look at the language that Thomas read and believe that we have a level of reserves such that we do not expect to be using open market operations to manage interest rates?","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","Would we be satisfying that language at that time,","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","or would we still be short of it?","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","In terms of the projection that we’re showing through the end of the year, as I mentioned earlier, the amount we’re trying to fill by the end of 2019 was $250 billion.","MS. LOGAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","We would need to fill another $100 billion before April 2020.","MS. LOGAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","That would be inclusive of thinking about organic growth during that period, but organic growth purchases over the course of a year would probably average around $15 billion to $20 billion per month generally.","MS. LOGAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","But, in this first part, there’s an amount that’s needed well above that average organic growth over the course of the year.","MS. LOGAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","$100 billion for the April period, and then after that you would grow, on average, whatever we determine to be that organic growth number.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","My question really is, standing there on April 30 with that amount of reserves, do we believe we’re in an ample-reserves regime, as we have defined it?","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","Or do we believe that we’ll still need to be doing intermittent repo and things?","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I think the focus that this projection is based on is the idea of limiting volatility over this short-run period: targeting a minimum level of reserves from early September plus the overnight operations.","MS. LOGAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","The longer-run level of reserves,","MS. LOGAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","such that you are relying purely on purchases,","MS. LOGAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","but would importantly depend on the Committee’s discussions about whether to maintain a standing repo facility or to take other actions to reduce nonreserve liabilities or changes in policy related to the demand for reserves.","MS. LOGAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I think that question would need to be in the context of those longer-term questions.","MS. LOGAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","Lorie, just for clarification, chart 7, for example, that’s based on the assumption that you do purchases of Treasury bills through year-end, but not beyond then.","MR. LAUBACH"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","So if you look at the April hole, if you continue to do some purchases, that would shrink that April hole.","MR. LAUBACH"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","This is just following up, I think, on President Evans’s question one more time.","MR. BARKIN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","That estimate didn’t play out the way we expected it to.","MR. BARKIN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","Do we have any insight as to why?","MR. BARKIN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","Did the banks that we talked to misestimate or market movements?","MR. BARKIN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","Just—do we have any insight as to why?","MR. BARKIN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","That would help me on where we want to go.","MR. BARKIN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I can discuss that question in the context of the Senior Financial Officer Survey,","MS. ZOBEL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","which is how we’ve learned about reserve demand,","MS. ZOBEL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","and through conversations with market participants.","MS. ZOBEL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","The majority of the Senior Financial Officer Survey respondents noted that internal liquidity stress tests and high-payment flow days were the determinants of their lowest comfortable level of reserves (LCLoRs),","MS. ZOBEL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","and so each of those banks responded for their own estimates of what their stress payment outflows might be.","MS. ZOBEL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","Some banks consider this lowest comfortable level of reserves to be a hard floor.","MS. ZOBEL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","and they tend to hold cushions above that to make sure they don’t breach that level.","MS. ZOBEL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","It could be that on high payment flow days,","MS. ZOBEL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","banks increase the cushion that they want to hold above those LCLoRs,","MS. ZOBEL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","and we heard a little bit about that from banks that day.","MS. ZOBEL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","banks increase their demand for reserves on days that have high-payment flows.","MS. ZOBEL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","Also, on some high-payment flow days, banks end up with unexpected surpluses of reserves.","MS. ZOBEL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","And what we know from the survey is that banks are not willing to lend those reserves to other banks in the interbank market,","MS. ZOBEL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","and we think of that as distributional frictions.","MS. ZOBEL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I think we had a sense before that there were distributional frictions that we couldn’t measure,","MS. ZOBEL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","and we talked about that a few times.","MS. ZOBEL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I think what we found is that they are quite large,","MS. ZOBEL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","and the willingness of banks to give up these surplus reserves above the governance minimum is actually quite low,","MS. ZOBEL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","they may have been willing to relax those distributional frictions that may result in a higher level of reserves being needed.","MS. ZOBEL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","Just getting back to the Chair’s question, we’re using this “organic growth of the balance sheet” term pretty loosely.","MS. BRAINARD"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","Can you just—what are we talking about?","MS. BRAINARD"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","Is this trend growth in currency?","MS. BRAINARD"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","Are you really thinking about compensating for all shocks to nonreserve liabilities and keeping that kind of smooth?","MS. BRAINARD"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","It just seems important for this question about how much we’re going to be intervening.","MS. BRAINARD"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","So the way we were framing the discussion about “organic growth” is meant to be the average trend growth in all of the Federal Reserve’s liabilities—which would include some trend growth in reserves as well.","MS. LOGAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I used the number of $20 billion per month.","MS. LOGAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","that would depend importantly on the forecast of that trend growth,","MS. LOGAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","but something in that order of magnitude.","MS. LOGAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","depending on the level of buffer that the Committee decided to hold above this minimum level of reserves—that average pace might differ.","MS. LOGAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","if there was a lower level of buffer above this minimum level of reserves,","MS. LOGAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","then that $20 billion per month might be quite volatile over the course of the year to maintain reserves above that level.","MS. LOGAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","It would still average that over the course of the year,","MS. LOGAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","but some months those purchases may be larger,","MS. LOGAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","and other months those purchases may be smaller.","MS. LOGAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","If the Committee were to decide to maintain a larger buffer over the minimum,","MS. LOGAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","then those average purchases would be more consistent across months over the course of the year.","MS. LOGAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","Well, I did have one more question.","MR. EVANS"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I don’t mean to get ahead of anything,","MR. EVANS"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","but we did have the options for communications items laid out.","MR. EVANS"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","And one issue is timing there,","MR. EVANS"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","in terms of whether or not we wait until the October FOMC meeting or we do something sooner.","MR. EVANS"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","that you’re going to be speaking at the National Association of Business Economists (NABE) convention next week on Tuesday.","MR. EVANS"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","And I guess a question I kind of have is,","MR. EVANS"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","how do you anticipate touching on the money market issue?","MR. EVANS"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","Or would you be thinking about talking about it at all?","MR. EVANS"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","No, it does, to some extent, depend on what we decide today.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I am planning on getting that question, and I’ll have to have a good answer.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","If we come to a broad consensus on what to do and also agree that we might move to do that next week at a meeting,","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","then I think it would be a good time to maybe lean a little bit forward and foreshadow that.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","And I would expect Vice Chair Williams to do the same,","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","as the head of the New York Fed.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","then I’ll certainly play off what we agree to and discuss today.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","if we are going to make an intermeeting announcement,","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","it would be good to telegraph it a little bit,","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","just to sort of take some of the buzz off that so that it doesn’t seem completely out of the blue if the market already has a sense of what we’re doing.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","Again, I haven’t decided that yet.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","these things to smooth us through—and I’m not against it—are we taking away, in your estimation, any chance that the market can create some more financial resiliency by doing better about intermediating with each other?","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","Or are these just fixed, hard things that you have discovered that aren’t changing?","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","And I just don’t know where you are on that.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I think it’s important to look back over the course of the year as the level of reserves has been declining.","MS. LOGAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","We have seen banks with surplus reserves lending those into the repo market.","MS. LOGAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","So some of the changes that we’ve been seeing and the correlation between movements and repo and unsecured have been because banks have been lending more or less of some of that surplus into the repo market based on price movements.","MS. LOGAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","There is some distribution that’s taking place.","MS. LOGAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","That distribution tends to take place more in the repo market,","MS. LOGAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","and less in the interbank unsecured market than it did pre-crisis because of the regulatory frictions associated with the cost of balance sheet for those two types of transactions.","MS. LOGAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","and so I think if we were going to see an enhancement in that distributional process,","MS. LOGAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","some banks that don’t currently do that type of transaction would have to begin to do that,","MS. LOGAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","and that’s not part of their business model today.","MS. LOGAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","That’s particularly true for some of the large domestic banks outside the SIFIs and also with regional banks as well.","MS. LOGAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","And it’s unclear what type of price that would require for them to change that business activity and over what length of time.","MS. LOGAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","[No response] I don’t see any hands waving.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","Let’s begin our opportunity to comment, beginning with Vice Chair Williams.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","with Thomas there—efforts to analyze and distill a lot of information from supervision,","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","from our market outreach with our economists,","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","to really come to an understanding,","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","of the events in the past few weeks and to come up with policy interventions that I think have been very effective,","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","at least in the past few weeks,","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","at stabilizing conditions in money markets and,","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","keeping the federal funds rate well within the range.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","In thinking about the topic for today and for our next meetings,","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I do think it’s important to start from the decision that the FOMC made,","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","in January and then in following meetings,","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","about having an ample-reserves operational framework.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I think this is the right decision.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","This is the decision that, you know, we discussed at length.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","and assess at what point we think the level of reserves is at a level appropriate to carry out,","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","And the way I think about this—and this gets back to President Evans’s comment and questions and President Rosengren’s,","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","Is it an ample-reserves regime?","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","We are not doing regular or frequent open market operations.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","and that’s what success will look like in the medium term.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","In light of the events of the past few weeks,","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I think that it’s really important to—the points that both Patricia and Lorie made,","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","that we’ve actually been watching for many months an evolution in the behavior in these markets.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","We’ve seen the funds rate spread to the IOER rate rising gradually as the level of reserves has gone down.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","We’ve seen issues in terms of the spread of interest rates,","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","just a lot more sensitivity of the repo rates and the federal funds rates to shifts in the underlying payments and demand for reserves.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","So instead of lending into that market,","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","we saw a lot of pulling back from that and therefore,","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","amplifying some of the movements in repo rates and funding rates.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","as we’ve been doing regular open market operations and we did the term operations that were at quarter-end,","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","that that concern about “I know I have funding today,","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","but what about tomorrow and what about next week and what about quarter-end?” has damped down,","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","and we’ve seen that be successful.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","We’re looking at all of these indicators over the past six months or so and especially the evidence from the past few weeks.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","It’s clear that we are close to,","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","a level of reserves in the system that will support an ample-reserves framework.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","You know, we talked about, why early September?","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","How to think about that is that we were running around $1.45 trillion to $1.5 trillion in that period,","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","as we saw the reserves come down,","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","that’s when the stress really did become amplified.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","As we’ve brought in up to $150 billion to $200 billion into reserves,","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","we did bring the total quantity of reserves,","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","and markets seemed to be functioning.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","So that’s another data point that,","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","at least over the next several months,","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","this level seems to support well-functioning money markets.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","So in terms of how I’m approaching these issues,","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I’m thinking about the medium-term goal of getting to a sustained ample-reserves regime.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","If we were in a world in which everything was growing very smoothly,","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","that would just entail growth,","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","you look at the gray part of figure 7—without actions,","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","the amount of reserves in the system,","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","due to some seasonal and other factors,","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","will level of reserves—we will actually see reserves decline quite a bit.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","If you wonder what picture keeps me up at night,","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","it is this picture—it’s about the need to take action relatively soon,","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","in order to keep reserves ample on a sustained basis.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","Again, I think about this longer-term or medium-term strategy.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","It does consist of both a transition to get through the year-end and a longer-term sustained level of reserves,","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","and the way we talked about it such that the amount of total reserves in the system doesn’t dip below this current level very often.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","whether it’s a standing facility or however we operate,","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","thinking about next April or May and on—those are only there as a backstop for quarter-ends or other days when big payment shocks cause there to be some stress in the market.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","going back to President Rosengren’s comment,","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","a successful ample- reserves system is one in which we are not doing frequent open market operations actively,","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","and perhaps with some kind of backstop there just to provide that support.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I think an important point is what we’ve learned—and Lorie made this point very clearly—is that bank reserves are not perfect substitutes with open market operations.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","do not pass through directly through the financial system fully and,","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","as we think about the long-run or medium-term strategy.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I do think that we do need to get through the end of the year with interest rate control.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","That is an important part for the FOMC and for monetary policy.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","as we transition through the next several months,","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","a combination of purchases and a building-up of the bank reserves over a period of many months so that we have To get us through that period,","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","given this decline in reserves,","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I think a combination of overnight and term repos will be there to supply reserves into the system to support the FOMC’s directive for the federal funds rate to be in the target range.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I do think we need to have both of these pieces,","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","because the long run requires us to get bank reserves higher,","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","but to get through the next few months,","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","we’re going to need repos to support that.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I think there is a matter of needing to move quickly because we need to get the level of bank reserves higher,","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","in order to have confidence that we have good control of the federal funds rate.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","In terms of delay, it just means that you have to do more per month.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I think it’s really important that this is not about the stance of monetary policy.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","This is really about the execution of monetary policy.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","We’ve already described our ample-reserves regime.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","We’re told everybody that we would be monitoring and analyzing and coming into a view,","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","that we’re maintaining those level reserves.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","And so it’s really about executing on a plan that’s out there.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I do think we have to avoid any perception that this is a restart of quantitative easing or of “asset purchases for monetary policy,” from the point of view of monetary policy stance.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","So there are some pretty strong advantages associated with gradually,","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","building the level of reserves up in such a way that we maintain the level of reserves.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I think buying Treasury bills—T-bills,","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","or potentially shorter-term Treasury securities,","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","or both—can make that point clearly.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","think is important is that we’re really trying to lay out this medium-term strategy.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","We are laying out a strategy about how to get through April,","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","kind of the context of all of this.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","Then there’s the issue that we have to do about how do they’re already kind of thinking that that’s what we need to do,","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I do think there are some advantages in providing greater clarity that that’s what our approach is over the next six,","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I think that what we’ve learned also is that with year-end coming,","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","having that clarity and understanding in the marketplace earlier reduces some of this worry and stress around what’s going to happen at year-end and some of that behavior.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I also think it’s important that we have this flexibility in our approach.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","One of the things that’s come up a lot is,","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","we don’t have all the answers about why things happened.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","There’s ambiguity about the appropriate level of reserves.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","There’s going to be continued learning, continuing analysis as we move forward.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","success right now is laying out an overarching strategy of how we plan to get through April,","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","how we get from here to there,","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","but also having that flexibility that as things evolve,","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","how are we going to adjust our decisions and plans about that.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","from the point of view of market communications,","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","markets are not focused on us making a decision anytime soon.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","They are thinking we’re waiting until October.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","But I will assure you that between now and the October meeting,","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","the amount of chatter and comments and articles and people talking about “What’s the Fed going to do—they need to have a plan,","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","they don’t have a plan”—it’s just going to rise and rise.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","So even though they may be saying they’re not expecting anything until October,","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I think there’s just going to be a lot of uncertainty and debate out there.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","And if we’re silent on this and we’re not expressing our own strategy and plans ahead of that,","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I think that that could also be somewhat disruptive.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","would have expected from relatively routine shocks,","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","and I have been surprised by the reputational effects,","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","which are also much greater than I thought,","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","as Vice Chair Williams just highlighted,","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","the repo market is now the subject of regular news articles.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","It’s not good if I know my plumber’s phone number without looking it up on a phone.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","[Laughter] And it’s probably not good if financial plumbing becomes the questions of nonfinancial reporters.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","And so my own experience has been that,","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","at every talk and in every briefing with a reporter,","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","these questions are coming up.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","There is much broader interest in something that we probably ideally should be doing in the background.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","The second concern I have on the reputational effects is,","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","there are a lot of misleading articles,","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","frequently by people who don’t quite understand what’s happening in the money markets.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","But they’re making associations to the financial crisis or to other kinds of disruptive economic concerns,","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","and I think that’s really problematic at a time when there’s a fair amount of uncertainty about the outlook.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","So those reputational concerns are something that I think we ought to think about,","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","in terms of both the urgency and speed with which we address what’s been happening in the money markets.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","My own preference would be to have an abundant-reserves regime rather than an ample- reserves regime.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I know I have lost this debate,","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","but I think we’ve learned the costs are actually larger than I might have thought,","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","and I think this is the appropriate time to think that maybe there’s little cause for taking out more insurance against the volatility we’ve recently seen.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","And given that these reputational risks seem a little bit greater,","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I’d prefer not to be so close to the upward-sloping part of the demand for reserves.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","options, that would be my preferred option.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","However, my preference would be to be bolder.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","As the memo highlighted, there are going to be more downdrafts and reserves next year.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I’d prefer to announce a technical adjustment relatively soon—involving a larger expansion of our balance sheet,","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","possibly including notes and bonds,","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","in light of some of the Q&A that just occurred,","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","in addition to more quickly increasing the bill purchases.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","This would more quickly get away from the need for term repurchase agreements and have us better situated for lower reserve balances next year.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","Maybe it was better when I was on mute.","MR. HARKER"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","[Laughter] Although I share the immediate concerns for our money markets,","MR. HARKER"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I would like to briefly start by posing two fundamental questions that go beyond the recent developments.","MR. HARKER"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I think we need to ask ourselves if the existing regulations or supervision explicitly or implicitly favor reserves over other high-quality liquid assets and are interfering with market functioning.","MR. HARKER"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","The second question is whether the federal funds rate remains the best choice for our policy target,","MR. HARKER"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","given that the unsecured lending market is decidedly thin compared to the repo market.","MR. HARKER"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","these questions are not on the agenda today,","MR. HARKER"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","but I believe we should revisit them and other fundamental issues in the near future.","MR. HARKER"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","Regarding the pressing operational matters,","MR. HARKER"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I believe we should take action as soon as possible to keep the level of reserves somewhat north of $1.4 trillion through the end of the year.","MR. HARKER"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I suspect that a lower level of reserves could still be compatible with an ample-reserves regime.","MR. HARKER"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","there is little to gain by letting reserves decline further at this point and much more to lose if we struggle with interest rate control.","MR. HARKER"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","With regard to the questions of how to stabilize reserves,","MR. HARKER"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I have a preference toward outright purchases of Treasury bills in the faster- purchases scenario,","MR. HARKER"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","effectively restarting the organic growth of the balance sheet.","MR. HARKER"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","the right mix should also include term repo operations as well as overnight repo operations as a backstop for rate control.","MR. HARKER"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","So, like many things in life, “Timing is everything,” as they say.","MR. HARKER"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","Let me turn to the question of whether to announce our actions before the October FOMC meeting.","MR. HARKER"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I actually see both pros and cons to this.","MR. HARKER"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","In light of the large shortfall of reserves projected by year-end in the absence of actions,","MR. HARKER"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","an early start to purchases would be helpful and allow a smoother and slower pace.","MR. HARKER"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","Yet moving early may surprise markets—which could,","MR. HARKER"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","lead market participants to believe that there are broader concerns about financial stability or liquidity.","MR. HARKER"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","the tiebreaker is the ever-present risk that our actions may be misperceived as a change in our policy stance.","MR. HARKER"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","The silver lining—if there is a silver lining in the September episode—is that this has actually made our communications,","MR. HARKER"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","giving us a real-life illustration of the kind of episode that we aim to avoid by restarting the organic growth of the balance sheet.","MR. HARKER"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","That said, we cannot be too cautious.","MR. HARKER"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","A decision today and an announcement shortly thereafter would put further distance between implementation decisions and the stance of monetary policy,","MR. HARKER"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","particularly because we cannot discount the possibility of a rate cut in October.","MR. HARKER"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","Thus, I favor taking immediate action.","MR. HARKER"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","So I’d like to save our occasional disagreements for monetary policy but strive in this case to try to send a unified message.","MR. HARKER"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","So I’ll join what I’m sure will be a tsunami of thanks to the staff for the quick and clear analysis of recent repo market developments.","MR. QUARLES"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I know how much work that has been and,","MR. QUARLES"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","the time constraints that it has been done under.","MR. QUARLES"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","So much more is clear than was clear two weeks ago,","MR. QUARLES"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","although there is still a bunch that remains unclear.","MR. QUARLES"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","But my current view is that the recent spike in rates is primarily indicative,","MR. QUARLES"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","as President Harker was suggesting,","MR. QUARLES"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","of structural features in our regulatory framework that have introduced rigidities into the system’s ability to allocate reserves across institutions.","MR. QUARLES"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","In the absence of those regulatory and supervisory incentives and disincentives,","MR. QUARLES"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","which we have introduced into the system,","MR. QUARLES"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","my current hypothesis on the basis of what we’re hearing is that the current overall level of reserves would be abundant—should be more than abundant,","MR. QUARLES"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","or whatever the correct word is—and I view the problem as one of allocation rather than scarcity.","MR. QUARLES"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","Now, directing those incentives would be a midterm project, and we have a short-term problem.","MR. QUARLES"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","And today’s discussion is to focus on handling the short-term issue.","MR. QUARLES"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I don’t want to distract us from that.","MR. QUARLES"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","the regulatory and supervisory issues that I think are in question are matters for the Board rather than the Committee.","MR. QUARLES"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","That’s why I mention that point whenever raising regulatory issues in an FOMC meeting.","MR. QUARLES"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","But I do think that my particular contribution to this discussion is at least to lay out how I see those issues having contributed to So what’s the source of the allocation problem?","MR. QUARLES"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","Banks have told us—and the largest banks have particularly emphasized this—that they feel under supervisory pressure for reserves over short-term Treasury securities in satisfying their liquidity requirements in a post-crisis framework.","MR. QUARLES"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","they cited other regulatory incentives as well that are related to the leverage ratio and the calculation of the G-SIB surcharge.","MR. QUARLES"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I think these latter two are much less likely to have been particularly relevant to the events of September,","MR. QUARLES"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","but I do think that the unwillingness of the large banks to part with reserves at any price in September is showing us that we need to address those incentives that are biasing some banks to hold reserves over Treasury securities.","MR. QUARLES"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","the consequences of the current liquidity measures come from two principal elements:","MR. QUARLES"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","the Liquidity Coverage Ratio and the internal liquidity stress tests that we require banks to run.","MR. QUARLES"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","The Liquidity Coverage Ratio— again,","MR. QUARLES"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","as almost all of you know but maybe not all of you have at the top of your head— establishes a minimum that firms have to comply with.","MR. QUARLES"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","It’s based on standardized definitions and outflow rates.","MR. QUARLES"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","And under the Liquidity Coverage Ratio,","MR. QUARLES"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","the actual regulation—there’s no difference between reserves and Treasury securities.","MR. QUARLES"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","The stress tests are not, necessarily.","MR. QUARLES"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","our supervisors conducted an internal liquidity stress-test buffer monetization exam,","MR. QUARLES"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","looking at how the firms were assigning appropriate monetization haircuts to highly liquid securities in the event of stress.","MR. QUARLES"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","And there are differences in the speed and ease of monetization of Treasury securities and reserves,","MR. QUARLES"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","and that will show up in the banks’ internal liquidity stress test.","MR. QUARLES"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","fair bit of time since mid-September on the phone with my counterparts at the Bank of England and ECB,","MR. QUARLES"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","who were quite direct about that.","MR. QUARLES"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","has a much lower level of long-term demand for reserves,","MR. QUARLES"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","as I’ve mentioned in the Committee before—close to $400 billion relative to what,","MR. QUARLES"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","$2 trillion and now $1.45 trillion or higher.","MR. QUARLES"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","a standing repo facility would be important in conjunction with this,","MR. QUARLES"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","and I’m looking forward to our discussion at the October meeting.","MR. QUARLES"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","Part of the concern with these internal liquidity stress tests is that there is a difference between the monetizability of reserves and Treasury securities and stress—it’s not huge,","MR. QUARLES"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","And a standing repo facility—or at least the Platonic ideal of such a facility—would dramatically reduce or eliminate such a difference and,","MR. QUARLES"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","reduce or eliminate the different treatment of reserves and Treasury securities in banks’ liquidity stress tests.","MR. QUARLES"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","has a facility through which the central bank monetizes nonreserve high-quality liquid assets,","MR. QUARLES"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","and this is likely to be a factor in their much lower long-term level of reserves demand—although negative interest rates are also a strong contributor,","MR. QUARLES"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","So such a facility would be helpful in handling periods of stress,","MR. QUARLES"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","but it would also likely lower the overall demand for reserves by guaranteeing the convertibility of Treasury securities.","MR. QUARLES"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","banks that this would likely be the case and,","U.S"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","would have made the events in September much less likely had it all been in place by then.","U.S"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","But we do not yet have really the rough quantification of the size of this effect,","U.S"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","and the details around such a facility would be complex.","U.S"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","Much remains to be worked out.","U.S"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","So recognizing that we either use effect on the demand for reserves would be even if we do implement these measures,","U.S"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","and we have to have a plan to cover the near term.","U.S"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","in addition to the current levels of reserves,","U.S"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","whether and to what extent these structural rigidities can be addressed.","U.S"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","So I now turn to the topic for today—the potential plans for expanding the balance sheet detailed in the staff memo.","U.S"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","Principally because I view this as an allocation rather than a level problem,","U.S"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","if we were to grow the balance sheet,","U.S"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I’d like to do that in a way most likely not to confuse our actions with a renewal of QE.","U.S"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","There are fraught communications issues in resuming balance sheet growth at this point and seemingly under duress.","U.S"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I prefer buying bills in order to have the least effect on the market for duration.","U.S"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","My preference would be for smaller interventions.","U.S"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I’d like to keep the amount as close to the organic growth of currency demand as possible,","U.S"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","but I do recognize that “as close as possible” may,","U.S"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","be quite a significant addition to reserves in the near term,","U.S"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","in order to address this short-term issue.","U.S"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","As we think about how all of this will evolve over the longer term,","U.S"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I think we should keep in mind the potential effects of our ability to address these incentives.","U.S"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I’m sorry—I thought I was in the order last.","MS. DALY"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I’m supportive of announcing in advance of our next scheduled meeting,","MS. DALY"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","that we intend to rebuild and maintain reserves at or moderately above levels prevailing earlier this year.","MS. DALY"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","This would provide assurance to market participants—and to the public more generally,","MS. DALY"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","to the Like Vice Chair Williams,","MS. DALY"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I would like to remain flexible and focus on our goals of interest rate control and providing ample reserves in order to execute on that.","MS. DALY"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I worry if we provide too much detail—although Thomas and Lorie convinced me of September having some benefits,","MS. DALY"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","could signal too much confidence in the quantity when we’re actually not sure about that.","MS. DALY"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","We have a lot of uncertainty, and we’re going to continue to learn.","MS. DALY"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","What we’re really sure about is that we want the funds rate to trade within the range,","MS. DALY"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","and the rest of it is something we’re going to learn about.","MS. DALY"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","So I lean toward fewer details—as few as would reasonable—and more framework and commitment.","MS. DALY"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","in terms of the two options presented in the staff memo,","MS. DALY"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I’m in favor of using purchases of Treasury bills as the primary tool for ensuring an ample supply of reserves.","MS. DALY"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I tend to favor the approach of a faster pace of bill purchases.","MS. DALY"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I would like to even consider an alternative strategy that front-loads these purchases,","MS. DALY"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","taking the opportunity of making a technical adjustment because there’s so much emphasis right now on the disruptions in the repo market and perhaps make some immediate larger purchases to the extent that the market can withstand it in order to get us back up to a level that’s more comfortable.","MS. DALY"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","We could then allow the balance sheet to grow more organically as we learn about the desired level of reserves and whether to use a standing repo facility.","MS. DALY"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","And here I support the idea that has been discussed by many that the standing repo facility,","MS. DALY"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","should be something we occasionally use.","MS. DALY"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","My understanding of an ample-reserves regime is we rarely need to go to that—only for payment shocks.","MS. DALY"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","this seems like a sizable decision—and one that we should take ownership of.","MS. DALY"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","Importantly, I think we can take control of the narrative.","MS. DALY"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","Right now, the narrative is being written for us.","MS. DALY"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","And it’s often not very positive, as President Rosengren mentioned.","MS. DALY"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","The opportunity for us to go in and say,","MS. DALY"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","this is a technical adjustment.","MS. DALY"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","We’re committed to having the funds rate trade within the range we’ve stated”—I think those are things that,","MS. DALY"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","if we have unified talking points,","MS. DALY"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I’ve actually been in situations like many of you—more than I’d like to be,","MS. DALY"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","really—of being asked these questions by my board of directors,","MS. DALY"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","many of whom are involved in markets.","MS. DALY"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","And when you go through the details and explain the framework and explain what we’re doing,","MS. DALY"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","And I think this is enhanced by being at the short end,","MS. DALY"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","using bills and not longer-duration purchases.","MS. DALY"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","That really kind of tells them that this is not QE, it’s really technical adjustments.","MS. DALY"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","So I believe that we can do this.","MS. DALY"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I would like to see us do it earlier,","MS. DALY"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","so that we don’t confuse distinct things.","MS. DALY"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","It’s just another opportunity not to confuse the stance of monetary policy with the plumbing or the execution of policy.","MS. DALY"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","So with that I would say, thank you, Mr.","MS. DALY"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I want to thank New York and the Board for all the hard work.","MR. EVANS"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","This is an area in which helping educate us all on the details of money markets and how they behave and new development here is really important.","MR. EVANS"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","channel of our monetary policy transmission mechanism is directly through credit intermediation that supports our growth and inflation mandates.","MR. EVANS"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","The Committee’s recent actions to cut rates have worked to recalibrate our policy setting to a more accommodative setting of the federal funds rate.","MR. EVANS"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","Unexpected financial volatility in money markets that’s symptomatic of weaker,","MR. EVANS"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","poor market functioning increases the cost of credit intermediation.","MR. EVANS"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","Unintended additional volatility may frustrate our recent policy actions.","MR. EVANS"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","So making adjustments to our programs here—that’s not monetary policy,","MR. EVANS"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","but it is important for monetary policy.","MR. EVANS"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","This is likely to be a challenging issue,","MR. EVANS"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","as our preference for pointing to the setting of administered rates,","MR. EVANS"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","like the IOER rate and the ON RRP rate,","MR. EVANS"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","will likely be less powerful alone.","MR. EVANS"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","as the IOER rate is reduced further within the funds rate target range,","MR. EVANS"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","the market’s determination of the federal funds rate is becoming less about arbitraging administered spreads to the IOER and ON RRP rates,","MR. EVANS"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","and it’s more about arbitraging spreads to money market rates,","MR. EVANS"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","which we don’t control directly.","MR. EVANS"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","And I think the size of reserves in the system probably influences which arbitrage is going to be most prevalent.","MR. EVANS"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","So that’s why that’s going to be important for us.","MR. EVANS"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","This tells me that our earlier,","MR. EVANS"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","better experience when we had a clearly ample quantity of reserves was important.","MR. EVANS"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","We haven’t defined “ample” precisely—but the recent market disruptions are clear evidence that reserves have fallen below “ample.” So the question now is,","MR. EVANS"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","what’s the best way to get back to an appropriate level?","MR. EVANS"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","And I think Governor Brainard’s question about—we’re talking about organic growth a lot.","MR. EVANS"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","What do we really mean by that?","MR. EVANS"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I agree with Lorie’s response that there are trend factors that we’re other nonreserve liabilities are evolving.","MR. EVANS"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","So there’s going to be a lot going on,","MR. EVANS"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","and we shouldn’t be surprised if we have to revisit moments like this.","MR. EVANS"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I doubt that organic growth is going to be the easy type of in-the-background assessment that we would all like.","MR. EVANS"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","we obviously need to implement a near-term fix in order to keep money markets best aligned with our policy setting.","MR. EVANS"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","But we also need a longer-term plan for how we will maintain an ample-reserves regime over time.","MR. EVANS"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","It seems clear to me that such a plan will include Treasury security purchases.","MR. EVANS"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","we will need to grow our balance sheet to keep up with organic growth in currency and other nonreserve liabilities.","MR. EVANS"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","We will do this by buying Treasury securities, just as we always have.","MR. EVANS"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","So we should coalesce around a long-term implementation plan that includes regular asset purchases.","MR. EVANS"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","It makes sense to rely on Treasury bill purchases now as much as possible to address the immediate problem of our current reserves shortfall.","MR. EVANS"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","As I understand our risks and policy objectives,","MR. EVANS"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I favor emphasizing bill purchases to add the majority,","MR. EVANS"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","of the new reserves and using a combination of daily and term repos to fill in the market-functioning details.","MR. EVANS"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","So I think that the $60 billion per month T-bills proposal is better than the $30 billion per month proposal.","MR. EVANS"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I agree with the Daly–Rosengren proposal so far,","MR. EVANS"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","about making a one-time program of additional purchases of some size to close the gap sooner would be helpful.","MR. EVANS"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I recognize that some have worried that outright bill purchases may be misconstrued as a new round of quantitative easing.","MR. EVANS"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I think that’s a communications issue that can be dealt with quite adequately by the Chair and supporting commentary coming from all of us and also publication of the implementation details.","MR. EVANS"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","Basically, with quantitative easing, hands of the private sector.","MR. EVANS"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","It’s really all about duration,","MR. EVANS"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","for anybody who’s paying attention to what the actual thrust is of QE purchases we’re supposed to be doing.","MR. EVANS"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","Short-term bill purchases will not add to duration meaningfully,","MR. EVANS"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","and this just really becomes a communications task.","MR. EVANS"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","there’s undoubtedly much to learn about financial stability from the past few weeks,","MR. EVANS"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","and we’ve already heard commentary by President Harker and Governor Quarles about the implications of regulatory policy—supervisory interpretation of things that are interesting and we should digest better.","MR. EVANS"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","One lesson that’s been driven home for me is the value of ample reserves and facilitating the intermediation process and in preventing an amplification of market volatility.","MR. EVANS"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","The ample-reserves regime has proven its ability to prevent small shocks from turning into big problems.","MR. EVANS"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","One conclusion I drew from the memo is that there’s a good chance that the early September tax payments and Treasury security issuance would not have even shown up on our radar screens if reserves had been higher—say,","MR. EVANS"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","at the level of just a few months ago.","MR. EVANS"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","an implementation regime that can handle these kinds of shocks seems to be exactly what the Federal Reserve Act had in mind when it told us to furnish an elastic currency.","MR. EVANS"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I’m uncomfortable with communicating a message that our balance sheet goal is merely reserves at the level of early September.","MR. EVANS"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","We need to make sure that we’ve got a large margin for error,","MR. EVANS"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","and that’s why I asked about other assessments of what those numbers might be.","MR. EVANS"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","Some of those numbers were larger, and some were smaller.","MR. EVANS"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","So we need a larger margin for error.","MR. EVANS"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I don’t know what that number should be.","MR. EVANS"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I’d err on the side of making sure we had plenty.","MR. EVANS"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","The It’s certainly the case that regulatory adjustments for some of the largest banks that are worried about the Liquidity Coverage Ratio and the supervisory implications could be an important aspect to that.","MR. EVANS"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","But I go back to what we were thinking about when we said,","MR. EVANS"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","“We want an ample balance sheet,","MR. EVANS"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","and we’re focused on efficiency.” Efficiency always sounds like an excellent idea.","MR. EVANS"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","and I’m an economist, so I certainly subscribe to—we like efficient outcomes.","MR. EVANS"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","it always struck me that efficiency was more about “optics” and people criticizing the Federal Reserve for having a profligate size of the balance sheet.","MR. EVANS"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","We’ve already sort of incurred some costs for wanting a somewhat lower-sized balance sheet,","MR. EVANS"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","and if we go the route of just adjusting regulatory policy somewhat,","MR. EVANS"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","hoping that that will help us,","MR. EVANS"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I think that that’s got quite a lot of risk.","MR. EVANS"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I would describe that as a risky strategy, myself.","MR. EVANS"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","Lastly, I agree with the suggestions that we should communicate earlier.","MR. EVANS"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I asked about the NABE speech.","MR. EVANS"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I would be completely comfortable with the Chair taking the lead early on describing all of the issues that are in front of us and providing some indication of what the Committee action is likely to be.","MR. EVANS"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","Bolder is safer, I think, for our monetary policy and the objectives that we have.","MR. EVANS"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","It is customary to thank the staff, but thanks are especially warranted this time.","MR. CLARIDA"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","special thanks to Vice Chair Williams,","MR. CLARIDA"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","who has led the effort and brought us to a good set of notes and materials for discussing this.","MR. CLARIDA"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I’m broadly supportive of the outlines of the effort that have been outlined in the memos that would combine a resumption of bill purchases with the operations as well.","MR. CLARIDA"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","that the artful approach here is useful to us—to put in the language with reference to the September level of reserves but also indicating that we would probably want a cushion above that,","MR. CLARIDA"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","but to leave that with a degree of ambiguity to give us the ability to be flexible there.","MR. CLARIDA"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","The reason why I like that approach to communications is that we announced in July that we were bringing the process of balance sheet reduction to an end,","MR. CLARIDA"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","and we also indicated that we would be learning about the appropriate point and that we would resume purchases.","MR. CLARIDA"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","And putting this in September and achieving that level,","MR. CLARIDA"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","provides us with a bridge between the July decision and what will be the October decision.","MR. CLARIDA"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I agree with Presidents Daly and Evans and others and, I think, President Harker.","MR. CLARIDA"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I would certainly strongly urge that we do this before the October meeting.","MR. CLARIDA"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I think that would serve a couple of purposes.","MR. CLARIDA"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","It would serve the purpose of distinguishing between an ambitious but ultimately a technical action in the functioning of the markets from a policy decision.","MR. CLARIDA"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","Literally, there would be time between those two announcements.","MR. CLARIDA"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","Also, we’ll have important issues to discuss in October.","MR. CLARIDA"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","It would give us more time to do that.","MR. CLARIDA"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","So I am very enthusiastic about doing that before the next meeting.","MR. CLARIDA"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","In terms of preference for the details,","MR. CLARIDA"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I would have a preference for something similar to option 8 on exhibit 2,","MR. CLARIDA"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","but with the addition— that I think both Presidents Rosengren and Daly mentioned—that,","MR. CLARIDA"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","instead of having a constant amount of purchases over the window,","MR. CLARIDA"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","would think of some months where there would be some bunching of purchases at very high levels.","MR. CLARIDA"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","My preference would be to put that in December, through outright purchases.","MR. CLARIDA"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I think we’d need to keep the term repos in place,","MR. CLARIDA"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","doing $60 billion a month continuously,","MR. CLARIDA"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","do a somewhat smaller—perhaps much smaller—number in most months and then really loading in big purchases if that were technically possible.","MR. CLARIDA"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","Let me conclude with a couple of longer-term thoughts.","MR. CLARIDA"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I know our interest is the near term,","MR. CLARIDA"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","but I do think I’d like to provide some context on some points that Governor Quarles mentioned.","MR. CLARIDA"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I do think we’re going to end up,","MR. CLARIDA"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","with a standing repo facility.","MR. CLARIDA"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I think that can be potentially helpful in a lot of dimensions that we’ve discussed.","MR. CLARIDA"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I know that’s not on the table today,","MR. CLARIDA"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","but certainly my own view is that it’s going to have to be an element of a longer- term solution.","MR. CLARIDA"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","One thing that I did pick up in my conversations that we had with the Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee (TBAC) crowd when they were at the Board last week is that it will be important to get the details and the way we communicate a standing repo facility,","MR. CLARIDA"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","If we really want this to be a facility that we use as a substitute for having high reserve levels,","MR. CLARIDA"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","then they need to know that they are able to use it in size.","MR. CLARIDA"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","We’d have to think about the pricing,","MR. CLARIDA"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","we’d have to think about the spread and all of that.","MR. CLARIDA"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I think that’s where we’re going to end up,","MR. CLARIDA"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","and I think that’s an important part of the longer-term resolution here.","MR. CLARIDA"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","Let me perhaps offer a cautionary note on the issue of the funds rate versus the repo market.","MR. CLARIDA"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","the repo market is much more important than the funds market now,","MR. CLARIDA"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","and the funds market is a different funds market than it was before the crisis.","MR. CLARIDA"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I would urge that we give a longer-term and really serious discussion over time to moving primary reason is that the repo market is much larger.","MR. CLARIDA"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I had my staff print a chart of the daily spread between general collateral (GC) repo,","MR. CLARIDA"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","and the funds rate going back 45 years.","MR. CLARIDA"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","That spread moves around all the time.","MR. CLARIDA"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","You can have a well-functioning,","MR. CLARIDA"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","healthy economy in the ’90s with the repo and the funds rate spread moving around.","MR. CLARIDA"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","And there are some reasons why that spread moves around.","MR. CLARIDA"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","The art to doing this is we don’t want a replay.","MR. CLARIDA"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","The move in this spread on September 17 was the largest spread in the history of the data set going back 45 years times 250 days a year.","MR. CLARIDA"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","So, yes, you don’t want those moves.","MR. CLARIDA"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I would be nervous about publicly committing us to the repo rate being plus or minus 1 basis point.","MR. CLARIDA"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","So we would have to be careful if we moved down that road.","MR. CLARIDA"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I’m not saying we are moving down that road, but that would be a consideration.","MR. CLARIDA"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","the staff has offered some good ideas about bridging between now and April on what we call the temporary open market operations.","MR. CLARIDA"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","At least one thing I’d put on the table is perhaps keying the decision to do those operations to where the funds rate itself trades.","MR. CLARIDA"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","on a day when the funds rate is within 1 or 2 or whatever basis points of the top of the range,","MR. CLARIDA"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","we might announce an operation.","MR. CLARIDA"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","And then that would make it clear that,","MR. CLARIDA"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","this is about controlling the funds rate.","MR. CLARIDA"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","This is about keeping the funds rate in the range.","MR. CLARIDA"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","there may be problems with that,","MR. CLARIDA"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","but it’s at least something to think about down the road when we’re talking about the detailed design of the temporary operations.","MR. CLARIDA"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","But, again, I do think this is going to be a necessary step.","MR. CLARIDA"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I like the idea of bridging between the July decision and what we would be announcing,","MR. CLARIDA"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","and I very much like the idea of doing it before our October 30 meeting.","MR. CLARIDA"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","President Kaplan, are you there?","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","[No response] We’ll go to President Bullard.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","And if President Kaplan comes back, we’ll have him.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","Like others, I agree with the notion of bolstering reserve balances.","MR. BARKIN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","we said we would gradually shrink the balance sheet and learn where the point of scarcity might be.","MR. BARKIN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","We’re not bothered by the fact that it was somewhat earlier than we might have thought.","MR. BARKIN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","“Excess reserves” in practice were just less than we had analyzed,","MR. BARKIN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I do worry that a message of $60 billion a month will be misinterpreted as a return to QE,","MR. BARKIN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","as it does appear comparably scaled.","MR. BARKIN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","Our communication needs to emphasize that this is about liabilities, not about assets.","MR. BARKIN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","It’s a reserves-maintenance program, not a balance sheet expansion.","MR. BARKIN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","In line with the options presented in the communication,","MR. BARKIN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I would just communicate the point that we will maintain reserves at a minimum level,","MR. BARKIN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","perhaps consistent with early September,","MR. BARKIN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","and to do that we will conduct a limited-time technical adjustment as necessary.","MR. BARKIN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I also worry that we, and the media, overfocus on volatility.","MR. BARKIN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","we had 30 days on which the effective federal funds rate was plus or minus 25 basis points away from target.","MR. BARKIN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","So I believe expecting zero volatility is not a sensible platform.","MR. BARKIN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I’m very supportive of a strategy that lowers the cost of volatility when it inevitably happens,","MR. BARKIN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","and the right repo facility has the potential to do that.","MR. BARKIN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","swings from the Treasury’s General Account.","MR. BARKIN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","Is there not some way to insulate reserves from these fluctuations?","MR. BARKIN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I’d love to explore any such options.","MR. BARKIN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I’m generally supportive of Desk recommendations on these issues to carry us through the current quarter and over year-end into the first quarter of 2020.","MR. BULLARD"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","But I do think that this has an ad hoc feel to it.","MR. BULLARD"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I think it requires careful management,","MR. BULLARD"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","especially around the quantitative easing issues as just articulated by President Barkin.","MR. BULLARD"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I think a standing repo facility would greatly mitigate many of the key issues that we face.","MR. BULLARD"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","There does appear to be a preference in markets for reserves to meet regulatory requirements concerning liquidity,","MR. BULLARD"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","such as the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR),","MR. BULLARD"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","and I agree with President Harker and Governor Quarles on this issue.","MR. BULLARD"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","Governor Clarida also brought this up.","MR. BULLARD"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I think this is a very important source of distributional issues within this market,","MR. BULLARD"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","and one that could be mitigated greatly by a standing repo facility.","MR. BULLARD"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","Another issue that we face is that we don’t want the federal funds rate trading above the upper end of the range,","MR. BULLARD"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","A standing repo facility would fix this.","MR. BULLARD"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","And also, we would meet an international standard.","MR. BULLARD"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","Other central banks operate with a repo facility and a reverse repo facility.","MR. BULLARD"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","So I think we could definitely go in this direction over the medium term,","MR. BULLARD"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","and I know we’ll have an opportunity to discuss this more at our upcoming meeting.","MR. BULLARD"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","One thing about a facility is that reserves could potentially be lower because of expectations effects—that is,","MR. BULLARD"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","knowing that the facility is there,","MR. BULLARD"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","because it would give the Committee more policy space should we eventually want to return to true quantitative easing at some point in the future in reaction to a particularly negative shock to the","MR. BULLARD"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I think that the measures being contemplated today should be characterized as temporary in nature,","U.S"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","pending a more permanent solution.","U.S"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I think that might be the right language here.","U.S"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I would also concur with others that we should announce before the October FOMC meeting in order to separate this decision from the policy decisions that could be made at the October meeting.","U.S"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I think it might muddle our message in October,","U.S"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","no matter what way the Committee goes,","U.S"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","if we try to announce this at the same time.","U.S"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","we have a better chance of keeping this as a technical adjustment sort of feel to it,","U.S"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","and we have a better chance of addressing the idea that this is not a return to quantitative easing in the United States despite the return to quantitative easing in Europe.","U.S"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","Chair Powell, I’m back on, in case you were looking for me.","MR. KAPLAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","President Kaplan, why don’t you go ahead then?","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","So I agree with the objectives as stated of returning to a sustainable level of ample reserves,","MR. KAPLAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","and I think the other objective I would have in assessing these options is erring on the side of preempting volatility in the future versus reacting to it.","MR. KAPLAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I prefer the faster approach as outlined,","MR. KAPLAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","the of short coupon securities,","MR. KAPLAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","if that’s our judgment of what the market could tolerate,","MR. KAPLAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I would also be supportive of that.","MR. KAPLAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","In terms of the public’s perception,","MR. KAPLAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I don’t personally think that if we’re buying bills and only short coupon securities,","MR. KAPLAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I don’t know that the public is going to be able to see much difference between $30 billion and $60 billion a month or even $60 billion and $80 billion a month,","MR. KAPLAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","and so I would rather back a solution that is more likely to address this issue and preempt future volatility.","MR. KAPLAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","So I would want to give the staff latitude to do that.","MR. KAPLAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","the communication is going to have to emphasize that this is not QE,","MR. KAPLAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","that it’s a technical adjustment,","MR. KAPLAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","but I actually believe we’ll be able to do that.","MR. KAPLAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","And I like bill purchases and relying more heavily on those,","MR. KAPLAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","for all the reasons others have said because it’s much more likely to spread reserves through the system.","MR. KAPLAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I would strongly favor doing an announcement well before the FOMC meeting,","MR. KAPLAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I think that would de-link it from monetary policy.","MR. KAPLAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","It’s more consistent with it being a technical adjustment,","MR. KAPLAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","and it allows us also to start making purchases sooner.","MR. KAPLAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I’m glad that Governor Quarles is talking about looking at the regulatory incentives for owning reserves versus Treasury securities,","MR. KAPLAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","that would be a good exercise to do.","MR. KAPLAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","It obviously doesn’t address this situation now.","MR. KAPLAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I think we would be very well served to get this issue off the table.","MR. KAPLAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I notice in my own meetings with the public that they are starting to raise broader concerns about liquidity at a time when the economic outlook is more uncertain and we’re more actions,","MR. KAPLAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","that err on the side of preempting future volatility and,","MR. KAPLAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","overdoing this a bit rather than underdoing it.","MR. KAPLAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","because I agree with the general consensus—that is,","MS. GEORGE"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","we should begin right away with our purchases of Treasury bills.","MS. GEORGE"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I think that’s the best short-term solution to getting our level of reserves back up.","MS. GEORGE"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","we should clarify what’s happening with some of these structural issues.","MS. GEORGE"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I think the fact that a liquidity regulation was aimed to enhance market functioning—an important role of intermediation during times of stress—means something isn’t calibrated right there.","MS. GEORGE"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","So I’m glad Governor Quarles has raised that issue as something that needs to be addressed.","MS. GEORGE"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I would announce quickly and act quickly to affirm our operational framework for ample reserves and our objectives of rate control.","MS. GEORGE"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I think the sooner we do that,","MS. GEORGE"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","we can put many of the questions and issues behind us about whether there are other things going on.","MS. GEORGE"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","And I was concerned about QE-like issues if we emphasize that we are really supporting the decisions that we made earlier.","MS. GEORGE"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I think we shuffled the cards here.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","the overarching issue that stuck in my mind was the tremendous amount of uncertainty that remains regarding the dynamics that drove this,","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","and that really shapes how I think about the potential actions in moving forward and how we should consider these policies.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","Let me start with the two options that were offered as the potential strategies.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","rapid Treasury purchases covered with supplemental term repos,","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I do believe this offers a pathway for achieving our coming close to the September benchmark.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","And I have confidence that this can be executed,","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I am concerned about the signal that this could potentially send.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","It could trigger several lines of thought that could be potentially destabilizing for the economy.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","As some have noted—as pretty much everyone has noted—it could lead people to think that we are engaging in QE again,","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","because of some concerns that the economy is weaker than the top-line numbers might suggest.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","because the action that we will do will be at the scale comparable to what we did in QE,","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","and it would last for several months.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","A second possibility is that some could see this as analogous to the financial market breakdowns that preceded the Great Recession,","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","and neither of these would be good,","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","and so the strategy would rely heavily on our communications to make the point that this is not actually what’s driving things.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I came into the discussion feeling pretty nervous about this.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I think that the discussion today has made me a little more confident that we can accomplish this.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I do believe that the speed at which this volatility emerged gives us a real opportunity to say,","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I would just say that the second strategy leaves me really concerned,","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","because it relies heavily on the consistent engagement of primary dealers.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","The memos and the discussion today have made it pretty clear that support from this group is not rock solid,","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","and so a strategy that relies on them gives me some pause.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I would “lean toward,” and support,","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","faster-paced Treasury security purchases and moving more dramatically.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","And I would echo a point that was made by a number of people:","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","Let’s figure out how we get to the desired level as fast as possible.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","and others to try to front-load this really has some appeal to me.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","the larger the possibility that there is some confusion or conflicting narratives that emerge.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I would share the concern or the question about the focus on a September benchmark as a focal point for a level of reserves that we should move forward.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I really question why we would be comfortable there,","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","particularly because the events that triggered the current crisis were modest and were fully predictable.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","what would happen if something larger happens or if something unpredicted happens?","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I fear that we could be right back in this circus.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I think that there’s some value in having additional buffer above and beyond that September level,","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","and I think this would be prudent.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","And that comes back to the uncertainty.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","There is still a lot that we have to learn,","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I think there would be value in us not trying to be so precise in identifying a level.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","that an important part of this communication should focus on the real uncertainty that exists in the marketplace,","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","and that we are learning as we go.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","and so this should not be expected to be the last adjustment that we make but rather an evolution toward a deeper understanding of the market and getting us to an optimal policy stance.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","So it’s great to be in the majority again.","MS. MESTER"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","[Laughter] I am fully supportive of moving—","MS. MESTER"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","controlling the funds rate and being able to make sure that we don’t have spikes in these money market rates is the highest priority.","MS. MESTER"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","And also demonstrating that we have that control is very important, as President Rosengren said.","MS. MESTER"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","Controlling the narrative is in our hands here,","MS. MESTER"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","and we have an opportunity to do that.","MS. MESTER"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","This is very consistent with what Vice Chair Williams said.","MS. MESTER"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","We said we were going to be looking at how market interest rates were going and how reserves were being distributed across the system,","MS. MESTER"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","and that’s what we’ve been doing.","MS. MESTER"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","And what we’ve learned is that perhaps we need a higher level of reserves than we thought,","MS. MESTER"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","and maybe we need higher buffers than we thought,","MS. MESTER"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","given that events can actually change the desired levels that any one bank will have.","MS. MESTER"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I just would point out that the distributional issues mean that there is a lot of uncertainty about what the aggregate level of reserves is going to be needed,","MS. MESTER"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","and that’s something else that we learned.","MS. MESTER"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","So I do think that we have to take some actions here even if we’d like banks to be doing it for us,","MS. MESTER"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","and the actions laid out seem to be appropriate ones.","MS. MESTER"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","because the underrun in April next year suggests that maybe we should get levels up sooner rather than later and higher than what’s suggested in the memos.","MS. MESTER"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","In terms of communications, I would communicate as soon as we feasibly can.","MS. MESTER"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I think this gives us the best chance to separate this from a decision on monetary policy if we do it well ahead of the October meeting.","MS. MESTER"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I’m not concerned with engendering a sense of urgency,","MS. MESTER"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","as one of the reasons to go later.","MS. MESTER"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I already think the markets have a sense of urgency here,","MS. MESTER"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","and going in and addressing it,","MS. MESTER"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","could actually be calming to the markets and reassuring to the markets.","MS. MESTER"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I don’t think it would actually be viewed badly.","MS. MESTER"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","And it also means we’d be able to control the narrative.","MS. MESTER"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","In terms of communicating the level—the September level or a dollar level—I would be circumspect,","MS. MESTER"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","because we don’t really know how much we’re going to be needing to do.","MS. MESTER"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","So I think the message has got to be,","MS. MESTER"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","and this is a plan for addressing it.","MS. MESTER"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","And we will continue to monitor things and go back in as needed to make sure that we are supplying the level of reserves that’s necessary.” And if I were doing the communications,","MS. MESTER"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I would actually do a statement,","MS. MESTER"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","but I also would put out FAQs,","MS. MESTER"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","because you can then take all the questions that you think you’re going to be getting and write them out,","MS. MESTER"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","so that people will be able to understand.","MS. MESTER"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I’d also like to thank the staff for the work that they have done to help us prepare for the discussion and the many discussions I have had with our staff to better understand the situation.","MS. BOWMAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","In the short time that I’ve been on the Until last month,","MS. BOWMAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","we had seen some volatility surrounding these events.","MS. BOWMAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","But nothing compared with what we saw in September.","MS. BOWMAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","Since then, we’ve learned a few things.","MS. BOWMAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I think that we are much closer than I thought to the minimum level of reserves sufficient to maintain control over the federal funds rate.","MS. BOWMAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","we have learned that repo rates can move significantly in response to the lack of supply and an increased demand for overnight funding,","MS. BOWMAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","and that this was a surprise to both us and to the markets.","MS. BOWMAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","And we saw those rates influence other short-term funding markets.","MS. BOWMAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","this indicates that we need to try to understand and narrow down the potential causes,","MS. BOWMAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","whether it was the level of the balance sheet,","MS. BOWMAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","the result of post-crisis regulation as Governor Quarles and Presidents Harker and Bullard have described,","MS. BOWMAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","it appears that we have come close to the lowest comfortable level of reserves,","MS. BOWMAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","it’s wise to consider increasing the size of our balance sheet before year- end.","MS. BOWMAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","with the limited information available,","MS. BOWMAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","if asked to choose among the options that the staff proposed,","MS. BOWMAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","my preference would be for the second option,","MS. BOWMAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","which combines the slower pace of Treasury bill purchases with increased overnight and term repo operations.","MS. BOWMAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","This option seems more straightforward to communicate,","MS. BOWMAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","and it minimizes the risk that our actions are disruptive to the short-term Treasury securities markets.","MS. BOWMAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","the smaller monthly purchases may be less likely to be linked with quantitative easing if we can communicate clearly.","MS. BOWMAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I think we should consider the advanced scheduling of overnight and term repo market operations to be held on three dates or during time frames when we anticipate these markets will face pressures because of quarterly tax filings or the size of our balance sheet.","MS. BOWMAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","If we find we don’t need them, we could phase them out over time.","MS. BOWMAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","it would also be helpful for us to reconsider what we think the minimum comfortable level of reserves is,","MS. BOWMAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","incorporating our experiences of the past few weeks into the staff’s ongoing research in this area.","MS. BOWMAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I would prefer a level that could be sustained without frequent discussion points or interventions,","MS. BOWMAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I’d also like to see further analysis from the staff on whether these events were partly the result of changes to financial supervision or regulation.","MS. BOWMAN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","Like many others, I support the faster plan on Lorie’s chart, graph 7.","MR. KASHKARI"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I worry that it’s a little too conservative,","MR. KASHKARI"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","and that the cost of being too conservative far outweighs the cost of being more aggressive.","MR. KASHKARI"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","And so I would err on the side of being less specific about the level of reserves and erring on the side that we don’t run into some kind of problem at year-end,","MR. KASHKARI"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","just so that we do this one and done,","MR. KASHKARI"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","and that we bridge ourselves to whatever our long-term solution is.","MR. KASHKARI"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I think that I am the outlier in being less in favor of a midmeeting announcement.","MR. KASHKARI"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I guess my reaction is, that seems highly unusual.","MR. KASHKARI"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I don’t know the last time the Committee put out a formal statement between meetings.","MR. KASHKARI"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I don’t know the answer to that.","MR. KASHKARI"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","That feels like a strategy to maximize attention on this.","MR. KASHKARI"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","And if we’re trying to signal that this is a technical procedure,","MR. KASHKARI"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","just for monetary policy implementation,","MR. KASHKARI"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","in my mind it does the opposite of that.","MR. KASHKARI"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","It’s calling maximum attention to it.","MR. KASHKARI"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","adjusting the federal funds rate,","MR. KASHKARI"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","it would strike me that we could announce this concurrent with our normal FOMC meeting,","MR. KASHKARI"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","and this would be more technical in nature,","MR. KASHKARI"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","rather than maximizing the spotlight on any notion that we’re doing something profound here.","MR. KASHKARI"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","The Committee hasn’t done intermeeting in a very, very long time.","MR. KASHKARI"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I’m the only person who appears to have that view,","MR. KASHKARI"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","so there is the wisdom of crowds.","MR. KASHKARI"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I’ll turn to the ceiling facility.","MR. KASHKARI"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I am in favor of serious consideration of a ceiling facility.","MR. KASHKARI"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I think one thing that I have learned in this is that the discount window is hopelessly stigmatized.","MR. KASHKARI"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I thought that the stigma was because we had a penalty rate,","MR. KASHKARI"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","markets just blew through the penalty rate and didn’t even look at it.","MR. KASHKARI"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","And so I think we do need some type of ceiling facility.","MR. KASHKARI"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","But this comes back to, what do we mean by “ample reserves” or “abundant reserves”?","MR. KASHKARI"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","If we design the system so that the ceiling facility is never going to be used,","MR. KASHKARI"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","So somehow we need to have a very robust conversation about how frequently we expect that ceiling facility to be utilized.","MR. KASHKARI"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","because then we’re going to be right back where we are right now.","MR. KASHKARI"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","We need to accommodate the fact that it will be regularly utilized,","MR. KASHKARI"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","so that people do not view that as a sign of weakness.","MR. KASHKARI"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","It’s just a sign of regular monetary policy implementation.","MR. KASHKARI"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","So we may end up in ample but not abundant reserves—we’ll have to have a robust discussion about that.","MR. KASHKARI"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","my view would be as wide a range of counterparties as we can get comfortable with,","MR. KASHKARI"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","so that we don’t have this disintermediation problem.","MR. KASHKARI"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","our primary goal has to be to maintain good control of the policy rate and effective transmission to other money markets in the financial system.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","Our secondary goal should be a parsimonious operating framework that accommodates swings in nonreserve liabilities and other changes in supplies and demands without necessitating frequent,","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","large open market operations or risking spikes in the funds rate.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","we should aim for simplicity and clarity to the greatest extent possible to separate these technical execution issues from communications about the stance of monetary policy.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","Those principles led me in November and December of last year to favor ensuring,","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","what is really abundant reserves such that we can be confident that the amount of reserves is more than adequate to meet demand and,","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","provide effective interest rate control.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I don’t believe that there are any merits to probing for the lowest level of reserves,","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","particularly in a late- cycle environment when markets are fragile and prone to volatility and misinterpretation.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","And this is simply repeating, I think, what I said earlier.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","The process of probing for the kink between the flat and steep part of the demand curve or for the lowest efficient level of reserves is likely to be fraught.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","It will necessarily entail spikes in federal funds rate volatility.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","New operations would be needed to contain that volatility,","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","what we’ve been observing over the past few weeks.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","would like to see an option 1 prime,","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","perhaps option 1 as amended by Presidents Rosengren,","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","It would be good to see what a more aggressive rebuilding strategy would look like,","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","perhaps going beyond bills to short coupon securities.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","so I would like to see proactive and creating a framework rather than being reactive to market developments and relying for a prolonged period on ad hoc operations.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","but I do worry that it looks like we will be relying to a greater extent on more reactive,","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","ad hoc operations than an abundant-reserves or an ample-reserves regime would seem to imply.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I think I will make President Kashkari slightly less of an outlier.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I had similar kind of instincts when I first saw these options,","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","there’s not a huge gap between when we would be able to make this decision and when we have our FOMC meeting.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","But the perception of going out of cycle might put this more in the realm of looking like we’re responding to some kind of financial-stability concerns or that this really is an emergency.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","And, in fact, this just goes to the core of our execution of monetary policy.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I think it’s an opportunity for the FOMC,","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","“This is what an ample-reserves regime looks like,","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","and that is why we’re building up the level of reserves—to amply satisfy demand.” So,","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","just in terms of—it is a difficult communication.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","would prefer to see the Chair be able to incorporate it into a press conference statement,","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","because that allows us to distinguish between what is an execution decision and a stance-of-policy decision.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I do agree with those who have said it does need to be a separate statement.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","And then, finally, I think I agree with President Bostic.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I found the September reference point a little confusing until Governor Clarida explained the connection to previous communications.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","it would have seemed more natural to say,","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","“We actually have gone out and offered operations,","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","and the level of demand is clearly at the upper end of the range of So let me just conclude by saying “Thank you” to Vice Chair Williams and to the staff across the System.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I know this has been a real sprint,","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","and I appreciate all of the work that’s been done.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","And thank you for an exceptionally good set of comments from everybody.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","but I think there’s also a consensus that I see in that on some fundamental aspects of a plan.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","And I’ll come back to that at the end.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","Let me offer a couple of comments in the meantime.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","we made a decision to continue what we called an “ample-reserves framework,” and we defined that as meaning that we wouldn’t be going in and out of the market with open market operations with any frequency.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","And we thought about that for years, and there were risks to making that decision.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","But we made it, and we explained it clearly, and it was well accepted.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I think all of the risk now is to the credibility of that decision.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","We now need to follow through on that decision robustly,","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","and that’s where the risk is now.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","as it might have been before we made the decision.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","if you think about what the right level of reserves is—I think this is something we need to fine-tune a little bit,","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","but the idea of early September may not be quite right.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","The idea of current operations,","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I think the market will need a focal point,","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","and language like “at least,” “a bit above,” “learning as we go,” “uncertainty”—stressing all of those things are healthy.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","But I do think we need something like that.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","And, of course, let’s agree that we really don’t know.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","you think the equilibrium level is,","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","the volatility around that number is much faster and much bigger than I guess I had intuited.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","So that means we’re going to be using a lot of language that’s not so much about a level as about the framework and that sort of thing.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","there’s a long list of things that can affect—in a downward direction—the demand for reserves,","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","and that includes daylight overdrafts,","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","it includes changes to our Payment System Risk (PSR) policy,","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","it includes internal liquidity stress tests,","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","it includes the issue of Treasuries and reserves and the related issue of having a standing repo facility.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","the other liabilities—Lorie mentioned this at the beginning,","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","the foreign repo pool and the Treasury General Account (TGA).","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","The TGA we think of as—I mean, it’s so big.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","We think of it as not part of this—because it’s really the Treasury’s call and all that.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","But it’s so big and it can move so much.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I think it’s worth thinking about whether there aren’t ways to somehow manage its outsized effects on reserves.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","So there’s a lot that can be going on in the meantime.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","None of it is going to help us by year-end, or not much of it.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","So I think the actual answer may be quite different than what we think it is now,","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","which again stresses the need for not being too precise.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I think this is a question that we have all been thinking about a lot,","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","and I think the pros and cons were articulated very well by various people.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I’ll give you the three reasons for going before the meeting.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","it really creates a separation from the monetary policy decision we make one way or the other at the end of October.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","right now we’re right where we need to be with markets.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","If we don’t do anything for three and a half weeks—25 days or 26 days—I suspect there will be,","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","“Where are they?” So pretty soon we’ll be “behind the curve.” The third thing As both Lael and Neel pointed out,","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","doing something off-cycle does draw attention to it.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","if you listened to what Thomas said—and this isn’t in what was handed out,","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","“One approach would be to state that you will be conducting outright purchases and term repo operations as necessary to achieve and maintain your desired level of reserves","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","you will continue to offer overnight repo operations to mitigate the risk of money market pressures that could adversely affect the implementation of monetary policy.",". ."
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","Specific amounts for the pace of outright purchases and the size and other terms of term and overnight repo operations could then be announced by the Desk and adjusted over time.” So there’s a little bit of a separation of the FOMC decision with the implementation note,",". ."
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","and I think that may help break the link to QE.",". ."
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","We’re going to have to just “repetitively repeat”—that seems to be the phrase of the day—that it’s not QE,",". ."
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","and I think we can make that sale.",". ."
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","So waiting has its costs, too.",". ."
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I was on that team until the past couple of days,",". ."
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","and now I think I’ve persuaded myself that—but anyway,",". ."
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","in the course of this meeting,",". ."
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","we didn’t know how this was going to go,",". ."
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","so I actually think there’s a basis to move forward with a plan that we would draw up and then send out to people early next week.",". ."
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","If people would rather not do that and do it by notation vote,",". ."
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I sort of sense it would be better to have the second call.",". ."
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","So, after this, I’ll open it up for questions and comments on that.",". ."
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","that I would probably not leave to Q&A in my Tuesday speech.",". ."
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I think I would drop a couple of pages in at the end of the speech,",". ."
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I think it could foreshadow the decision that we then make on Friday,",". ."
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","drawing away from the undesirable shock-and-awe factor a little bit,",". ."
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","The plan would be some pace of asset purchases that covers the consensus of the Committee.",". ."
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","There were “slowers,” there were “faster pluses,” but I think we’ll be somewhere in the middle,",". ."
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","So I’ll put that out as a possible way to proceed,",". ."
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","do you have something that you wanted to add to that?",". ."
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","So I’ll stop there and offer the opportunity for discussion and comment.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","This has been a really helpful discussion.","VICE CHAIR WILLIAMS"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I want to, again, thank the teams here—Washington, the Board—who worked tirelessly.","VICE CHAIR WILLIAMS"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","They now have heard that they are going to be working tirelessly a little bit longer,","VICE CHAIR WILLIAMS"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","but I think this discussion has been really helpful in our thinking and understanding further all of these issues in a constructive way.","VICE CHAIR WILLIAMS"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","the staff has not only been working tirelessly on developing these plans,","VICE CHAIR WILLIAMS"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","they’ve also been tirelessly working on turning me into a true New Yorker.","VICE CHAIR WILLIAMS"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","So I have here my statement of where my loyalties lie.","VICE CHAIR WILLIAMS"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","“lack of love” for the Dodgers,","VICE CHAIR WILLIAMS"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","the message that we have this plan that gets us to what I would call a “true ample-reserves framework” by April of next year.","VICE CHAIR WILLIAMS"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","And I think that does require us,","VICE CHAIR WILLIAMS"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","to say what “good” looked like.","VICE CHAIR WILLIAMS"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","And what “good” looked like is,","VICE CHAIR WILLIAMS"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","early September or earlier than that when we didn’t see interest rates spiking all over or these signs of stress.","VICE CHAIR WILLIAMS"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","So there’s got to be a way for us to communicate what “good” looks like here is,","VICE CHAIR WILLIAMS"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","the administered rates doing most of the work,","VICE CHAIR WILLIAMS"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","that any open market operations would either be a standing facility or infrequent use of those,","VICE CHAIR WILLIAMS"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","and really just have a system that is a very coherent strategy.","VICE CHAIR WILLIAMS"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","the important part of this communication beyond what we are going to do over the next few weeks.","VICE CHAIR WILLIAMS"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","Jay, this is Tom, and I think I’m speaking for Eric.","MR. BARKIN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","We’re more than comfortable with the notational vote.","MR. BARKIN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I’m not sure we need another long meeting to debate a simple plan.","MR. BARKIN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","But maybe others would think differently.","MR. BARKIN"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I don’t think I need to have more discussions.","MS. DALY"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","This was a very helpful discussion.","MS. DALY"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","Anyone dying to have the call?","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I’m great with a notation vote as well.","MS. MESTER"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","Our feelings are not hurt, don’t worry.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","Could I just ask—maybe I wasn’t paying enough attention.","MR. EVANS"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","The notation vote is going to be—what’s likely to be put in front of us?","MR. EVANS"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","We’re going to put a plan together and probably be in discussion with people during the course of doing that.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","And it’ll have asset purchases, it’ll have the timing of them, it’ll have—Thomas, do you want to flesh that out?","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","So, basically, it would be a short FOMC statement together with a revised directive.","MR. LAUBACH"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","And, again, the FOMC statement—that’s going to be the art here, right?","MR. LAUBACH"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","How do you, with finesse, take into account—for example—the issues that you raised about giving some reference points to markets, without locking in too much into one?","MR. LAUBACH"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","How to explain these things as, in some sense, making up for a certain level.","MR. LAUBACH"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","So that’s basically what we’ll be working on, and we would send something as soon as possible.","MR. LAUBACH"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","Yes, send it out for comment and then later for a vote.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","Let me come back to the timing issue that Neel and Lael raised.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","we don’t know what we’re going to do on monetary policy at the October meeting,","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","but if you’re in a situation in which you’re cutting and you’re also announcing this,","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I don’t know how the headline doesn’t be “Fed Cuts Rates,","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","Restarts Asset Purchases.” For all the talking you do,","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I just think it would be so hard to break that link,","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","because there’s just too much news.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","You know, this is a coin flipper.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","Anyway, that’s what I worry about.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","after I speak—and John will speak,","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I guess—they’ll know it’s coming,","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","and they may be speculating that it might be coming sooner,","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","and then it should reduce the drama of the thing if it’s already been heavily foreshadowed.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","Any other comments or questions?","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","[No response] So everybody is good with this?","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","and separating it more from the FOMC meeting is probably a good idea.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I don’t know if we could get a midweek vote or something.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","Not that I want to press people too hard,","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","but we already had the discussion here,","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","and probably a proposal that takes into account some of the comments here could be approved relatively rapidly,","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","You know, I want to get this right.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I mean, October 11 is before people are expecting, and if we could just—it’s only a week.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I’d like to keep that if we could.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I want to get this done carefully—there will be time for a little bit of back-and-forth with you guys, with all of us, and so if I can hold to that.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","A couple of days shouldn’t matter that much.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I appreciate your suggestion, Jim.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","So does that mean the proposal would go out at a week from now, or does that mean that the announcement would be made?","MR. BULLARD"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","So we’d have a week to look at it and approve.","MR. BULLARD"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","Well, you won’t have a full week.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","No, but you’d have next week to circulate.","MR. BULLARD"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I think we’ll be shooting paper at you—what?","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","And then you’ll be reacting to it, and we’ll be coming together around something and voting on it and announcing it on Friday.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I appreciate your comments about previewing it so that it dials down the intensity of this intermeeting statement.","MR. KASHKARI"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I’m just curious—Thomas or Jim or anybody, off the top of your head, do you remember the last time the Committee put out an intermeeting statement?","MR. KASHKARI"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","And what were the circumstances?","MR. KASHKARI"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","In May 2010, there was an announcement in the context of swap lines.","MR. LAUBACH"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","The last time that you announced an intermeeting decision in terms of the funds rate was October 2008.","MR. LAUBACH"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","That was the coordinated policy rate cut across a number of central banks.","MR. LAUBACH"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","So just to clarify: The notation vote on Friday could be on a proposal along the lines of the reserve projections with faster bill purchases?","MR. EVANS"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","Is that what we’re talking about—$60 billion per month could be a possibility?","MR. EVANS"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","Let us take away the notes of what everybody said, but something in line with that.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","But I think we’re going to be thinking about all of the things people said here today and trying to incorporate—","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","Okay—as opposed to just sort of a holding statement in which the FOMC has indicated that we intend to be doing more and provides some guidance on that and allows","MR. EVANS"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","We’ll make a decision, and we’ll announce it, but as I mentioned, the part I read out of Thomas’s statement suggests that the Desk will be making the specific numerical announcements—kind of thing.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","Do you want to comment on that, Thomas?","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","It would seem to me that there are some advantages, as I think many of you mentioned you would like to emphasize the need to remain flexible and to make adjustments as you learn more.","MR. LAUBACH"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","You know, if the Committee statement outlines the high-level intention, then the specific numbers could be in the Desk statement and thereby easier to adjust, if that was appropriate.","MR. LAUBACH"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","That might be an attractive way to go.","MR. LAUBACH"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","We’ll make a proposal to you on that.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","but not until we release the minutes of it,","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","along with the October meeting.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","Just making sure everyone understands that.","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","and then I think people should be careful to stick with that or stay away from it—stick with the basic talking points on it if you’re speaking next week,","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","but also stick to a very basic form of the message,","CHAIR POWELL"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","Can I just make one suggestion in that regard?","MS. BRAINARD"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","It would be beneficial for either the Desk or Jim to circulate talking points or a Q&A, which everybody can use, because I think in this intermeeting period there has been very little guidance.","MS. BRAINARD"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","And so, you know, it’s better for consistency if you could tell us every day or every few days what the standing line is, I think.","MS. BRAINARD"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","Chair, just FYI—I have an interview this afternoon on CNBC, but I will stay away from this.","MS. MESTER"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","I’m sure there’s a lot of other things to talk about, too.","MS. MESTER"
"2019-10-04","Conference Call","So that sounds like a plan to me.","CHAIR POWELL"

"2018-03-21","Q&A","you’re right that the outlook did improve,",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","as I mentioned and as you—as was in your question.",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","The Committee’s estimates of growth went up,",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","the Committee’s estimates of unemployment went down,",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","and there was a very slight increase in inflation.",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","essentially—if you think back to the era after the crisis,",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","You’ve only seen very gradual upward pressures on inflation and wages despite that very large increase.",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","And that suggests that the relationship between changes in slack and inflation is not so tight.",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","But, it has diminished, but it’s still there.",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","So I think when you see those small changes in unemployment,",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","the flatness of the Phillips curve,",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","to take the middle ground there.",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","the risk would be that we wait too really doesn’t get sustainably up to 2 percent,",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","that will hurt us going forward.",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","we need to make sure that inflation expectations are anchored at 2 percent.",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","So we’re trying to take that middle ground,",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","and the Committee continues to believe that the middle ground consists of further gradual increases in the federal funds rate as long as the economy is broadly on this path.",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","the—what we’ve said in the longer-run statement of goals and monetary policy strategy is that we would be concerned with sustained or persistent deviations of inflation either above or below.",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","We’ve also said—in minutes and in speeches and things like that—that that is a symmetric objective.",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","So, that’s how we think of it.",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","I think it’s—I wouldn’t characterize what we’ve done over the last five years as tolerating,",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","We were always pushing toward 2 percent,",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","and I think that is how we look at it.",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","I can’t give you an exact number.",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","It just, you know, it, we haven’t agreed on that.",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","It just is that we’re always going to be seeking 2 percent unemployment from its goal.",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","And—and also, just the duration of it as well.",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","You know, let me say what that really is.",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","So the Summary of Economic Projections is really a compilation of the individual rate forecasts.",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","The Committee made really one decision at this meeting,",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","and that was to raise the federal funds rate by 25 basis points.",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","The Summary of Economic Projections is individual forecasts compiled and written down.",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","And, you’ve identified the median as 2.7 percent.",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","I would—and that’s an interesting statistic.",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","I would also say that the central tendency is interesting.",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","The full range is interesting.",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","So you have a range of views around the table.",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","One of the great benefits of our system is that we do have Reserve Banks with their own staffs and Governors with different views,",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","and so we discuss these things.",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","So the Committee doesn’t vote or agree upon the medians,",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","so you’re going to have a range of views.",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","That’s really all I can say—2.7 just happens to be the median for ’18,",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","You know, I would say it’s hard to say, but it would take—you know, that is well above almost all estimates, current estimates of potential long-run growth.",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","So I guess I’d start by saying that the natural rate of unemployment is not something that we can observe directly.",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","We look at a wide range of indicators on that—you know,",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","I think we all understand that any point estimate is surrounded by very wide uncertainty bands.",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","So as the—as the actual unemployment rate has declined from 10 percent to 4.1 percent,",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","the Committee’s median estimate of the natural rate of unemployment has also declined by a full percentage point.",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","So the Committee—and, I think, people—are generally influenced by data.",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","As they see unemployment going lower,",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","they’re looking at a variety of aspects of the labor market,",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","including wage inflation and price inflation.",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","we—we’re mindful of the uncertainty of that,",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","So, as—if inflation—if unemployment does continue to go down, we’ll continue to do that.",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","there is no—there’s no sense in the data that we’re on the cusp of an acceleration of inflation.",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","We have seen moderate increases in wages and price inflation,",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","and we seem to be seeing more of that.",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","I guess the idea—the theory would be that if you get below the sustainable rate of unemployment for a sustained",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","Longer-run values like the neutral rate of interest,",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","the natural rate of unemployment,",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","the potential growth rate of the economy are pinned down by slow- moving forces over time.",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","So they don’t—they don’t move around very much.",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","So I wouldn’t expect the Committee’s,",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","predictions or projections or estimates of those values to move quickly.",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","So is it possible that the neutral rate of interest would move up because of,",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","There’s literature that says that.",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","There’s—there are reasons that that might be the case.",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","in the—in the median at this time.",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","the Committee sees the neutral rate of interest as still quite low and is not—is not seeing it as having moved up and is open to the possibility that it will.",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","So that’s something that I’m going to be carefully considering.",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","I have not made a decision about it.",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","My colleagues and I are committed to communicating as clearly as possible about what we’re doing and why we’re doing it.",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","I would want to think very carefully about it and make sure that no one would take more",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","in terms of the balance sheet,",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","we carefully developed this plan.",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","We carefully socialized it in a series of meetings last year.",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","and we said we wouldn’t change it,",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","unless there were a significant downturn that required,",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","meaningful reductions in interest rates.",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","And I have no inclination to revisit that.",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","We’re going to use monetary policy as the principle tool of adjusting,",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","a number of participants in this FOMC did bring up the issue of tariffs,",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","and if I could summarize what came out of that,",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","that changes in trade policy should have any effect on the current outlook.",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","is that a number of participants reported in—about their conversations with business leaders around the country and reported that trade policy has become a concern going forward for that group.",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","So we look at the staff forecasts and the Board forecasts—and,",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","there are 12 excellent Reserve Bank staffs who have their own views and do their own work—we look at those as informing the decisions of the policymakers.",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","So—and it’s really the policymakers’ views that we talk about in the",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","into the SEP and particularly in the changes over the course of last year and this year.",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","And individual policymakers went through,",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","and did their own thinking and came up with their own estimates and submitted those as their Summary of Economic Projections—as their projections.",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","Those are not the staff’s projections.",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","appropriate, but clearly something was holding a number of the FOMC members back.",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","Is it concerns about these potential trade tariffs that are going into effect?",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","Is it just that people want to wait and see a little longer before they raise?",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","Can you give us some more insight into why people didn’t go to four this time—the median—even though the economic projections look very healthy?",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","I would go back to the thought that,",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","we made one decision at this meeting,",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","and that decision was to raise the federal funds rate by 25 basis points.",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","The projections are really just individual projections that are submitted and then compiled.",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","you’re mentioning the median as being,",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","those forecasts will change over time,",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","and they’ll change depending on the way the outlook for the economy changes.",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","So that’s really all I can say.",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","these are the best forecasts that people could make,",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","it could be that if the economy’s a little bit stronger or a little bit weaker,",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","then the path could be a little less gradual or a little more gradual.",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","what I mentioned is that our FOMC participants reported in that they had heard,",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","And they’re seeing it as a risk-to-the-outlook kind of thing.",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","So—and the kind of things people are talking about would be,",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","more widespread retaliation and more widespread actions back-and-forth kind of thing.",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","I can’t be any more specific than that.",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","has been very weak since the financial crisis.",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","It’s averaged only about 0.5 percent a year for the last six years, I guess.",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","and it would certainly be a good thing to see it move up.",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","It has moved up just a little bit but not, kind of, decisively.",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","And, you know, you asked me about fiscal policy and the connection to productivity.",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","I think in the tax bill there’s—there are incentives for—there—a tax cut bill that allows expensing of investments should encourage additional investment that should encourage productivity.",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","an individual tax bill that lowers tax rates should encourage more labor force participation.",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","So I do think it’s very important that we have a focus on productivity in the country.",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","It’s not something that we can really do at the Fed,",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","we’re certainly hopeful that there will be supply-side effects like that from the tax bill.",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","I think estimates are really all over the place in terms of the amount and the timing of those.",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","I would say that—remember that forecasts three years out—so,",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","in 2020 there’s a—I think it’s 3.4 percent is the median of the SEP dots for 2020,",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","which is 40 basis points above the estimates of the neutral rate,",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","which I would characterize as,",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","but that’s three years in the future.",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","we don’t have the ability to see that far into the future,",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","so I really wouldn’t put a lot in that.",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","You could imagine narratives in which that would make sense,",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","but I honestly I wouldn’t put too much on that.",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","Sorry, your second question was?",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","we’ve been through many years of growth around 2 percent,",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","and I’ve given a number of public remarks where I’ve called on,",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","the country to focus more on potential growth and productivity and labor force participation,",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","I think it’s really important that we do something—do what we can as a country to increase our potential growth rate.",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","I would say in the bill that passed Congress,",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","there were elements that should encourage productivity,",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","We don’t know how big those effects are going to be.",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","We don’t know what will be large.",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","Our current framework for implementing monetary policy is working very well.",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","We have excellent control over rates, and it’s working.",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","And it’s— you described it accurately.",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","We haven’t made a decision to keep that as our longer-run framework.",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","We haven’t really addressed that question.",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","We’ve had meetings where we’ve talked about it, and we’ve agreed that it’s working well.",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","But it’s—and it’s not something I see us as needing to urgently address.",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","I think we’re continuing to learn about this framework.",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","the size of the balance sheet is going to depend on the public’s demand for our liabilities,",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","So we don’t know what the demand is for reserves in a world where you have—you know,",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","you have regulations that require banks to hold lots of high-quality liquid assets,",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","and reserves are one of those.",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","So it’s not something we’re looking at resolving in the near term.",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","pay interest on excess reserves that are—is above the general level of short-term interest rates.",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","So we’re paying rates that banks can get from other interest rates from other—any other investment in the short-term money markets.",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","In addition, remember that those liabilities—those are our liabilities.",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","The assets that we have on the other side are Treasury securities and mortgage-backed securities,",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","which yield much higher than interest on reserves.",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","So, in fact, it’s not a subsidy, and it’s not a cost to the taxpayer.",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","we’ve been monitoring financial conditions and financial stability issues very carefully,",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","and the FOMC receives regular briefings about the staff framework and,",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","measures of various aspects of financial—financial stability risks,",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","and the current view of the Committee is that financial stability vulnerabilities are moderate,",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","And I’ll go through a couple of pieces of that.",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","if you look at the banking system,",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","particularly the large financial institutions,",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","You see much higher liquidity.",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","You see them more aware of their risks and better able to manage them with stress testing.",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","And if one—if something does go wrong,",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","you’ve got—you’ve got better ability to deal with the failure of those institutions.",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","So, therefore, you don’t see high leverage.",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","You don’t see excess risk-taking in great quantity the way you did see levels of borrowing,",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","And, of course, default rates are very low.",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","I should mention also that for large financial institutions,",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","they’re no longer funded by a lot of short-term wholesale funding,",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","which can disappear very quickly,",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","so they’re far less vulnerable to liquidity issues.",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","Overall, those aspects, I think, suggest low levels of vulnerability.",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","You identified the—really, one area where—which is an area of focus, which is asset prices.",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","So, in some areas, asset prices are elevated relative to their longer-run historical norms.",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","You can think of some equity prices.",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","You can think of commercial real estate prices in certain markets.",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","But we don’t see it in housing, which is key.",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","if you put all of that into a pie,",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","what you have is moderate vulnerabilities,",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","In terms of whether we have the tools,",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","and I think we certainly—we use them.",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","We have—I think the stress test is a really important tool that we have for the largest financial institutions and for the smaller financial institutions.",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","We regularly use that to—as a way to test against various,",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","certainly for the larger institutions.",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","So, this is a matter that Congress has under consideration.",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","It’s not something—so Congress is looking at raising the threshold for applying enhanced financial standards to—from $50 billion to $250 billion,",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","while leaving us with the ability to reach below $250 billion and apply those standards where we think it’s appropriate.",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","we haven’t been shy about doing that,",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","one of the eight SIFIs is below 250 already.",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","So we are fully prepared to do that.",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","But this is a decision that’s in the hands of Congress.",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","It’s not something that’s been—been taken.",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","that passed the Senate did have—did give us the ability to do supervisory stress tests periodically,",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","We haven’t made any decision about that at all.",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","We would want to think very carefully about that,",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","we would—whatever we do decide to do,",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","we’d put that out for comment.",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","Is it, you know, logistically possible?",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","but it’s certainly not something that we’ve decided to do.",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","And the second question you had was?",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","Well, it’s—I guess the next thing on the list would be activities.",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","So, you know, we—regular way commercial banks that do deposit taking and lending and don’t speculate in markets, you know, that’s one business model.",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","Another business model might be, you know, if you think of a hedge fund, right?",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","They’re speculating on markets, and—you know, so very different business models and different levels of risk and that sort of thing.",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","So, that’s—that would be the next thing on the list.",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","Remember that there are 15 FOMC participants,",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","and we—each of us has his or her own forecast.",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","So there’s a real diversity of views on this, particularly on these fiscal issues.",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","participants believe there will be meaningful increases in demand from the new fiscal policies for at least the next,",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","I think there’s a general view as well that supply-side issues—that there could be supply-side effects as well,",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","and you would see that again through higher investment,",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","driven by lower corporate tax rates and the expensing of some investment,",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","which would drive—tend to drive productivity over time.",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","If you make investment more attractive, companies should do more of it.",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","I spent many years of my life working with companies and discussing—and,",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","the cost of capital is one of many factors that they’ll consider.",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","It isn’t the only factor or the principle factor,",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","but it should result in more investment,",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","and investment should drive productivity.",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","At the same time, the—you know, I mentioned labor supply.",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","You should see some labor supply effects over time from lower individual effective tax rates.",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","The whole thing is very know, we’ve all looked at the literature carefully.",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","We’ve discussed it with our in-house experts and come up with our own views,",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","but that’s— I’d say that’s about where the—where the views are.",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","You know, at this stage, what our FOMC participants discussed—it wasn’t—it was—it was just that this is a new risk that had been probably a low- profile risk, which has become, you know, a more prominent risk to the outlook.",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","That’s really what people were saying.",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","They didn’t get into talking about particular—you know, whether it’s inflation or growth or whatever it would be.",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","So that’s not something that did come up.",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","You know—your second question, sorry, was China?",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","we’ve had unemployment decline sharply since,",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","when it peaked at 10 percent and down to 4.1 percent now,",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","and we’ve seen only modest increases in wages.",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","what wages should in theory represent is inflation plus productivity increases.",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","You should get paid for your productivity plus inflation.",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","And productivity’s been very low.",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","So these low wage increases—in a sense, they do make sense in that—from that perspective.",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","as labor markets have tightened,",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","and we hear reports of labor shortages and we see that,",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","groups of unemployed are diminishing,",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","and the unemployment rate is going down,",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","higher wages—wages going up more.",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","And I would—I think I’ve been surprised by that,",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","and I think others have as well.",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","In terms of what’s the right level,",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","I don’t think I have a view on what the right level of wages is,",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","but I think we will—we will know that the labor market is getting tight when we do see a more meaningful upward move in wages.",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","That doesn’t keep me awake at night.",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","We don’t consider the election cycle.",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","we—we’re looking very carefully at our assigned responsibilities of maximum employment,",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","You can count on us to stay focused on the jobs that Congress has assigned us and count on us to use the tools we have to achieve them.",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","You’re right, that’s the highest rate.",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","the 10-year thing a few times these days,",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","and it’s true that rates are higher than they’ve been in 10 years.",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","On the other hand, the economy’s healthier than it’s been since—since before the financial crisis.",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","So, it’s a healthier economy than it’s been in 10 years.",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","The financial crisis, of course, was just really getting going 10 years ago.",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","You know, it’s an interesting question, and there are a range of views there.",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","I think it’s true that yield curves have tended to predict recessions if you look back over many cycles,",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","but a lot of that was just situations in which inflation was allowed to get out of control,",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","and that put the economy into a recession.",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","That’s really not the situation we’re in now,",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","so I don’t know that that’s—I don’t know that—I don’t think that inverted yield curve does to intermediation.",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","It’s hard to find in the research data,",""
"2018-03-21","Q&A","I think those are issues that we’ll be watching carefully.",""
"2018-06-13","Opening Statement","Thanks very much for being here.",""
"2018-06-13","Opening Statement","I know that a number of you will want to talk about the details of our announcement today,",""
"2018-06-13","Opening Statement","and I am happy to do that in a few minutes.",""
"2018-06-13","Opening Statement","But because monetary policy affects everyone,",""
"2018-06-13","Opening Statement","I want to start with a plain-English summary of how the economy is doing,",""
"2018-06-13","Opening Statement","what my colleagues and I at the Federal Reserve are trying to do,",""
"2018-06-13","Opening Statement","The main takeaway is that the economy is doing very well.",""
"2018-06-13","Opening Statement","Most people who want to find jobs are finding them,",""
"2018-06-13","Opening Statement","and unemployment and inflation are low.",""
"2018-06-13","Opening Statement","Interest rates have been low for some years while the economy has been recovering from the financial crisis.",""
"2018-06-13","Opening Statement","we have been gradually raising interest rates,",""
"2018-06-13","Opening Statement","and along the way we’ve tried to explain the reasoning behind our decisions.",""
"2018-06-13","Opening Statement","we think that gradually returning interest rates to a more normal level as the economy strengthens is the best way the Fed can help sustain an environment in which American households and businesses can thrive.",""
"2018-06-13","Opening Statement","we’ve taken another step in that process by raising our target range for the federal funds rate by ¼ of a percentage point.",""
"2018-06-13","Opening Statement","My colleagues and I meet eight times a year and take a fresh look each time at what is happening in the economy and consider whether our policy needs adjusting.",""
"2018-06-13","Opening Statement","We don’t put our interest rate decisions on hold or on autopilot,",""
"2018-06-13","Opening Statement","because the economy can always evolve in unexpected ways.",""
"2018-06-13","Opening Statement","History has shown that moving interest rates either too quickly or too slowly can lead to bad economic outcomes.",""
"2018-06-13","Opening Statement","We think the outcomes are likely to be better overall if we are as clear as possible about what we are likely to do and why.",""
"2018-06-13","Opening Statement","we try to give a sense of our expectations for how the economy will evolve and how our policy stance may change.",""
"2018-06-13","Opening Statement","conference like this after every one of our scheduled FOMC meetings.",""
"2018-06-13","Opening Statement","And we’re going to do that beginning in January.",""
"2018-06-13","Opening Statement","That will give us more opportunities to explain our actions and to answer your questions.",""
"2018-06-13","Opening Statement","I want to point out that having twice as many press conferences does not signal anything about the timing or pace of future interest rate changes.",""
"2018-06-13","Opening Statement","This change is only about improving communications.",""
"2018-06-13","Opening Statement","My FOMC colleagues and I will also continue to issue our economic projections on the existing quarterly schedule.",""
"2018-06-13","Opening Statement","let me go into more detail over developments in the economy,",""
"2018-06-13","Opening Statement","Economic growth appears to have picked up in the current quarter,",""
"2018-06-13","Opening Statement","largely reflecting a bounceback in household spending.",""
"2018-06-13","Opening Statement","Business investment continues to grow strongly, and the overall outlook for growth remains favorable.",""
"2018-06-13","Opening Statement","Several factors support this assessment:",""
"2018-06-13","Opening Statement","Fiscal policy is boosting the economy,",""
"2018-06-13","Opening Statement","ongoing job gains are raising incomes and confidence,",""
"2018-06-13","Opening Statement","foreign economies continue to expand,",""
"2018-06-13","Opening Statement","and overall financial conditions remain accommodative.",""
"2018-06-13","Opening Statement","These observations are consistent with the projections that Committee participants submitted for this meeting.",""
"2018-06-13","Opening Statement","The median projection for the growth of real GDP is 2.8 percent this year,",""
"2018-06-13","Opening Statement","Compared with the projections made in March, this median growth path is little changed.",""
"2018-06-13","Opening Statement","job gains averaged 180,000 per month over the past three months,",""
"2018-06-13","Opening Statement","well above the pace needed in the longer run to provide jobs for new entrants into the workforce.",""
"2018-06-13","Opening Statement","The unemployment rate declined over the past two months and stood at 3.8 percent in May,",""
"2018-06-13","Opening Statement","its lowest level in nearly two decades.",""
"2018-06-13","Opening Statement","Meanwhile, the labor force participation rate has been roughly unchanged since late 2013.",""
"2018-06-13","Opening Statement","given that the aging of our Committee participants’ projections for the unemployment rate stands at 3.6 percent in the fourth quarter of this year and runs at 3.5 percent over the next two years,",""
"2018-06-13","Opening Statement","a percentage point below the median estimate of its longer-run normal rate.",""
"2018-06-13","Opening Statement","This median path is just a bit lower than that from March.",""
"2018-06-13","Opening Statement","After many years of running below our 2 percent longer-run objective,",""
"2018-06-13","Opening Statement","inflation has recently moved close to that level.",""
"2018-06-13","Opening Statement","as measured by the price index for personal consumption expenditures,",""
"2018-06-13","Opening Statement","increased 2 percent over the 12 months ending in April.",""
"2018-06-13","Opening Statement","which excludes prices of energy and food and tends to be a better indicator of future inflation,",""
"2018-06-13","Opening Statement","rose 1.8 percent over the same period.",""
"2018-06-13","Opening Statement","inflation moved up as the unusually low readings from last March dropped out of the calculation.",""
"2018-06-13","Opening Statement","The recent inflation data have been encouraging,",""
"2018-06-13","Opening Statement","but after many years of inflation below our objective,",""
"2018-06-13","Opening Statement","we do not want to declare victory.",""
"2018-06-13","Opening Statement","We want to ensure that inflation remains near our symmetric 2 percent longer-run goal on a sustained basis.",""
"2018-06-13","Opening Statement","As we note in our Statement of Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy,",""
"2018-06-13","Opening Statement","the Committee would be concerned if inflation were running persistently above or below our 2 percent objective.",""
"2018-06-13","Opening Statement","many factors affect inflation—some temporary and others more lasting—and at any given time inflation may be above or below 2 percent.",""
"2018-06-13","Opening Statement","the recent rise in oil prices will likely push inflation somewhat above 2 percent in coming months.",""
"2018-06-13","Opening Statement","But that transitory development should have little,",""
"2018-06-13","Opening Statement","consequence for inflation over the next few years.",""
"2018-06-13","Opening Statement","The median of participants’ projections for inflation runs at 2.1 percent through 2020.",""
"2018-06-13","Opening Statement","Relative to the March projections,",""
"2018-06-13","Opening Statement","the median inflation projection is a little higher this year and next.",""
"2018-06-13","Opening Statement","bringing it to 1¾ to 2 percent.",""
"2018-06-13","Opening Statement","We also made some changes to our policy statement,",""
"2018-06-13","Opening Statement","reflecting that policy normalization is proceeding broadly as we have expected.",""
"2018-06-13","Opening Statement","None of these changes signals a change in our policy views.",""
"2018-06-13","Opening Statement","we removed the language stating that “the federal funds rate is likely to remain,",""
"2018-06-13","Opening Statement","below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run.” Since we introduced that language a few years ago,",""
"2018-06-13","Opening Statement","and the Committee has raised the federal funds rate from near 0 to 1¾ to 2 percent.",""
"2018-06-13","Opening Statement","As we continue to note in our statement,",""
"2018-06-13","Opening Statement","we expect to make further gradual increases in that rate.",""
"2018-06-13","Opening Statement","if the economy evolves broadly as we anticipate,",""
"2018-06-13","Opening Statement","move well within the range of estimates of the normal long-run level.",""
"2018-06-13","Opening Statement","we thought that now is an appropriate time to remove this forward guidance from our policy statement.",""
"2018-06-13","Opening Statement","We continue to believe that a gradual approach for increasing the federal funds rate will best promote a sustained expansion of economic activity,",""
"2018-06-13","Opening Statement","and inflation near our symmetric 2 percent goal.",""
"2018-06-13","Opening Statement","We are aware that raising rates too slowly might raise the risk that monetary policy would need to tighten abruptly down the road in response to an unexpectedly sharp increase in inflation or financial excesses,",""
"2018-06-13","Opening Statement","if we raise interest rates too rapidly,",""
"2018-06-13","Opening Statement","and inflation could continue to run persistently below our objective.",""
"2018-06-13","Opening Statement","The Committee’s gradual approach is reflected in participants’ projections for the appropriate path for the federal funds rate.",""
"2018-06-13","Opening Statement","The median projection for the federal funds rate is 2.4 percent at the end of this year,",""
"2018-06-13","Opening Statement","3.1 percent at the end of 2019,",""
"2018-06-13","Opening Statement","and 3.4 percent at the end of rate edged up this year and next,",""
"2018-06-13","Opening Statement","most participants did not revise their projections.",""
"2018-06-13","Opening Statement","I’ll conclude by mentioning two additional matters.",""
"2018-06-13","Opening Statement","First, our program for reducing our balance sheet, which began in October, is proceeding smoothly.",""
"2018-06-13","Opening Statement","Barring a material and unexpected weakening in the outlook,",""
"2018-06-13","Opening Statement","this program will proceed on schedule,",""
"2018-06-13","Opening Statement","and our balance sheet will continue to shrink.",""
"2018-06-13","Opening Statement","changing the target range for the federal funds rate is our primary means of adjusting the stance of monetary policy.",""
"2018-06-13","Opening Statement","as discussed in the minutes of our May meeting,",""
"2018-06-13","Opening Statement","we’re making a small technical adjustment in one of our tools for implementing monetary policy.",""
"2018-06-13","Opening Statement","To keep the federal funds rate in the target range,",""
"2018-06-13","Opening Statement","we rely on the rate of interest on excess reserves,",""
"2018-06-13","Opening Statement","we have set the IOER rate at the top of the target range for the federal funds rate.",""
"2018-06-13","Opening Statement","the federal funds rate has moved up toward the IOER rate as short-term interest rates have risen more generally.",""
"2018-06-13","Opening Statement","So to move the federal funds rate closer to the middle of the target range,",""
"2018-06-13","Opening Statement","we are now setting the IOER rate 5 basis points below the upper end of the target range.",""
"2018-06-13","Opening Statement","This minor technical adjustment has no bearing on the appropriate path for the federal funds rate or financial conditions more generally.",""
"2018-06-13","Opening Statement","Thanks for listening, and I’ll be",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","So since—I wouldn’t say anything has happened since March to really change the way I’m thinking about inflation or the way the Committee’s thinking about inflation.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","We’ve seen inflation move very gradually up toward our 2 percent objective.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","And part of that has been just idiosyncratic things dropping out from last March,",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","which were holding inflation—measured inflation—down.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","Part of it is just that continued tightening in the labor market and the economy more broadly is pushing inflation up.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","and the Committee continues to think,",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","that we are just about at our 2 percent goal but,",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","not ready to declare victory until we sustain that over time,",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","You also asked about fiscal policy,",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","and there’s a range of views on the Committee and,",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","a range of views among economists generally.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","But I can say that the Committee members—Committee participants—generally believe that the fiscal changes—and that includes both the tax cuts,",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","and the spending changes—will provide meaningful support to demand,",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","significant support to demand over the course of the next three years.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","And the question—the other question is, what about the supply side?",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","So it is—it makes sense that if you lower corporate tax rates and allow faster expensing of investment,",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","you will encourage greater investment.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","That should increase potential output.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","So that really ought to happen as well.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","I think the amounts and the timing of that coming in are also quite uncertain.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","There’s also the possibility that there would be more labor supply from lower individual tax rates,",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","in amounts and in timing that might be more uncertain.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","So that’s how the Committee generally is thinking about—about fiscal policy.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","considered a neutral fed funds rate.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","And I wanted to ask how you’re thinking about what to do once you get to neutral.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","Under what conditions would you decide,",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","that it’s okay to stop raising rates?",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","And under what conditions would you want to keep going?",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","we’ve been far from maximum employment and stable prices,",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","and so the need for accommodative policy has been—has been clear.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","As the economy has strengthened and as we’ve gradually raised interest rates,",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","the question comes into view of,",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","how much longer will you need to be accommodative?",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","How will you know where—at what point policy will be neutral?",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","Neutral meaning that interest rates are neither pushing the economy up nor trying to restrain it.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","So we know that we’re getting closer to that neutral level.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","We don’t have an exact sense of how that will be.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","So the Committee is discussing, very actively, the questions that you raise.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","And, really, it boils down to a question of, what is appropriate policy?",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","And, you know, I—you asked, how will we know?",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","So I think we’ll be very carefully looking at incoming data on inflation,",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","We have to acknowledge that there are always wide uncertainty bands around the level of,",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","the natural rate of unemployment.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","But also, what is the neutral rate of interest?",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","What is that rate of interest that pushes neither up nor down?",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","So I think we— we’ll be guided by incoming data on the economy and try to keep our minds open as we move forward.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","You know, the—our target for—our medium-term objective for inflation is 2 percent PCE inflation.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","We feel that that target has served the economy well,",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","and I’m strongly committed to it.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","The Committee is strongly committed to it.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","The sort of barriers to making a material change to that would be—would be very high because,",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","You asked about price-level targeting and that sort of thing.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","there are some ideas that sort of take cognizance of the fact that rates are lower,",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","we’re near the zero lower bound,",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","and that could put downward pressure on inflation expectations if we’re going to be down at the zero lower bound and,",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","sort of undermine the credibility of the 2 percent inflation objective.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","So the idea is to have kind of a makeup.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","If you—if you’re below target for a while,",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","you have a—you have a time of being above target.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","And the idea is to enhance the credibility of that 2 percent—that 2 percent target.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","This is an idea that’s been written about for many years.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","It’s not something that the Committee has looked at seriously.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","I imagine we will be having discussions about it,",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","but—not something that we have on the calendar right now.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","that’s a—that’s a reasonable range,",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","of—it’s not that we’re all on the same number,",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","but there are a range of views about potential growth.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","And there’s so much uncertainty around this.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","we don’t—the thing about fiscal policy is,",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","you don’t have thousands of incidents to,",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","to—you don’t have But I think our approach is going to be to watch and see and hope that,",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","we do get significant effects to,",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","to potential growth out of the tax bill,",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","and we’re just going to have to see.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","I think we’re looking at a reasonable range of estimates and we’re putting every—different participants are putting different estimates in and we’re going to be waiting and seeing.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","what we’ve said in our Statement of Longer-Run Principles and Monetary Policy Strategy is that the Committee would be concerned if inflation were to run persistently above or below 2 percent,",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","persistently above or below 2 percent.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","And that’s what we mean by symmetric.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","We’re looking at it equally on either side and it’s a matter of persistent overruns.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","We know that inflation is going to bounce around.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","later this summer there’s a good chance that headline inflation will move up above we would be using our tools to try to move inflation back in the direction of the target.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","that we don’t have the ability to precisely hit that target,",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","so we expect that inflation will be above or below.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","And we just hope that that is—happens on a symmetric basis.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","I think what you should see is that the economy is continuing to make progress.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","The economy has strengthened so much since I joined the Fed, you know, in 2012 and even over the last couple of years.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","The economy is in a very different place.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","We— unemployment was 10 percent at the height of the crisis.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","It’s 3.8 percent now and moving lower.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","So really what you—the decision you see today is another sign that the",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","You know, wages have been gradually moving up.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","they were—there are many different wage measures,",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","but—so just—but just to generalize,",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","wages were running roughly around 2 percent and they’ve moved gradually up into between 2 to 3 percent as the labor market has become stronger and stronger.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","I think it’s fair to say that some of us—and I certainly would have expected wages to react more to the very significant reduction in unemployment that we’ve had,",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","from 10 percent to 3.8 percent.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","Part of that can be explained by low productivity,",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","which is something we’ve talked about at the Committee and elsewhere.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","and many people have anticipated,",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","that wages—that in a world where we’re hearing lots and lots about labor shortages—everywhere we go now,",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","we hear about labor shortages—but where is the wage reaction?",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","I wouldn’t say it’s a mystery, but it’s a bit of a puzzle.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","And, frankly, I do think there’s a lot to like about low unemployment.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","And one of the things is—you will see—pretty much people who want to get jobs—not everybody—but people who want to get jobs,",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","many of them will be able to get jobs.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","the margins of the labor force having an opportunity to get back in work.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","So there are a lot of things to really like,",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","to make sure that—that maximum employment happens in a context of price stability and financial stability,",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","which is why we’re gradually raising rates.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","You mentioned that unemployment moved down and inflation moved up by truly small amounts.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","If you look at the Summary of Economic Projections,",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","things are moving by just a tick or even a semitick between now and March.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","I think we take a longer-run view that we’re shooting for—we’re aiming for— 2 percent inflation—inflation around 2 percent.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","We know that it’ll be above or below.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","We’re not going to—we didn’t overreact, I think, to inflation being under 2 percent.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","We won’t overreact to it being over 2 percent.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","And I think we’ll always be using our tools to move inflation in the direction of the target,",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","if it—if it leaves—if it moves away from the target persistently,",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","you have to acknowledge that we are—no one really knows with certainty what the level of the natural rate of unemployment is,",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","the rate that is sustainable over a long period of time.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","And we know that probably that rate has declined as the",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","So I would say that—remember the important thing is that we want the federal funds rate to trade in the target range.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","That’s the whole, the whole idea.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","IOER is the principal tool by which we assure that that will happen.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","basic documents that we will adjust the use of our tools,",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","We don’t expect to have to do this often or again,",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","but we’re not sure about that.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","If we have to do it again, we’ll do it again.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","Again, don’t expect it to happen.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","we’re looking carefully at that and,",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","the truth is we don’t—we don’t know with any precision.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","It’s—you can’t run experiments, you know, with one effect and not the other.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","I think there’s a lot of probability on the idea of just high bill supply leads to higher repo costs,",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","higher money market rates generally,",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","and the arbitrage pulls up today.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","What we really need is to have the federal funds rate trade in the range,",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","and that’s what this minor technical adjustment accomplishes.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","do we think the natural rate of unemployment is lower?",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","So I think we do believe it has moved down significantly over a long period of time.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","We don’t think that the natural rate of unemployment— you know,",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","it’s not one of those variables that moves around a lot.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","It tends to be driven by slow- moving variables,",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","like the functioning of the labor market,",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","So, you know, it may—it may have moved down too, on a cyclical basis, lower.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","As the economy gets hotter and hotter, there’s some possibility of that.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","there have been a lot of studies done and,",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","real- time estimates of the natural rate of unemployment have uncertainty bands,",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","which are—which are quite wide,",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","so we have to remember that and very much be guided by the—by the incoming data.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","inflation we look about—we look at the 2 percent inflation objective as something that central banks,",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","And we have to be strongly committed to achieving that using our tools to do that.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","I think in—in recent years the dominant force has been,",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","disinflationary—have been pushing down on inflation.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","And important that inflation not fall below 2 percent,",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","that inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2 percent—very important—because the implications of inflation below 2 percent are that you’re closer to the zero lower bound,",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","meaning the Fed has less room to cut,",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","meaning that we’ll spend more time there and we won’t be able to do the job that we’re assigned to do for our citizens.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","I would just—would—I would just emphasize, emphasize that—a couple things.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","we’re learning about the real location of the natural rate of unemployment as we go.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","So it’s moved down by more than a full percentage point since 2012.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","So it’s not so simple as thinking,",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","we’ve just got to go ahead and get that rate up.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","If you—if you look at the forecast,",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","you’re still seeing inflation very close to target.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","So there’s no sense that inflation will—no sense in our models,",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","or forecasts—that inflation will take off or move unexpectedly quickly from these levels,",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","even if unemployment does remain low.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","So that’s—that’s what—so it’s important to know that the—the unemployment rate forecasts go with the inflation forecasts and go with the rate forecasts.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","And so each person who’s submitting them is submitting accommodate—you know,",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","appropriate monetary policy that fits with that person’s assessment.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","And their but that’s not what we think will happen.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","You know, the best estimate that we have, over the longer run, is that.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","Although, you know, there’s a range of views, you know.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","Some people are in the low 4s,",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","I said the uncertainty bands are,",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","not quite a full percentage point on either side,",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","you know—we can’t do—we can’t be too attached to these unobservable variables.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","we—I think we have to be practical about the way we think about these things and we do that by being grounded in the data and what we see happening in the real economy.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","So the countercyclical capital buffer gives us the ability to raise capital requirements on the largest institutions when financial stability vulnerabilities are meaningfully above normal.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","That’s the language that we’ve used.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","And that’s certainly a possibility.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","I wouldn’t say that—I wouldn't look at today’s financial stability landscape and say down their debt,",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","So households are not really a concern.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","And banks are highly capitalized, so that’s not really a concern.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","We see—there’s some concern with asset prices in a couple of pockets.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","Could that change, you asked, over a couple of years?",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","You also asked about marijuana businesses.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","So this is a very difficult area because we have state law—many state laws permit the use of marijuana and federal law still doesn’t.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","So it puts, you know, federally chartered banks in a very difficult situation.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","I think it would be great if that could be clarified.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","We don’t have—you know, it puts the supervisor in a very, very difficult position.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","this isn’t our—our mandate has nothing to do with marijuana,",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","so we don’t really—we just would love to see it clarified,",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","You know, I would say that the economy is in great shape.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","If you look at household surveys, confidence is high.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","Look at businesses, confidence is high.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","If you ask—if you survey workers about the job market,",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","they’ll say that it’s a really good doing is,",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","we are trying to conduct monetary policy in a way that will sustain that expansion,",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","keep the labor markets strong,",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","and keep inflation above—right at—sorry,",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","That’s really what we’re trying to do and,",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","I would say I like the results so far.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","We’re—we’ve been very, very careful not to tighten too quickly.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","I think that patience has borne fruit and I think it continues to.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","We had a lot of encouragement to go much faster and I’m really glad we didn’t.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","the— continuing on that gradual pace seems—continues to seem like the right thing.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","If we get a sense that the economy is reacting badly,",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","then we’ll certainly react to that.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","So I would just point you to the range of estimates at the Committee,",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","So that’s the range of estimates of the nominal neutral rate of interest.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","And we do understand that there’s high uncertainty around the level,",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","but that’s kind of—so you can think of 2.9 as being—which is sort of a full percentage point away from where fed funds is going to trade after today’s decision.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","You asked, is the—is the neutral rate moving up because of fiscal policy?",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","there’s—there should be an effect if you have increased deficits that should put upward pressure on,",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","Again, though, they were estimating these things.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","Well, I think you have to look at inflation.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","You’ve got to look at—you’ve got to look at all of the indicators in the economy and look at inflation,",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","look at what’s happening in the job market.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","And inflation is really important.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","It’s worth noting that the last two business cycles didn’t end with high inflation—they ended with financial instability—so that’s something we need to also keep our eye on.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","Yes, that is—that is something that we discuss.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","As you know, we made a—we made a significant number of changes at this meeting.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","So language gets in the statement and then, you know, the economy changes.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","We really—our approach to policy hasn’t changed.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","the economy has needed accommodative monetary policy.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","we’ve been gradually raising rates and we will—we will be at a place relatively soon when,",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","assuming we stay on this path,",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","when interest rates will be in the zone of what FOMC participants think is roughly neutral.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","it would no longer be accurate for us to say that the Committee thinks that policy is accommodative.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","We kind of don’t think it’s here yet, but it’s certainly coming.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","And I think that the market will understand that.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","I mean, the real message is that you’re getting close to the communicate about it.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","I’m really committed to staying in our lane on things.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","We have very important jobs assigned to us by Congress and that’s maximum employment,",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","Trade is explicitly assigned to the executive branch by Congress and not to us.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","So we don’t really—we don’t really seek to play a role in trade policy.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","Those are—those powers and decisions are given to others and so we want to stick to what we do.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","we do hear from our business contacts,",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","which are extensive in the United States,",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","and we do report on that in the minutes,",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","and I’ve just mentioned what those are.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","There is —there is concern that trade changes could be disruptive.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","And I also—as I also mentioned, we don’t see it in the numbers yet.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","We see a very strong economy across a bunch of fronts.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","It hasn’t reached everyone, let’s be clear on that.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","But most people who want a job can",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","So let me—let me briefly mention the yield curve.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","I— the yield curve is something that people are talking about a lot,",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","And I—you have a range of views.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","It’s something we’re going to continue to be talking about.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","It’s—but it’s only one of many things, of course, that we talk about.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","I think that that discussion is really about what is appropriate policy,",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","and how do we think about policy as we approach the neutral rate.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","How do we understand what the neutral rate is?",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","And what are the consequences of being above or below it?",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","That’s really what—when people are talking about the slope of the yield curve,",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","that’s really what they’re talking about.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","We know why—we know why the yield curve is flattening.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","It’s because we’re raising the federal funds rate.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","It makes all the sense in the world that the short end would come up.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","I think you asked—the harder question is, what’s happening with long rates?",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","And there are many things that move long rates around.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","Of course, there’s an embedded expectation of the path of short rates.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","There’s the term premium, which has been very low by historical standards.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","And so arguments are made that a flatter yield curve has less of a signal embedded in it.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","In 1 Chairman Powell intended to say that there are pockets of people in the United States who have not yet experienced the economic recovery.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","Treasury prices go up, rates go down quite a lot.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","what we’re—what we really care about is what’s the appropriate stance of policy.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","And there’s a— there may be a signal in that long-term rate about what is the neutral rate,",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","and I think that’s why people are paying attention to the yield curve.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","you do not see excess credit growth,",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","you don’t see high levels of credit going out.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","And that really was where the problems were before the financial crisis,",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","was particularly in—among household borrowing,",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","With—if you take banks, then, of course, their leverage is significantly lower.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","Or, to say it differently, their capital is significantly higher.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","If you ask about nonfinancial corporates,",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","that’s really where leverage is at levels that are high relative to history.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","so it’s something— that’s something we’re watching very carefully.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","I don’t think we see it as—I think there are a range of views on that,",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","but we are watching nonfinancial corporates.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","and that is—that is so important because that’s where—you know,",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","that’s where we got into trouble before.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","And that’s—it’s often around property, and particularly housing, where you see real problems emerge.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","We don’t really see that now, so we take some solace from that.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","And I’m wondering if you or the Committee has thought about your move to raise interest rates as partly responding to the economy,",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","but partly giving yourselves room to navigate in the inevitable future recession,",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","And do you think that that has played any part in,",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","your outlook for policy or recent policy decisions?",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","Or is it, you know, just a purely based on what the economy is doing?",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","So it doesn’t play any part in my thinking and I’ll tell you why.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","If you raise rates too quickly,",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","you’re just increasing the likelihood of a recession,",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","and that’s exactly what you don’t want to do.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","I think—I think the incentives actually run in the other direction.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","If you’re—if you’re worried about going back to the lower bound,",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","then risk management would suggest that you go a little slower in raising rates and tolerate—that’s likely to be a more sustainable strategy to get further away from the zero lower bound.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","I think we’re far enough away now, though, that the risks are kind of balanced.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","And so I think it’s more just—we’re just looking at the economy,",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","and how do we— how do we sustain the expansion,",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","and try to keep inflation near 2 percent?",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","You know, we don’t—we don’t have the tools to control that.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","If companies choose to—companies in our system are free to do what they can—what they need pay their workers.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","You know, the part—and, you know, we don’t play a role in those decisions.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","The part that we focus on is maximum employment.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","So we view maximum employment as the maximum sustainable level of employment,",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","meaning it’s not so much that it will cause the economy to overheat.",""
"2018-06-13","Q&A","And so I think we’ve been committed to that.",""

"2018-09-26","Opening Statement","Growth is running at a healthy clip.",""
"2018-09-26","Opening Statement","Unemployment is low, the number of people working is rising steadily, and wages are up.",""

"2018-09-26","Opening Statement","The benefits of this strong economy have not reached all Americans.",""
"2018-09-26","Opening Statement","Many of our country’s economic challenges are beyond the scope of the Fed,",""

"2018-09-26","Opening Statement","That is the best way we can promote an environment in which every American has the opportunity to succeed.",""
"2018-09-26","Opening Statement","Each time my colleagues and I meet,",""
"2018-09-26","Opening Statement","How can we set policy to best support job growth and low,",""
"2018-09-26","Opening Statement","this question called for very low interest rates to help an economy that had been damaged by the deep financial crisis that gripped the world 10 years ago.",""
"2018-09-26","Opening Statement","As the economy has steadily gained strength,",""
"2018-09-26","Opening Statement","the Fed has been gradually returning interest rates closer to levels that are normal in a healthy economy.",""
"2018-09-26","Opening Statement","We took another step on that path today with a quarter-point increase in short-term interest rates.",""
"2018-09-26","Opening Statement","and my colleagues and I believe that this gradual return to normal is helping to sustain this strong economy for the longer-run benefit of all Americans.",""
"2018-09-26","Opening Statement","10 years have now passed since the depths of the financial crisis—a painful part of our history that cost many Americans their jobs,",""
"2018-09-26","Opening Statement","In addition to holding interest rates low to support the recovery,",""
"2018-09-26","Opening Statement","we have also taken many steps to make the financial system safer.",""
"2018-09-26","Opening Statement","we’re holding the largest in a far better position to support the financial needs of households and businesses through good times and bad.",""
"2018-09-26","Opening Statement","We continue to work to sustain these fundamental improvements while also ensuring that regulation is both effective and efficient.",""
"2018-09-26","Opening Statement","Now, let me go into more detail about the developments that motivated today’s policy decision.",""
"2018-09-26","Opening Statement","Both household spending and business investment are expanding briskly,",""
"2018-09-26","Opening Statement","and the overall growth outlook remains favorable.",""
"2018-09-26","Opening Statement","And several factors support this assessment:",""
"2018-09-26","Opening Statement","Fiscal policy is boosting the economy,",""
"2018-09-26","Opening Statement","ongoing job gains are raising incomes and confidence,",""
"2018-09-26","Opening Statement","and overall financial conditions remain accommodative.",""
"2018-09-26","Opening Statement","These conditions are consistent with our Summary of Economic Projections for this meeting.",""
"2018-09-26","Opening Statement","The median of Committee participants’ projections for the growth of real GDP is 3.1 percent this year and 2.5 percent next year.",""
"2018-09-26","Opening Statement","Job gains averaged 185,000 per month over the last three months,",""
"2018-09-26","Opening Statement","well above the pace needed in the longer run to provide jobs for new entrants to the labor force.",""
"2018-09-26","Opening Statement","The unemployment rate stood at 3.9 percent in August and has been near that level since April.",""
"2018-09-26","Opening Statement","the labor force participation rate remains about where it was in late 2013—a positive sign,",""
"2018-09-26","Opening Statement","given that the aging of our population is putting downward pressure on participation.",""
"2018-09-26","Opening Statement","We expect the job market to remain strong.",""
"2018-09-26","Opening Statement","And the median of Committee participants’ projections for the unemployment rate later this year is 3.7 percent and a bit lower than that in 2019.",""
"2018-09-26","Opening Statement","as measured by the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE inflation),",""
"2018-09-26","Opening Statement","increased 2.3 percent over the 12 months ending in July.",""
"2018-09-26","Opening Statement","which excludes the prices of energy and food and tends to be a better indicator of time,",""
"2018-09-26","Opening Statement","inflation may be somewhat above or below 2 percent.",""
"2018-09-26","Opening Statement","the recent rise in oil prices has pushed inflation a little above 2 percent,",""
"2018-09-26","Opening Statement","but we expect this to be transitory,",""
"2018-09-26","Opening Statement","as is reflected in our projections.",""
"2018-09-26","Opening Statement","The median projections for both the overall and core inflation measures remain very close to 2 percent across the whole projection horizon.",""
"2018-09-26","Opening Statement","Today the Committee raised the target range for the federal funds rate by ¼ percentage point,",""
"2018-09-26","Opening Statement","bringing it to 2 to 2¼ percent.",""
"2018-09-26","Opening Statement","This action reflects the strength we see in the economy and is one more step in the process that we began almost three years ago of gradually returning interest rates to more normal levels.",""
"2018-09-26","Opening Statement","Looking ahead, today’s projections show gradual interest rate increases continuing roughly as foreseen in June.",""
"2018-09-26","Opening Statement","The median of participants’ views on appropriate policy through 2020 are unchanged since the June meeting.",""
"2018-09-26","Opening Statement","These projections play an important role in our work.",""
"2018-09-26","Opening Statement","My colleagues and I believe that it’s useful to communicate our views on likely prospects for the economy and for policy.",""
"2018-09-26","Opening Statement","that the economy regularly surprises,",""
"2018-09-26","Opening Statement","and that even the most carefully constructed projections are highly uncertain.",""
"2018-09-26","Opening Statement","The projections about the appropriate path of policy assume that the economy evolves broadly in line with the projections for growth,",""
"2018-09-26","Opening Statement","If the economy were instead to falter, lower interest rates would be appropriate.",""
"2018-09-26","Opening Statement","if inflationary pressures were to rise more than expected,",""
"2018-09-26","Opening Statement","higher interest rates would be appropriate.",""
"2018-09-26","Opening Statement","Right now, as our statement indicates, risks to the economic outlook appear roughly balanced.",""
"2018-09-26","Opening Statement","Readers of the FOMC statement likely noted that the Committee dropped a sentence that indicated that “the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative.” This change does not target range for the federal funds rate,” and this expectation is reflected in the projections that I just discussed.",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","is a reflection of the strength of the economy.",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","And it’s almost three years now that we’ve been gradually raising rates.",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","And I think the fact that we have moved quite gradually,",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","allows us to carefully watch incoming data in the real economy and in the financial markets to see how the economy is processing higher interest rates.",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","And the fact that we’re moving so gradually—I think it—I think it limits the long and variable lags problem because,",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","we’re being able to raise rates and then wait and see how the economy absorbs these rate increases.",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","the economy has performed very well and very much in keeping with our expectations.",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","So we’ve been given a really important job to do on behalf of the American people by Congress,",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","and we’ve been given the tools to do it,",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","and my colleagues extensively and come to a perspective and try to set monetary policy to achieve maximum employment in a context of price stability.",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","We don’t consider political factors or things like that.",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","And so that’s who we are, that’s what we do, and that’s just the way it’s always going to be for us.",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","So in terms of financial markets and monetary policy,",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","we—as we say in our statement every cycle,",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","we do take financial conditions into consideration because financial—broader financial conditions do affect the broader economy,",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","and they’re one of the many things that we take into account.",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","The part of it that we control,",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","is what we do with the federal funds rate and that has—that has effects out through,",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","out through the full interest rate curve and into financial asset prices generally.",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","we take everything into account,",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","broader financial conditions are just one of the things that we take into account.",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","why—your question was why the funds rate needs to be above neutral?",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","Some of—some of the participants have mostly very modest going to be.",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","What we’re going to be doing as we—as we go through time is asking at every meeting whether monetary policy is set to achieve our goals.",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","And I think that that’s an assessment of where policy will need to be some years down the road,",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","The Committee forecasts what they—what they show,",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","is an economy where unemployment remains in the high and middle 3s throughout the entire forecast period and inflation remains very close to 2 percent.",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","That is what the forecast shows.",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","And that is based on our understanding of the way the inflation process works now and on the fact that the inflation seems to be fairly nonreactive to changes in slack— that is to say,",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","And it’s just—it’s a—it’s a world of strongly anchored inflation expectations.",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","And that’s not just our forecast, that’s many forecasts.",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","So that is—that is —that is the forecast.",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","what does the longer-run natural rate of unemployment mean?",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","And so that really is a longer-run concept that we think the economy will return to over the longer run.",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","isn’t— it’s not creating problems in the short run for that forecast.",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","If inflation reacts more strongly or more weakly to the strong economy,",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","then we’ll adjust policy appropriately.",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","have effects—I mean if—I guess the—your question was,",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","what are you buying with by raising interest rates?",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","The question is, what would the economy look like if you didn’t raise rates?",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","It would look very different, I think, if we didn’t raise rates.",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","work our way between the—sort of the two—the two problems we face.",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","One is that if we move too quickly,",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","snuff out a recovery unnecessarily,",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","and inflation falls short of its 2 percent target.",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","Or if we move too slowly, we have an economy that can overheat.",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","So we’re—that—that’s happened through history.",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","We don’t see any signs of that now,",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","but we’re always trying to navigate between those two shoals.",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","raising interest rates is the way that we kind of take both of those risks seriously.",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","As I said, I think I’m in the camp of seeing vulnerabilities as relatively moderate.",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","I think the financial system—I think another thing that we learned in the crisis is that we need to be alert to the buildup of vulnerabilities as a long expansion continues.",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","I don’t see that in troubling—troubling amounts at this point, but, you know, I think it’s appropriate for us to monitor that very carefully.",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","So I guess I need to start by saying that we’re not responsible for trade policy,",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","and we don’t comment on particular,",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","trade actions and that sort of thing.",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","But you will have seen that we have this very extensive network of business contacts around the country through the Reserve Banks largely,",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","and we’ve been hearing a rising chorus of concerns from businesses all over the country about disruption of supply chains,",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","So we’ve been hearing quite a lot of that,",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","and we—the Reserve Bank presidents talk about it in the meeting,",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","So we, you know, that’s—we’re very transparent about hearing all that.",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","I think if you look at the aggregate perform—the performance of the",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","This year has—we’ve kept raising our forecast for this year.",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","the economy has come in stronger than we expected,",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","and that’s a really good thing.",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","as I mentioned at the beginning,",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","and there’s good reason to expect that to continue.",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","the effect of the fiscal policy changes,",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","and the spending increases—that’s got to be part of the story.",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","Part of it may be higher oil prices,",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","which are calling for more investment in the bright moment,",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","If you look back over the last decade,",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","this is a pretty good moment for the",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","So, you know, we hope they’re huge, frankly.",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","you cut—you reduce taxation on corporations and particularly—and allow faster expensing for investment.",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","The idea is to encourage more investment,",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","and that is one of the things that drives productivity,",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","which is one of the main things that drives rising incomes.",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","So the effects are very uncertain,",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","they’re—the literature is—it’s—there’s no clear answer to exactly how these mechanisms work or how effective they are.",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","And it would be soon to be seeing supply-side effects.",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","The other—supply- side effects are probably both more uncertain and they’re probably slower to come in.",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","we—I certainly hope—I hope that we’ll be marking up our estimates of potential growth as well.",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","You mean—you mean, where’s the point at which inflation— unemployment is too low?",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","so we’ve been—I think the perform—labor fourth quarter of ’13 till now,",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","you really have a—kind of an oscillation that basically is a sideways movement in the face of a significant downward trend,",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","thanks to aging and other factors.",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","That’s a gain of well more than a percentage point in participation,",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","so that’s really— that’s really a good thing.",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","Those are people who are remaining in contact with the labor force and looking for jobs,",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","And, by the way, it’s a signal.",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","It’s one of the things that has allowed the unemployment rate not to fall further.",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","that there may be more there on the supply side,",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","that there may be more labor supply than the prior trend would indicate.",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","So it’s a very positive thing to see people staying in the labor force.",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","And, you know, we don’t know how long it can continue.",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","We have models, and we look at this—we look at this question all the time.",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","we’ve been surprised on the positive side here,",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","so we’re open to the idea that that may continue or not.",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","You know, so you could see prices moving up.",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","You don’t see it yet, but we—you could see retail prices moving up.",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","The tariffs shop on the internet.",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","This could provide, you know, a way for—again, we don’t see it in the numbers.",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","until we see it in the numbers,",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","it’s hard to say how one would react.",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","And the other question would be,",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","if you’re just talking about the effect on inflation is,",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","is it just a one-time increase in the price level,",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","or is it actually fueling higher inflation going forward?",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","And that’s a real—that’s an important question in,",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","in how we would think about the appropriate response.",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","You know, don’t see it yet, but we—you’re hearing—I mean, broadly across the economy, it’s not just tariffs.",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","You’re hearing—we’re hearing a lot of talk of labor shortages, of material costs in particular industries.",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","We’re hearing a lot, you know, what amount to supply-side constraints and things like that, but we’re not seeing it.",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","We’re seeing a sort of modest increase in wages, inflation right around 2 percent, no sense of it moving up really, so we’re not seeing it yet.",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","And, you know, we just aren’t, and we’re watching very carefully.",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","So the dot plot—I mean, I—it’s not new.",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","I don’t think it’s a new point that forecasts two and three out—two or three years out are fairly uncertain.",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","The dot plot is individual FOMC participants who are writing down their individual views on the evolution of the economy and of appropriate monetary policy.",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","I think market participants generally find that interesting information,",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","and so it seems to me to be serving a purpose.",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","I think the point with “accommodative” was that its useful life was over.",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","we put that in the statement in 2015,",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","and the idea was to provide assurance that we weren’t trying to slow down the economy,",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","we were still—interest rates were still going to be pushing to support economic activity.",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","that purpose has been well served,",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","and the language now doesn’t really say anything that’s important to the way the Committee is thinking about policy going forward.",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","Did I get— did I get all of your ques—?",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","Yeah, you know, it’s—if you look at a broad financial conditions index, that’s pretty much the answer you’ll get.",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","We don’t control that, and, as I mentioned earlier, we do take financial conditions into account in what we do.",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","And financial conditions are affecting the broader economy, so, by definition, we’re taking them into account.",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","But if you look at—look at interest rates, you know, interest rates—look at long-term interest rates this year and short-term interest rates this year, there’s very significant increases.",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","so in terms of nominations to the Fed,",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","completely under the control of the White House and,",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","the Fed Chair has been consulted on those,",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","and I’m happy to say that that has continued.",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","But these are—these are really decisions for the White House,",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","we are—think of us as just being consulted.",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","I will say that I’m very happy and excited about the team that we’re putting together,",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","and I’m very much looking forward to having those offices up and down our hall filled.",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","which is saying something on the Board hall.",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","So we’re looking forward to getting some people confirmed.",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","so this is a—this is a—you know,",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","I was an investor for a long time in areas that were very close to the leveraged lending markets.",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","So, you know, I have had a lot of experience in that.",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","That market has evolved really significantly since before the crisis.",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","And, you know, the banks take much less risk than they used to.",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","They’re—the—they’re this—that excessive risk-taking in the leveraged lending markets does have channels for affecting the real economy,",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","if there’s overheating and that kind of thing in those markets,",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","that the leveraged lending isn’t binding,",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","and that’s just—that’s just the way that the law is interpreted.",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","So it’s something we’re monitoring, and, as I mentioned, we think overall vulnerabilities are moderate.",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","Okay, so are we accommodative now?",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","So I think if you look at the—look at the dot plot in the SEP,",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","you’ll see that the federal funds rate,",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","is below the longer-run neutral estimate of every single participant that—who submits a— an estimate of that.",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","So that’s why this is the perfect time to take the language out,",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","it’s perfectly clear that there can’t be a signal because,",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","that means an accommodative policy.",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","So it wasn’t because policy is not accommodative.",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","it’s more that the language has run its useful life.",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","we don’t want to suggest either that we have this precise understanding of where “accommodative” stops or suggest that that’s a really important point in our thinking.",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","assuming we we want to achieve—you know,",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","That’s the way we’re thinking about it,",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","and that does kind of amount to thinking less about one’s precise point estimate of the neutral rate.",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","So that’s how I think about that.",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","many of the participants have written that down,",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","and they’ve written down really modest overshoots,",""

"2018-09-26","Q&A","which wouldn’t have a big effect on the economy.",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","You know, it—I would just say, you know, it really depends on what happens.",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","It depends on if we keep going—you can think of it different ways.",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","Maybe we’ve underestimated the neutral rate.",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","Maybe we’ll be raising our estimate of the neutral rate and we’ll just go to that,",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","or maybe we’ll keep our neutral rate here and then go one or two rate increases beyond it.",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","I think it’s very possible, but I mean, ultimately, isn’t really the question we’re answering.",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","The question we’re answering is,",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","how do we provide the economy just the right amount of support— not too much,",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","not too little—to sustain the recovery and achieve our statutory goals?",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","The first thing is the single biggest thing I think that we learned was the—as I mentioned,",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","the importance of maintaining the stability of the financial system.",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","So I think if you look—if you look back at the way the models worked and the way people thought about risk in the economy,",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","and I think it’s not missing anymore.",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","So we—you know, we put a tremendous focus on that.",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","which force banks to understand—the largest banks particularly—to understand and better manage their risk and have enough capital to survive a really substantial shock that’s at least as bad as the financial crisis.",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","have made really substantial progress,",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","more than I had thought was likely.",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","Nobody’s—you know, nobody is, I think, overconfident that we’ve solved every problem.",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","now we’re going back and kind of taking a hard look at everything and,",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","trying to make—trying to—trying to keep at it.",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","So I think those are the really important lessons,",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","And that’s, I think, a risk now—is to—is to forget things that we—that we learned.",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","That’s just human nature over time.",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","I saw the article you’re talking about;",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","did Congress take things away,",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","emergency powers from the Fed?",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","So there was sort of a trade for taking away our power under authority.",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","I don’t think there’s any sense that Congress would seriously look at changing that.",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","I have real doubts about whether it was wise to take away our crisis-fighting tools.",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","and you hope you never need them,",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","but—and I certainly strongly oppose efforts to take away more of our tools.",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","You know, the third thing you mentioned is the designation power.",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","So it’s a really important power.",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","it should be used—my thinking,",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","in situations where you have—I mean,",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","you could have another Lehman Brothers come up out of the ground that’s not a bank,",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","and it could be very threatening—or it could be capable of creating systemic risk.",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","And so I think it’s a critical power to have.",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","But, again, I would use it—I would tend to use it fairly sparingly.",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","Yeah, we look—of course, we look at that very carefully, and interest rates are going up across a broad range of consumer borrowing, as they would when we raise short-term interest rates.",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","They’re still quite low by historical levels.",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","And the other thing I’ll say is, take—if you take housing, if you look at the NAR Affordability Index, housing is still more affordable now than it was before the financial crisis.",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","So you’re right that the cost of borrowing is going up, but it’s going up from what were extraordinarily low levels, and it is",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","Well, at the Fed, we are, you know, deeply committed to the mission of CRA, which is for banks to provide credit and other banking services in the communities they serve.",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","And we have also been of the view for some time that with the evolution of technology particularly and changes—changes in the nature of banking,",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","that it’s an appropriate time—it’s past an appropriate time,",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","but now it’s certainly an appropriate time to revisit the way we think about",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","some of the things that we’d be looking at to tell us whether we’re getting close to supply-side limits would be,",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","A slowing down in job growth would be an indicator, you know.",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","An unexpectedly sharp increase in wages or inflation could tell you that you’re reaching those points.",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","You know, if headline growth slowed down, that’s another one.",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","So all of those things would be worth taking into consideration.",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","we’ve seen sometimes sharp tightening in financial conditions,",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","as we saw at the beginning of 2016,",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","can have a substantial effect pretty quickly on our economy if it’s a broad and significant tightening.",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","So we would be looking for those kinds of things and many other things.",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","So, in terms of divergence, yes.",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","So we’ve said that we would use our tools to assure that the federal funds rate trains—trades within the target range.",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","And the principal tools we use have been interest on excess reserves and then,",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","we only raised the interest on excess reserves by 20 basis points and raised the range by 25,",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","and that moved federal funds sort of back into the range.",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","It worked, and it was successful.",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","The federal funds rate traded in the low 190s, well within the range.",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","You know, we—again, we have our tools, and we will use them.",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","We think it’s principally a function just of a number of things,",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","but particularly high Treasury supply,",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","and—which is showing up in repo rates and then showing up in fed funds as well.",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","So we don’t see it as a—as a big problem.",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","We see it as a problem we can address with our tools,",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","and we’ll use them if we have to.",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","And we do—we do monetary policy.",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","We regulate financial institutions, financial stability, that sort of thing.",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","We don’t have responsibility for fiscal policy.",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","fiscal policy will have a significant effect on the economy,",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","I think my predecessors have commented on fiscal policy.",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","But they’ve commented on—at a high level rather than trying to get involved in particular,",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","And so—and I—my plan is to kind of stick to the same approach and stay in our lane.",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","it’s been true for a long time that with our uniquely expensive health-care delivery system and the aging of our population,",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","we’ve been on an unsustainable fiscal path for a long time,",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","and there’s no hiding from it.",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","And also, these are good times.",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","this is—this is the economy at nearly full employment or in the range—in the neighborhood of full employment.",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","It’s a—it’s a good time to be addressing these things.",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","So I just—I put that out there and leave it at that.",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","Well, we serve a domestic mandate, which is assigned to us by Congress, and that is to have maximum employment and stable prices.",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","About half of global GDP is outside the United States, and way more than half of the growth is outside the United States and in emerging markets, I should say.",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","And so the performance in the emerging market economies really, really matters to us in carrying out our domestic mandate.",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","I’d also say that, you know, a strong",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","So I don’t comment on the appropriateness of the level of stock prices.",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","I can say that by some valuation measures,",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","they’re in the upper range of their historical value ranges.",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","I wouldn’t want to—I wouldn’t want to speculate about what the consequences of a market correction should be.",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","we would—we would look very carefully at the nature of it,",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","it—really—really what hurts is if consumers are borrowing heavily and doing so against,",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","an asset that can fall in value.",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","So that’s a really serious matter when you have a housing bubble and highly levered consumers and housing values fall.",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","And we know that that’s a really bad situation.",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","A simple drop in equity prices is— all by itself, doesn’t really have those features.",""
"2018-09-26","Q&A","It could certainly feature—it could certainly affect consumption and have a negative effect on the economy,",""
"2018-12-19","Opening Statement","Thanks very much for being here today.",""
"2018-12-19","Opening Statement","Over the past year the economy has been growing at a strong pace, the unemployment rate has been near record lows, and inflation has been low and stable.",""
"2018-12-19","Opening Statement","All of those things remain true today.",""
"2018-12-19","Opening Statement","Since the September meeting of the FOMC, however, some crosscurrents have emerged.",""
"2018-12-19","Opening Statement","I’ll explain how my colleagues and I are incorporating those crosscurrents into our judgments about the outlook and the appropriate course of policy.",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","Inflation has come in just a touch below where we expected it to be—not by a big amount, but by a small amount.",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","More broadly, 2018 has been the strongest year since the recov—since the financial crisis.",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","And during that period we’ve had low unemployment and strong growth, and inflation has still remained just a ultimate destination of any further rate increases.",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","I think we—people who were working at the Fed in 2013 and ’14 took away the lesson that the markets could be very sensitive to news about the size of the balance sheet,",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","So we thought carefully about this,",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","and came to the view that we would effectively have the balance sheet runoff on automatic pilot and use monetary policy,",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","And I think that has been a good decision.",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","I think that the runoff of the balance sheet has been smooth and has served its purpose.",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","And I don’t see us changing that.",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","And I do think that we will continue to use monetary policy,",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","as the active tool of monetary policy.",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","we monitor a broad range of economic conditions,",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","including financial conditions—a broad range of financial conditions.",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","And we took on board the tightening in financial conditions,",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","financial conditions have tightened since the September meeting,",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","So we took that on board in our forecast.",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","That’s why the forecast for growth and inflation went down a little statement language,",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","we acknowledged those risks in the clause about monitoring developments.",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","And we’re going to be watching carefully to see as those things develop.",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","there’s been a sense of concern among business people and market people about global growth,",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","that may be partly about trade tensions,",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","it may be partly about a variety of things.",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","If you just mechanically drop into a model of the",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","So, again, I go back to the health of the economy.",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","this the best year since the financial crisis.",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","You’ve had growth well above trend.",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","You’ve got inflation moving up to 2 percent.",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","And we also have a positive forecast,",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","we think this move was appropriate for what is a very healthy economy.",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","Policy at this point does not need to be accommodative.",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","It seems appropriate that it be neutral.",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","We’re now at the bottom end of the range of estimates of neutral.",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","So that’s the basis upon which we made the decision.",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","I also think we took on board,",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","we’re certainly cognizant of them.",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","Could you talk a little bit about what you expect to get from that panel,",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","and will the dot plot be involved in that at all?",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","How do you think the dot plot is working?",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","Are we dealing with it the way that you want us to be handling the dot plot,",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","or is it something that you might tweak a bit?",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","what it really is—it’s coming at a time when the economy is strong,",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","and it’s a good time to take a step back,",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","and ask whether our strategy and our tools and our communications around monetary policy are doing the job that Congress has assigned us to do on behalf of the American people.",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","And what we’re going to do is,",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","we’re going to open ourselves up and have a discussion with many outside groups of all different parts of the economy,",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","an academic conference in June in Chicago.",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","old ideas—many of them have been around—and try to assess whether there are better ways we can do things.",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","One of the overarching facts is that rates have been really coming down overall for more than three decades now.",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","We may be in a world where interest rates are just lower for the time being,",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","we’ll have less policy space to react to economic downturns.",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","And we’d want to be evaluating ideas for—again,",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","for better achieving the goals that Congress has given us.",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","We’re not looking at law changes at all,",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","and we’re not looking at changing the inflation target,",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","We are looking for better ways to achieve the inflation goal—for example,",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","As I mentioned, on the dot plot—you asked about the dot plot.",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","I think the dot plot generally does provide useful information about the reaction function of Committee participants—sometimes more useful than others,",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","But, in general, I think people sort on.",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","It’s something that each of us writes down,",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","and we always update it as—you know,",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","as data come in and as we update our outlooks.",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","but the amount of—the amount of runoff that we’ve had so far is pretty small.",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","And if you just run the quantitative easing models in reverse,",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","you would get a pretty small adjustment in economic growth and real outcomes.",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","things that are happening at the short run—at the short end—are driven by many other factors other than the balance sheet runoff.",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","just—very large bill supply has pushed up short-term rates,",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","Tightening of the federal funds rate has raised short-term borrowing costs.",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","So, you know, we’re alert to these issues.",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","But we don’t see, you know, the balance sheet runoff as creating significant problems.",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","You know, we’re watching—we have a strong forecast, generally, for next year.",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","That forecast involves growth, you know, between 2 and 2½ percent.",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","It involves growth at a strong enough level to continue driving unemployment down and inflation near 2 percent.",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","So that’s a pretty positive forecast.",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","I’ll be looking for data that suggests that that’s,",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","I think it’s appropriate to be putting aside individual estimates of that and be looking at what the incoming data are telling you about the outlook,",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","updating your estimates of what neutral might be,",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","of what the natural rate of unemployment might be,",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","so—and letting that lead you to adjust your outlook and,",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","your appropriate path for policy.",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","So that’s what we mean when we say we’re “data dependent.” Of course,",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","but I think it has a particular meaning in this context,",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","Does it currently need to be restrictive?",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","And I don’t believe that it is.",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","I don’t believe that policy is restrictive.",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","Yeah, I—I’ve discussed this a couple of times.",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","And I guess I would just go back to this:",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","The individual forecasts are not something that the Committee votes on.",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","and we write down our—you know,",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","So people have disparate views on what the endpoint could be.",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","Ultimately, it’s going to depend on what the circumstances are.",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","There would be circumstances in which it would be appropriate to go past neutral,",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","and there would be circumstances in which it would be wholly inappropriate to do so.",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","So I don’t—I wouldn’t put too much on—it does inform you,",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","the way people are thinking about things.",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","But don’t—I wouldn’t take it as a signal about current policy or about near-term policy.",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","we get the Tealbook in person from the Reserve Bank presidents who come in,",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","and they share their discussions not just with their directors,",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","but with literally hundreds of business and nonprofit,",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","and labor union people around the country.1 And I personally find it really 1 Chairman Powell was referring to the Beige Book,",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","what—what you’re picking up now,",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","or it’s a mood of angst about growth going forward,",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","if I could just capture it in one thought.",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","There are many reasons that are given for that,",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","is growth going to be as strong as it was?",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","What might it be—to different people?",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","That doesn’t mean that it’ll come into the real data in a big way—it may,",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","but—or that financial conditions will tighten further.",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","For now, financial conditions have tightened a little bit.",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","We’ve taken that on board both in the outcomes,",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","but also in a lower rate path to—you know,",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","to provide some accommodation to push back against that tightening.",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","You know, financial conditions—broadly speaking, we don’t look at any one market.",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","We look at a really big range of financial conditions.",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","And what matters for the broader economy is material changes in a broad range of financial conditions that are sustained for a period of time.",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","A little bit of volatility—speaking in the abstract—some volatility doesn’t probably leave a mark on the economy.",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","And, you know, what we’ve seen here is a tightening.",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","There’s been a tightening since right around after—a week or so after the September meeting.",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","that—we tried to factor that into our models of the economy and to the results that come out of those models.",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","and it really matters if changes are sustained over time.",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","Well, I think we look at both, but core PCE is a good indicator.",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","50 years is that inflation has become much less reactive to changes in growth.",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","There was a time when inflation reacted really quickly to changes in growth and changes in unemployment,",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","And that is often attributed to the success of central banks in anchoring inflation expectations so that people believe that inflation will come back to the target or around the target so it doesn’t go down as much—inflation doesn’t go down as much in a downturn and doesn’t go up as much when the—you know,",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","that inflation has not reacted a lot on a road from 10 percent unemployment to now 3.7 percent unemployment.",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","Now, it did move up last year.",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","But in terms of just targeting growth,",""

"2018-12-19","Q&A","But I think that approach has served us well,",""

"2018-12-19","Q&A","I think having regular press conferences will be a big gain for communication.",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","being able to come out after each meeting and explain the Committee’s thinking and relate that to the state of the economy and expectations for policy and global developments,",""

"2018-12-19","Q&A","I do believe it will be a positive development.",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","I think it’ll also become the case,",""

"2018-12-19","Q&A","I mean, I think that’s probably pretty straightforward.",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","If we, you know—if we’re—if we want to communicate something about something that’s going to happen in a future meeting, I think we know how to do that in speeches, in press conferences, and such.",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","So what we’ve seen is, is a very gradual—and, I think, ongoing—increase in wages.",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","you’ll see that we look at many,",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","many indicators of wages and compensation.",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","But there are four principal ones.",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","And they were all kind of clustered around 2—if you go back five years ago—2 percent increase per year.",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","and they’ve just continued to gradually move up—not perfectly in sync,",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","but—and that’s a number that is,",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","right in keeping with 2 percent inflation and 1 percent productivity growth.",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","So in an economic sense, it makes sense.",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","and I think many forecasters expect,",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","that wage increases will continue,",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","and that would be a welcome development.",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","Wage—wage increases do not need to be inflationary.",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","There’s plenty of evidence of situations—for example,",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","in the very tight labor market of the late 1990s of a—I think I mentioned in a speech a month or so ago,",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","we had wage increases above productivity plus inflation,",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","and we didn’t have high inflation.",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","We hear a great deal of anecdotal information about labor shortages,",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","So I would expect that wages will keep moving up,",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","and it doesn’t necessarily mean inflation.",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","We don’t think of it that way.",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","So did that answer your question?",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","by most indicators—we look at a very wide range of indicators on the labor market.",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","And, by most indicators, we are at or even above longer-run normal levels.",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","But I would point to one particular pocket,",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","labor force participation by younger prime-age workers,",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","can we go above that cyclical peak?",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","or are the problems more structural than cyclical,",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","and that there isn’t—so we’ll have to find that out.",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","we’ve had the luxury of finding out that labor force participation can be higher than we had thought.",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","And that’s nothing but a good thing.",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","So you’re right that a big focus of what we have been doing has been tailoring regulations.",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","And the sense of “tailoring” is that we want to look below the level of the G-SIBs at the large regionals and then on down to the community banks at various steps and ask whether we have appropriately tailored regulation and supervision to account for the fact that smaller and less complex organizations present a much less significant threat to the economy and to the community should they fail—should they experience material difficulty.",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","So, in the nature of that, you’re focused more on the smaller institutions.",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","That’s something we’re working on.",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","You know, we—we think that things need to be looked at carefully.",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","I wouldn’t want to materially change capital levels,",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","it’s important that the largest financial institutions,",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","the largest and most complex—the systemically important ones be held to the highest standards and higher expectations.",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","And while we may tailor some regulations,",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","those fundamentally high expectations are not going to change.",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","we do focus on a broad range of financial indicators,",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","we don’t obsess about any particular one.",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","we look at a whole range of them,",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","what’s really going on in the broad picture out there?",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","if you ask what’s going on with the long—certainly the long,",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","longer-maturity Treasury market has come in some.",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","That’s consistent with, you know, a risk-off feeling in the stock market as well.",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","And, you know, we don’t know whether that’ll persist.",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","the longer Treasury has moved in a range above 3 percent and down 3 percent as the risk sentiment has changed.",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","I think if rates were to stay low for a longer period of time,",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","that could be thought of as a signal of expectations of lower growth.",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","But, you know, we don’t know that that’ll happen.",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","You know, monetary policy is a forward-looking exercise, and I’m going to—I’m just going to stick with that.",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","It’s—where we are right now is, we’re at the lower end of the range of neutral.",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","We’ve arrived effectively at the bottom end of that range.",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","And, you know, there are implications of that.",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","For that, as I mentioned, going forward, there’s real uncertainty about the path—the pace, rather, and the destination for further rate increases.",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","And we’re going to be letting incoming data inform our thinking about the appropriate path.",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","More broadly, I’m referring to global growth.",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","2017 was a year of kind of ongoing upside surprises in global growth.",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","It was the year of synchronized global growth.",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","And people raised their forecasts for growth around the world kind of throughout 2017 and,",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","expected that to continue into 2018.",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","What has happened instead has been a modest retracing of that.",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","So you have still healthy levels of growth in the aggregate around the world but close to the potential growth rate of,",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","like the negotiations between Italy and the EU over their budget.",""
"2018-12-19","Q&A","And, you know, as far as those are concerned, we monitor them very carefully.",""

"2019-01-30","Full Text","and also the effects and ultimate disposition of the shutdown.",""
"2019-01-30","Full Text","So we looked at—we look at those,",""
"2019-01-30","Full Text","and the way we think of it is that policy—we will use our policy,",""
"2019-01-30","Full Text","to offset risks to the baseline.",""
"2019-01-30","Full Text","So we view the baseline as still solid,",""
"2019-01-30","Full Text","and part of that is the way we adjusted our baseline to address those risks.",""
"2019-01-30","Full Text","So that’s the way we’re thinking about that now.",""
"2019-01-30","Full Text","we think the outlook is favorable,",""
"2019-01-30","Full Text","and we think that these crosscurrents that I referred to—these risks—are going to be with us for a while.",""
"2019-01-30","Full Text","We think our stance is appropriate.",""
"2019-01-30","Full Text","We think there’s no pressing need to change our policy stance and no need to rush to judgment there.",""
"2019-01-30","Full Text","Remember that our inflation objective is a symmetric one,",""
"2019-01-30","Full Text","meaning that we are— we’re always trying to get to 2 percent,",""
"2019-01-30","Full Text","and we don’t look at—we look at inflation equally on both sides.",""
"2019-01-30","Full Text","So I can’t get into specific hypotheticals,",""

"2019-01-30","Full Text","We’ll be looking at everything, but I do think that, you know, muted inflation pressures—you know, you would want—I would want to see a need for further rate increases, and, for me, a big part of that would be inflation.",""

"2019-01-30","Full Text","So today I’m here to talk about decisions and also discussions about decisions that haven’t been made.",""
"2019-01-30","Full Text","So we’re talking about the latter thing,",""
"2019-01-30","Full Text","and so I can’t get ahead of where decisions are.",""
"2019-01-30","Full Text","But so the Committee is— what we’re looking to do is create a whole plan that will bring us to our goal,",""
"2019-01-30","Full Text","which is a balance sheet no larger than it needs to be for us to efficiently conduct— efficiently and effectively conduct monetary policy,",""

"2019-01-30","Full Text","There no decisions have been made.",""

"2019-01-30","Full Text","And that was reflected in the last minutes, actually.",""
"2019-01-30","Full Text","Let me say that the question of the ultimate composition of our balance sheet in the longer run is a very important one,",""

"2019-01-30","Full Text","There are benefits and costs to doing— to taking different approaches,",""
"2019-01-30","Full Text","and I wouldn’t want to prejudge them today.",""
"2019-01-30","Full Text","I’d point to a couple of things.",""
"2019-01-30","Full Text","First, the narrative of slowing global growth continues, if you will.",""
"2019-01-30","Full Text","The incoming data have shown more of that.",""
"2019-01-30","Full Text","We’ve seen that both in China and in Western Europe,",""
"2019-01-30","Full Text","and so that’s an important—that has important implications for us,",""
"2019-01-30","Full Text","and that story has—let’s just say it continues.",""
"2019-01-30","Full Text","I think important—possibly less important now—probably less important now,",""
"2019-01-30","Full Text","which will leave some sort of imprint on first- second period—second quarter.",""
"2019-01-30","Full Text","So those things—in addition, you know, you have to look back.",""
"2019-01-30","Full Text","Financial conditions began to tighten in the fourth quarter.",""
"2019-01-30","Full Text","And they now have persisted and remain tighter— significantly tighter,",""
"2019-01-30","Full Text","and that’s something that we have to take into account as well.",""
"2019-01-30","Full Text","patience—I think we’re going to know in hindsight,",""
"2019-01-30","Full Text","because the length of this patient period is going to depend entirely on incoming data and its implications for the outlook.",""
"2019-01-30","Full Text","So that’s going to be—so it’s hard to say,",""
"2019-01-30","Full Text","it’s hard to think of what to call it at this point or how to label it.",""
"2019-01-30","Full Text","So really, your second question is about how do we think about financial conditions.",""
"2019-01-30","Full Text","We think about a broad range of financial conditions,",""
"2019-01-30","Full Text","And what matters for financial conditions is,",""
"2019-01-30","Full Text","when there are changes and those changes are sustained for a period of time,",""

"2019-01-30","Full Text","to most things that happen in the financial markets.",""
"2019-01-30","Full Text","But when we see a sustained change in financial conditions,",""
"2019-01-30","Full Text","then that’s something that has to play into our thinking.",""
"2019-01-30","Full Text","our policy works through changing financial conditions,",""
"2019-01-30","Full Text","so it’s sort of the essence of what we do.",""
"2019-01-30","Full Text","I can—we don’t comment on individual investigations or whether they’re happening.",""
"2019-01-30","Full Text","I will say that we take our enforcement powers very seriously,",""
"2019-01-30","Full Text","and we put them to work when we feel it’s justified.",""
"2019-01-30","Full Text","In terms of real-time payments, it’s something we’re very actively working on.",""
"2019-01-30","Full Text","As you obviously know, we have some proposals out, and we’re considering them.",""
"2019-01-30","Full Text","it’s very important in that space to consult with the full range of market participants and interest groups,",""
"2019-01-30","Full Text","We don’t have plenary authority to just do things,",""
"2019-01-30","Full Text","We’ve been more of a convener,",""
"2019-01-30","Full Text","bringing industry and the public—public interest groups—and all those groups around the table.",""
"2019-01-30","Full Text","And we’ve—I think we’ve played a constructive role in that respect,",""
"2019-01-30","Full Text","and I believe that will continue.",""
"2019-01-30","Full Text","not to raise rates—to stop raising rates.",""
"2019-01-30","Full Text","How would you respond to those who would suggest that the Fed just caved to the president’s demands?",""
"2019-01-30","Full Text","the only thing we care about at the Fed—is doing our job for the American people and using our tools appropriately.",""

"2019-01-30","Full Text","but—we could be in a situation where we’d like to cut rates more than we can effectively,",""

"2019-01-30","Full Text","it would be from a longer shutdown or perhaps a second shutdown,",""

"2019-05-01","Full Text","And the transmission of the federal funds rate into other short-term rates—money market rates—has been very good over a long period of time.",""

"2019-05-01","Full Text","I would say that the financial system is quite resilient to shocks of various kinds with high capital and liquidity.",""

"2019-05-01","Full Text","The fiscal changes were hitting the economy in a very positive way.",""

"2019-05-01","Full Text","most of the misses are on the downside—inflation expectations over time could be pulled down,",""

"2019-05-01","Full Text","And that includes us, although we’ve actually done— creates significant challenges.",""

"2019-05-01","Full Text","And that’s one of the reasons we’re having a review of our monetary policy strategies,",""
"2019-05-01","Full Text","and communications this year—to think about that problem.",""

"2019-05-01","Full Text","we see that reading as—it’s still a positive reading and consistent with what we expect from the manufacturing sector,",""

"2019-05-01","Full Text","I don’t mean to diminish concerns about too-low inflation,",""
"2019-05-01","Full Text","but I think there’s good reason to think that these readings are particularly influenced by some transitory factors.",""

"2019-05-01","Full Text","which would tend to go down when asset prices go down,",""

"2019-05-01","Full Text","but there’s reason to think that those would be transient and would turn around.",""

"2019-05-01","Full Text","there are models that look at inflation in different ways,",""
"2019-05-01","Full Text","So trimmed mean—it cuts off the big movements on the upside and the downside and looks at just the mean movements in inflation of various product categories and service categories,",""
"2019-05-01","Full Text","I don’t know whether it went down or was above that,",""
"2019-05-01","Full Text","So there’s reason to think that these will be transient.",""
"2019-05-01","Full Text","We, of course, will be watching very carefully to see that that is the case.",""

"2019-05-01","Full Text","I’d like to say we’re going to be watching inflation carefully to see that these things are transient,",""
"2019-05-01","Full Text","and I’ll end by saying we are strongly committed to the 2 percent inflation objective.",""

"2019-05-01","Full Text","Stable prices is half of our mandate, and we’ve defined that as 2 percent.",""
"2019-05-01","Full Text","So we would be concerned, and we’d take it into account.",""
"2019-05-01","Full Text","I can’t really be any more specific than what I’ve said.",""
"2019-05-01","Full Text","Well, we don’t see any evidence at all of overheating, for one thing.",""

"2019-05-01","Full Text","If you look at the labor market,",""

"2019-06-19","Full Text","and not react just to data points or just to changes in sentiment,",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","we are—we’re quite mindful of the risks to the outlook and are prepared to move and use our tools as needed to sustain the expansion.",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","I think the law is clear that I have a four-year term, and I fully intend to serve it.",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","So we’re always trying to balance that risk,",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","given the quite recent nature of some of the events,",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","that the right thing to do was to wait and see more.",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","And we will see a lot more on all of these issues in the very near term.",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","So I don’t think the risk of waiting too long is prominent right now.",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","I would say, as a general matter, it’s always something that we have to weigh.",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","But I think we believe that the right thing here is to watch carefully in the near term and see how these risks unfold and see whether they continue to weigh on the outlook.",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","Obviously, we try to avoid going prematurely as well.",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","In this case, you know, there’s always some judgment in these things.",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","But I would just say that the risks that we see having emerged are risks that have gotten our attention and that have called a number of us to write down rate cuts,",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","and a number of those who haven’t to see that the case has strengthened.",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","Let me let me say the same thing as I said the last time,",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","before there had been any dissents,",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","and that is that I think the process of careful,",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","thoughtful dissent is a very healthy one,",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","and I’ve always believed that.",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","And I feel like you make better decisions when you",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","I think all central banks are focused on their domestic— their mandates are domestic,",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","and they’re focused on economic conditions from a domestic standpoint.",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","And that goes for the European Central Bank,",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","it goes for all central banks.",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","So that’s our principal focus.",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","to the extent you see stronger financial conditions and stronger activity in the ECB after a rate cut,",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","that would support—tend to support activity.3 So we’re really focused on,",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","the risks to our—on the baseline outlook,",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","which is still a pretty favorable one,",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","and the risks to those outlooks.",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","So let me let me answer the inflation question first.",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","So we’re saying that we know—I noted in the statement and also in my—what I said here.",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","We saw that market-based measures of inflation expectations, breakevens, dropped.",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","We noted that also in the statement.",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","And I noted it as a reason for us to—one of several reasons why it feels to us that the case for more accommodation has strengthened.",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","the actual forecast for inflation for this year,",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","So that means a more prolonged shortfall of inflation.",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","it’s something I’ve been concerned about for quite a long time.",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","It’s one of the principal reasons why I called for the review.",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","In a world where policy rates are going to be closer to the effective lower bound,",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","we need to be really strong on 2 percent inflation.",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","we certainly don’t want to be seen as weak on inflation,",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","And I think it’s just something we do.",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","You know that my view on the dots is that they,",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","provide useful information for people,",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","but that we need to do our absolute best to explain what they are and what they are not.",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","they are not a forecast of the group,",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","they’re not discussed or debated at the meeting,",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","they’re an input to policy more than an output of policy,",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","and they’re also only the most likely case.",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","in a situation where there’s relatively high uncertainty,",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","but the second most likely case might only be a little bit less likely.",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","But that doesn’t show up in the dot.",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","The dot is either one thing or it’s another.",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","if you pay too close attention to the dots,",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","then you may lose sight of the larger picture.",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","On the specific question of that,",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","that’s just something we haven’t really engaged with yet,",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","and it will depend very heavily on incoming data and the evolving risk More generally,",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","the research you refer to essentially notes that,",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","in a world where you are closer to the effective lower bound,",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","it’s why—research kind of shows this—it’s wise to react,",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","to prevent a weakening from turning into a prolonged weakening.",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","In other words, sort of, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","So I think that is a valid way to think about policy in this era.",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","I don’t know—and it’s always in the—I think it’s in the minds of policymakers,",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","because it’s well understood to be correct.",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","I don’t know what that means in terms of the size of a particular rate cut going forward.",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","That’s going to depend heavily upon,",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","the actual data and the evolving risk picture.",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","there was not much support for cutting rates now at this meeting.",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","There was, as you see, a number of people wrote down rate cuts.",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","felt that it would be better to see more to—before moving.",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","And I gave a couple of reasons why that is the case.",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","it’s just the fact that some of these developments are so recent that we want to see whether they’ll sustain.",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","So we felt that it would be better to get a clearer picture of things,",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","learn a lot about these developments in the near term.",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","the question we’re going to be asking ourselves is,",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","are these risks going to be continuing to weigh on the outlook?",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","and use our tools to expand—to sustain the expansion.",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","Well, you gave a pretty good picture.",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","the big pieces of it are this:",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","The baseline outlook has been a good one,",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","and that has basically been consumer spending coming back up in the second quarter.",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","And consumer spending is at a healthy level, and that makes sense.",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","You’ve got a tight labor market.",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","You’ve got companies in surveys saying that labor is scarce.",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","You’ve got workers in surveys saying that jobs are plentiful.",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","You’ve got high levels of household confidence.",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","underlying fundamentals for the consumer spending part of the economy,",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","which is 70 percent of the economy,",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","if you take a three-month average,",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","the entry—level of entry into the workforce.",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","So that part of the economy is solid.",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","You mentioned manufacturing, and we’re seeing this all around the world.",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","Manufacturing, investment, and trade have been weaker.",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","It’s not solely a domestic issue,",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","and it may be that there are a range of factors that are contributing to that,",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","what China has done over the last couple of years in working to bring down its leverage.",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","Some of it may be uncertainty over your supply chains due to trade developments.",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","The Boeing 737 issues may be contributing in their own way.",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","So there—lower oil prices are contributing to lower investment,",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","although they’re also leading to lower gas prices,",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","So there are many, many things.",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","There isn’t any one thing that explains it all.",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","But it’s something that low unemployment,",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","that’s kind of the two big pieces of it that you see.",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","Then you see the crosscurrents.",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","If you lay the crosscurrents on top of that—concerns about global growth and trade developments—you have the full picture.",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","And I think what that picture—what we took away from that picture is that we’d like to see more,",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","we want to watch and see whether they continue to weigh upon the outlook.",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","and we’re committed and sworn to use them to support economic activity.",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","And they do support economic activity through a number of channels that are reasonably well understood—some more directly tied to interest rates than others.",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","But we do generally believe that—that our interest rate policy can support demand and support business investment as well.",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","And so we will use those tools and use them as we see as appropriate to achieve our objectives,",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","which really are to sustain this expansion,",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","and I would just make a note of that.",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","The reason why we say “sustain the expansion” is,",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","communities that are being brought into the benefits of this expansion that hadn’t reasons why we think it’s so important to sustain the expansion,",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","because we really are benefiting groups that haven’t seen,",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","this kind of prosperity in a long time.",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","So we take the—you know, we take the crosscurrents as a given, and we have our tools.",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","You know, we don’t—we react to anything in principle that could undermine our achievement of our dual-mandate goals—maximum employment, stable prices—is worthy of our attention and can call forth a policy response.",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","And that’s just how we look at it.",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","You know, I don’t—I don’t discuss elected officials publicly or privately, really.",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","So I would just say that we are—at the Fed,",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","we’re deeply committed to carrying out our mission,",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","and also that our independence from direct political control we see as an important institutional feature that has served both the economy and the country well.",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","on your specific question of digital currencies replacing central bank currencies,",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","I think we’re a long way from that.",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","And, of course, the—so I think we’re a long way from that.",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","Digital currencies are in their infancy.",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","the central banks no longer being able to carry out monetary policy because of cryptocurrencies or digital currencies.",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","has made quite broad rounds in—around the world really with regulators,",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","and lots of people to discuss their plans,",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","and that certainly includes us.",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","And we’re—you know, it’s something we’re looking at.",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","We meet with a broad range of private-sector firms all the time on financial technology,",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","and there’s just a tremendous amount of innovation going on out there.",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","You know, there are potential benefits here.",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","There are also potential risks,",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","particularly of a currency that could,",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","that could potentially have large application.",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","So I would echo what Governor Carney said,",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","which is that we will wind up having quite high expectations,",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","from a sort of safety and soundness and regulatory standpoint,",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","if they do decide to go forward with something.",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","You know, we have—we don’t have plenary authority over cryptocurrencies as such.",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","They play into our world through consumer protection and money laundering and things like that.",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","we have significant input into the payment system and,",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","play an important role in the payment system here in the United States.",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","is that outside experts are excited and are—like the idea of the Fed shifting your inflation target up to 4 percent—around there,",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","and that there’s no—2 percent is not,",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","It seems that you’ve taken that off the table.",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","So I was wondering if you could discuss that.",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","Have you taken it off the table?",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","And then, if so, why, or—and what’s your thoughts on that?",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","We have—we’ve said that we wouldn’t look at raising the target rate for inflation.",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","And the reason is, it’s become a global norm, 2 percent.",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","Our statutory mandate is price stability.",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","And so we’re actually taking a less—we’re looking at less radical ideas,",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","such as how to make the 2 percent inflation objective more credible.",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","This gives me a chance to say a couple things about the review and Chicago,",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","It’s something that—I thought it was both appropriate and important for us to do.",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","It’ll be a yearlong, or even longer, process, looking at our strategy, tools, and communications.",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","And it’s meant to be a way to open ourselves up,",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","and have dialogue and criticism with the constituencies that we serve.",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","We’ve had a series of Fed Listens around the country at every Reserve Bank,",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","and we had an academic conference earlier this month,",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","with seven papers written and criticized,",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","that the heart of the conference was the two panels on—with practitioners in low and moderate income—who live in low- and moderate-income communities and are part of those communities.",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","people were quite struck by their intervention,",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","which was really uniformly around how important maximum employment is have had is low unemployment,",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","companies who want to hire and are bringing people into the—providing opportunities for people to come into the labor force to an extent not seen in quite a long time.",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","for someone who does this work,",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","that was very focusing and motivating,",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","So I think everybody thought, you know, that’s—that was really quite worth doing.",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","there was some thought at the beginning that we should—some people recommended that we just talk to,",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","that’s not what we chose to do,",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","and we’re glad this is the choice we made.",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","I don’t think it’s—I don’t think it’s a practical alternative.",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","I think you see disinflationary pressures around the world.",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","You see central banks having a hard time getting inflation up to their—close to their objective.",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","We’ve done better than other large central banks that are not, you know, open economies, like the",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","So the 2013 guidance is not binding,",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","and that’s what came out of the GAO review.",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","But that’s really the beginning of this—of the story.",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","we have the authority we need to examine the banks for safety and soundness exposure.",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","this—the first thing you start with as a bank supervisor is the risks that the banks are taking to themselves through their portfolio,",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","through the risks that they’re running and the pipeline—you know,",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","the obligations that they’ve undertaken to underwrite deals.",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","And so we monitor that very carefully—so do the banks—and you see exposures that are much smaller than they were before the crisis.",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","And, by the way, we test that regularly in the stress tests.",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","We impose very large losses on those portfolios,",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","so we kind of have a sense of what that is,",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","there was a lot of lack of knowledge about what the losses would be.",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","So that’s where it starts for us in supervision,",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","is the risks that the banks are running—you know,",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","running on their own books and to themselves and to each other.",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","I feel—I feel like that is—that’s in a good place,",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","but we never—we never say “Mission accomplished” on that.",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","We will keep—you know, keep monitoring that carefully.",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","know, we have a good sense of, domestically, of where that paper is.",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","and the Financial Stability Board is actually looking more carefully at that.",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","And we— you know, we monitor those vehicles to see what they are.",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","And they’re actually pretty stably funded,",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","in the sense that there’s no run risk,",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","but there’s still macroeconomic risk.",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","this is something that we take very seriously and that the FSOC,",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","the Financial Stability Oversight Council,",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","we call it out as a macroeconomic risk,",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","but it’s not really a financial stability risk,",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","in the sense that it could undermine the ability of the financial system to do its job of intermediating credit.",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","I think the issue isn’t that the banks don’t understand what the rules are.",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","The issue is that the risk isn’t in the banks.",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","It’s in—it’s out in those market-based vehicles.",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","I no longer am day-to-day involved in this as I was before I took this job.",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","But my sense is, though, that that’s really not the problem.",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","but I think we do understand what risks the banks are running.",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","how concerned should we be about large holdings by market-based vehicles that I mentioned,",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","and what risks do they present?",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","And we’re very carefully assessing that.",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","because more jobs are being created than people are entering the labor force.",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","The unemployment rate is lower.",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","by just lots and lots of numbers,",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","the labor market is in a good place.",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","So the level of wages is very consistent with what it should be,",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","in the sense that it’s approximately equal to inflation plus productivity increases on an hourly basis.",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","is that you could reach these levels of unemployment late—you know,",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","and not see even higher wages that are pushing up on inflation,",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","even though they’re growing at a healthy rate,",""

"2019-06-19","Full Text","we watch—we watch all of this very carefully,",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","and I think we’re very careful about not assuming that we’re,",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","that would—that there’s no more slack in the labor market.",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","we’ve all lived through—you know,",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","we were in the 8 percent–plus range,",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","and it’s just gone down and down and down,",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","and you haven’t seen wages picked up.",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","You haven’t seen real signals that we’re at maximum employment.",""

"2019-06-19","Full Text","Balance sheet runoff is very close to the end of its planned life.",""
"2019-06-19","Full Text","I would say this: If we do provide more accommodation—again,",""

"2019-06-19","Full Text","we’ll certainly keep in mind what we said earlier this year,",""

"2019-07-31","Q&A","we moved to a patient setting for a few months,",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","I think what you’ve seen over the course of the year is,",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","as we’ve moved to a more accommodative policy,",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","the economy has actually performed just about as expected with that gradually increasing support.",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","And I think—I wouldn’t take credit for all of that,",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","but I do think that increasing policy support has kept the economy on track and kept the outlook favorable.",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","In terms of the rest of your question,",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","the Committee is really thinking of this as a way of adjusting policy to a somewhat more accommodative stance to further the three objectives that I mentioned:",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","to insure against downside risks,",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","to provide support to the economy,",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","that those factors are—where factors are pushing down on economic growth,",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","and then to support inflation.",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","So we do think it will serve all of those goals,",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","we’re thinking of it as essentially in the nature of a midcycle adjustment to policy.",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","The—the performance of the economy has been reasonably good.",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","The position of the economy is as close to our objectives as it’s been that everywhere:",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","particularly in the European Union and China.",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","we see trade policy developments,",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","which at times have been disruptive and then have been less so,",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","and also inflation running below target.",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","So we see those as threats to what is clearly a favorable outlook,",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","and we see this action as designed to support them and keep that outlook favorable.",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","it is a continuation of what we’ve been doing all year to provide more support against those very same risks.",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","and I think the evidence of my eyes tells me that our policy does support—it supports confidence,",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","and through channels that we understand.",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","So it will lower borrowing costs.",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","since we noted our vigilance about the situation in June,",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","you saw financial conditions move up,",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","and you saw—I won’t take credit for the whole recovery,",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","but you saw financial conditions move up.",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","You see confidence, which had troughed in June—you saw it move back up.",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","You see economic activity on a healthy basis.",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","It just—it seems to work through confidence channels as well as the mechanical channels that you are talking about.",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","I mean, I think we—of course, you know, what we do at every meeting, as I noted, is, we do a deep dive into",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","So I gave three reasons for what we did, and that is to insure against downside risks to the outlook from weak global growth and trade tensions.",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","So that is—in a sense, that is a risk-management point, and that is a bit of insurance.",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","But we also feel like weak global growth and trade tensions are having an effect on the",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","So I actually think different people have different—different weightings has been my experience on those things.",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","trade slowdown— and I would actually add,",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","lower natural rate of unemployment too has moved down,",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","all of which Committee moving away from rate increases to a neutral posture to,",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","So I think we’ve been providing—and that affects the forward rate path,",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","and it affects financial conditions,",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","and financial conditions affect the economy.",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","You see an economy which is actually performing pretty well.",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","Growth in the first half of this year is about the same as it was in all of ’18 and actually a little better than our forecast for growth in 2019—at the end of 2019.",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","So I think, in a way, that’s monetary policy working.",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","I wouldn’t just look at the 25 basis point cut as the right question.",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","as we noted—we noted at the bottom of the statement that language,",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","which really says how we’re thinking about it.",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","as we’re contemplating the future path of the target range for the federal funds rate,",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","we’ll continue to monitor the implications of incoming information—and it talks about that language.",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","I can’t— all I can tell you is,",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","we’ll be looking at weak global growth.",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","We’ll be looking very carefully to see how that’s happening.",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","And I think you see—you learn—every cycle you learn about these things.",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","So we will see whether growth is picking up, whether it’s bottoming out.",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","we’re going to be seeing—I think we’ve learned a lot on trade in this be more precise,",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","it is a factor that we have to assess in kind of a new way.",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","Those are the things that we’ll be looking at,",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","in making our decisions going forward.",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","So we don’t hear that from businesses.",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","the federal funds rate is too high.” I haven’t heard that from a business.",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","What you hear is that demand is weak for their products.",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","You see manufacturing being weak all over the world.",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","And I wouldn’t lay all of that at the door of trade talks.",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","I think there’s a—there’s a global business cycle happening with manufacturing and investment,",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","definitely a bigger factor than,",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","I think global—global growth started to slow down in the middle of last year,",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","but that has gone on to a greater extent.",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","trade policy uncertainty has also been,",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","more elevated than we anticipated.",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","is this the—we believe this is the right move for today,",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","and we think it’s—we think it will serve the three ends that I mentioned.",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","And I’ve already gone over how we’re thinking about going forward.",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","with this move today about future rate moves?",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","Well, the sense of that is—I mean, that refers back to other times when the FOMC has cut rates in the middle of a cycle.",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","And I’m contrasting it there with the beginning—for example, the beginning of a lengthy cutting cycle.",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","That is not—that’s not what we’re seeing now.",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","That’s not our perspective now or outlook.",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","You know, so our policy is—will depend on the implications of incoming data for the economic outlook as well as evolving risks to that outlook.",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","And so we’re going to be monitoring the implications of incoming information for the outlook, as I mentioned.",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","And, so I—that’s really where I would leave you with that.",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","I would say that I view the level of capital requirements and the level of capital in the system as being about right.",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","The idea that you’re talking about is one that’s—that Vice Chair Quarles has talked about.",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","It’s a—it’s one under consideration.",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","to have high through-the-cycle capital requirements by doubling the SIFI surcharge,",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","which is the surcharge that the largest banks have in their capital requirements.",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","We’ve, in effect, already put in place substantial countercyclical buffers.",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","you can think of—I’m not saying it’s the same thing as a countercyclical capital buffer.",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","So that’s—that’s really the point—is that we don’t rely—our system doesn’t rely on our ability—it doesn’t mainly rely on our ability to identify the right time in the cycle to trigger a countercyclical tool.",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","We rely on through-the-cycle, always-on high capital and liquidity requirements.",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","And I think that’s a good thing to do.",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","The idea of putting it in place so you can cut it,",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","that’s something some other jurisdictions have done,",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","has a countercyclical capital buffer that’s always on,",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","but the one point of it is that you can cut when there’s a downturn and therefore give the banks more room.",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","So this isn’t something we’ve decided to do.",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","In terms of the real-time payment system,",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","so this is something we—the United States is far behind other countries in terms of having real-time payments available to the general public.",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","coming out of the Reserve System—the Reserve Banks and the Board together—convened all of the stakeholders around the table to talk about several years.",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","And one of the things that came out of that was a recommendation that the Fed should build a 24 x 7 x 365 real-time settlement system to solve that problem—to address that problem.",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","We put out a proposal in October of last year about,",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","and we got quite a lot of comments.",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","And I would point out that in our payment system,",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","the Fed operates alongside private-sector operators—for example,",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","and in check—so it wouldn’t be unusual or out of keeping with—with how we’ve done things in the past.",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","We have not made a decision on this,",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","but it’s something we’re looking at carefully and something I do expect we’ll make a decision on soon.",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","So it is—as I mentioned, it’s going to depend on the evolving data and the evolving risk picture.",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","But as we look at the situation now and the outlook now, what we see is that it’s appropriate to make an adjustment in policy to a somewhat more accommodative the",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","I think the best thing for people who are—who are feeling that—and we are getting lots of feedback from people who work and live in low- and moderate- income communities to the effect that they’re now feeling the recovery,",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","they haven’t felt a better labor market in anybody’s memory,",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","the best thing we can do for those people is to sustain the expansion,",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","and that’s one of the overarching goals of—of this move and all of our policy moves.",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","There really is no reason why the expansion can’t keep going.",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","Inflation is not troublingly high.",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","So I gave my—my reasons for—our reasons, really—for doing this.",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","this action is designed to insure against downside risks to the outlook from weak global growth and trade tensions,",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","offset the negative effect that those factors are already having,",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","and promote a faster return of inflation to 2 percent.",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","That’s what we’ve been talking about all year long,",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","and we’ve gradually moved our policy in the direction of more accommodation.",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","I think what you see is an economy that has reacted well to that.",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","So that’s what we’re doing, and that’s why we’re doing it.",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","We never take into account political considerations.",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","There’s no place in our discussions for that.",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","We also don’t conduct monetary policy in order to prove our independence.",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","We conduct monetary policy in order to—to move as close as possible to our statutory goals,",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","and that’s what we’re always going to do.",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","We’re always going to use our tools that way.",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","And then, at the end, we’ll—you know, we’ll live with the results.",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","In terms of the balance sheet,",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","that was really just a matter of simplicity and consistency.",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","Really nothing more to it than that.",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","let me say—I’ll just speak for myself,",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","but I understand those concerns very well.",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","I’ve—you know, I’ve studied them, I’ve spoken about them, and I take them very seriously.",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","But as I look at today’s situation,",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","I don’t see them as a reason not to take this action today.",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","I just don’t think—that would be my point.",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","And one of the reasons why I think that is,",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","if you look—if you look—so we have a financial stability framework now for the first time.",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","four big things so that we know we can—you know,",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","the public can hold us accountable and compare us meeting to meeting,",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","and see whether we got this right,",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","But the four things we look at are valuation pressures.",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","And we do see notable valuation pressures in some markets but,",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","not at a highly troubling level.",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","In terms of household borrowing, household and business borrowing is the second thing.",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","Households are in a very good shape overall.",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","I’ll come back to business borrowing.",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","Leverage in the financial system is low, and funding risk is low.",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","staff’s view has been—and my view has been—that if you look overall,",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","financial stability vulnerabilities are moderate.",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","The place that gets all the attention right now—a lot of attention—is business borrowing,",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","and we look very carefully at that.",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","What’s happening with business borrowing is,",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","the loans have moved off the balance sheets of the banks and into market-based vehicles,",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","which tend to be stably funded.",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","it’s clear that the highly leveraged business sector could act as an amplifier to a downturn.",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","So we’re watching that very carefully.",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","I think if you gives us the ability to use monetary policy for its purposes and rely on supervisory and regulatory tools to—you know,",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","to keep the financial system resilient.",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","There are very few things that I don’t worry about at all.",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","So, of course, of course, we monitor.",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","We have—every quarter we have an extensive briefing on financial stability,",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","So we look at this on an ongoing basis.",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","We liaise with central banks around the world.",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","one of my colleagues is the head of the Financial Stability Board globally,",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","very much monitoring these things all the time.",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","And we worry about them all the time.",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","We’re always looking at the—we’re looking for that thing that we may have missed a lot of the time.",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","But the things we haven’t missed,",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","I think they paint a mixed picture,",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","but not one that should prevent us from taking monetary policy actions that we think are appropriate to support the economy.",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","it’s not—it’s not the beginning of a long series of rate cuts.",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","I didn’t—I didn’t say it’s just one or anything like that.",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","when you think about rate-cutting cycles,",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","What we’re seeing is that it’s appropriate to—to adjust policy to a somewhat more accommodative stance over time,",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","and that’s how we’re looking at it.",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","it’s not a long cutting cycle—in other words,",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","referring to what we do when there’s a recession or a very severe downturn.",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","That’s—that’s really what I was ruling out.",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","if you look back at other midcycle adjustments,",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","but you’ll see examples of these.",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","I wouldn’t bring it down to any one trade thing or any one factor.",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","I think we look at a broad range of factors,",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","and trade uncertainty—trade policy uncertainty is one of them.",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","That certainly includes the discussions with China,",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","but I wouldn’t—I wouldn’t be able to tell you how much of it is due to that.",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","we have to react to the developments,",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","and we don’t know what they’ll be,",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","and so it’s hard to exactly say.",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","that when there’s a sharp confrontation between two large economies,",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","you can see effects on business confidence pretty quickly and on financial markets pretty quickly.",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","But then we saw them unwind after that, to some extent.",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","You’ve seen it returning to—to a much lower temperature,",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","You know, the mechanical effects of the tariffs are quite small.",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","They’re not large as it relates to the",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","There’s a range of views on the Committee, and—but the Committee is unified, completely unified on our dedication to making the best policy decisions that we can make.",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","And that means people have a responsibility to do their best thinking and to present that thinking, and I wouldn’t have it any other way.",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","to be following going forward.",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","We’re going to be data dependent.",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","We’re going to be, as we always are, doing what we need to do—what we believe we need to do to support the economic expansion.",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","So the problems at Wells Fargo—that arose at Wells Fargo around risk management and consumer—the way they dealt with the consumer were actually pretty deep,",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","and I think the company realizes that.",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","And they’re not going to be fixed—they haven’t been fixed quickly,",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","we didn’t expect them to be fixed quickly.",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","they—they will be under the growth cap,",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","until the Board votes to lift it,",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","and that’s not something we’re considering doing right now.",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","the company is working away to address these issues,",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","and it just takes time to address them.",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","I wouldn’t comment on the CEO question.",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","I don’t really have anything for you on that.",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","You know, the premise is not—I will question your premise for a second.",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","one of the purposes of our—of our cut today is to support the expansion.",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","And we don’t know when—and if it really works—if that works very well and the economy gets going again,",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","you don’t know where the—where the funds,",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","in other cycles—and I don’t know whether this will happen or not,",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","the Fed wound up raising rates again after a midcycle adjustment.",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","but I don’t think that we know that we won’t have—that we’ll have less ammo because of these things.",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","Well, but you’re assuming that we would never raise rates again, that once we’ve cut these rates that they can never go back up again.",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","Just as a matter of principle, I don’t think that’s right.",""

"2019-07-31","Q&A","We’re just now beginning the process of incorporating all of that feedback,",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","and we’re going to be having a series of meetings,",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","the questions that we’re asking about our framework.",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","So it’s very early to say where that’s going,",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","we’re setting the table now and looking at what our framework is I’m very excited about it.",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","I think it’s been a good exercise.",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","I think it’s opened us up to sunlight and perspectives that we might not have gotten otherwise.",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","you have—10 years after the crisis,",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","you’re really living in a new normal for the economy and monetary policy,",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","and it’s a really good time to step back and ask whether there are some things that we can do to improve our framework.",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","So I think this was—this was well telegraphed.",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","What we did today was—was very consistent with what we had said we were going to do.",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","I had mentioned the reasons for it.",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","I think they will—they will achieve their goals.",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","We do know that monetary policy works through communications and then actions that are consistent with those communications,",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","and we think that the changes that we’ve made this year have really worked.",""
"2019-07-31","Q&A","we always retain the flexibility to adjust our communications and our actions to—in light of incoming data and the evolving risk picture,",""
"2019-09-18","Opening Statement","Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome.",""
"2019-09-18","Opening Statement","My colleagues at the Federal Reserve and I are dedicated to serving the American people.",""
"2019-09-18","Opening Statement","We do this by steadfastly pursuing the goals Congress has given us: maximum employment and stable prices.",""
"2019-09-18","Opening Statement","We are committed to making the best decisions we can based on facts and objective analysis.",""
"2019-09-18","Opening Statement","Today we decided to lower interest rates.",""
"2019-09-18","Opening Statement","As I will explain shortly, we took this step to help keep the",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","as you can see from our policy statement and from the SEP,",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","we see a favorable economic outlook,",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","and inflation near our 2 percent objective.",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","And, by the way, that view is consistent with those of many other forecasters.",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","FOMC participants generally think that these positive economic outcomes will be achieved with modest adjustments to the federal funds rate.",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","1995 and 1998 as examples of such an approach,",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","which was successful in both of those instances.",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","As our statement also highlights,",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","there are risks to this positive outlook due particularly to weak global growth and trade developments.",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","And if the economy does turn down,",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","then a more extensive sequence of rate cuts could be appropriate.",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","We don’t see that—it’s not what we expect—but we would certainly follow that path if it became appropriate.",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","we will continue to monitor these developments closely,",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","and we will act as appropriate to help ensure that the expansion remains on track.",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","So the idea of having a bias is something that was a longtime practice,",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","and we don’t actually have that practice anymore,",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","so I can’t really adopt it right here.",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","But, nonetheless, I’ll respond to your question.",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","So we did—we made one decision today, and always.",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","Our decisions are going to depend on the implications of incoming information for the outlook,",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","that we’re not on a preset course.",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","So that’s how we’re going to look at it.",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","We’re going to be carefully looking at economic data.",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","Sometimes the path ahead is clear and sometimes less so.",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","So we’re going to be looking carefully,",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","at the full range of information,",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","and we’re going to assess the appropriate stance of policy as we go.",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","And, as I said, we will act as appropriate to sustain the expansion.",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","what we do going forward is very much going to depend,",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","on the flow of data and information.",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","if you look at the things we’re monitoring,",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","particularly global growth and trade developments,",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","global growth has continued to weaken.",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","I think it’s weakened since our last meeting.",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","Trade developments have been up and down and then up,",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","perhaps—over the course of this intermeeting period.",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","In any case, they’ve been quite volatile.",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","So we do see those risks as actually more heightened now.",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","We’re going to be watching that carefully.",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","We’re also going to be watching the",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","Well, let me just say, on the general point of diverse perspectives, you’re right.",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","Sometimes the—and there have been many of those times in my now almost eight years at the Fed, many times when the direction is relatively clear and it’s relatively easy to reach unanimity.",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","This is a time of difficult judgments and, as you can see, disparate perspectives.",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","And I really do think that’s nothing but healthy, and so I see a benefit in having those diverse perspectives, really.",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","So I’ll try to get at that this way.",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","I think that the idea that if you see trouble approaching on the horizon,",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","you steer away from it if you can—I think that’s a good idea in principle,",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","and I think history teaches us that it’s better to be proactive in adjusting policy if you can.",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","I think applying that principle in a particular situation is where the challenge comes.",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","So I told you where the Committee—the bulk of the Committee is going,",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","and I think the main takeaway is that this is a Committee that has shifted its policy stance repeatedly,",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","And I think you’ve seen us being willing to move based on data,",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","based on the evolving risk picture,",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","and I have no reason to think that will change.",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","I think—but it will continue to be data dependent,",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","and depend—data includes the evolving risk picture.",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","That’s where I am, and that’s where I think the bulk of the Committee is.",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","so I would say I doubt that anyone is closer to and has more invested in carefully following the—you know,",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","the behavior of these markets.",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","we were well aware of the—you know,",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","the tax payments and also of the settlement of the large bond purchases.",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","And, you know, we were very much waiting for that.",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","But we didn’t expect—the response to that was stronger than we expected.",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","And, by the way, our sense is that it surprised market participants a lot, too.",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","You know, people were writing about this and publishing stories about it weeks ago.",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","but it was—it was a stronger response So,",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","it doesn’t—we don’t see this as having any implications for the broader economy or for the economic outlook,",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","nor for our ability to control rates.",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","The strains in the money markets reflect forces that we saw coming,",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","and they just had a bigger effect than I think most folks anticipated—strong demand for cash to purchase Treasuries and pay corporate taxes.",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","We took appropriate actions to address those pressures,",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","to keep the fed funds rate within the target range,",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","and those measures were successful.",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","If we experience another episode of pressures in money markets,",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","we have the tools to address those pressures.",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","We will not hesitate to use them.",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","And since we’re talking about this, let me take a step back and say this.",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","after careful study over a period of years,",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","the Committee announced the decision to implement monetary policy in an ample-reserves regime.",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","And we’ve been operating in that regime for a full decade.",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","We think it works well to implement our rate decisions.",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","The main hallmark of that regime is that we use adjustments in our administered rates—the IOER and RRP rates—to keep the fed fund rates in the target range.",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","It’s designed specifically so that we do not expect to be conducting frequent open market operations for that purpose.",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","we’re going to be very closely monitoring market developments and assessing their implications for the appropriate level of reserves,",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","and we’re going to be assessing,",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","the question of when it will be appropriate to resume the organic growth of our balance sheet.",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","And I’m sure we’ll be revisiting that question during this intermeeting period and certainly at our next meeting.",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","So we’ve always said that it’s—that the level is uncertain, right?",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","And that’s something we’ve tried to be very clear about.",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","we’ve invested lots of time talking to many of the large holders of reserves to assess their—what they say is their demand for reserves.",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","We try to assess what that is.",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","We’ve tried to combine all of that together.",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","We put it out so the public can react to it.",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","and it is certainly possible that we will need to resume the organic growth of the balance sheet earlier than we thought.",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","That’s always been a possibility, and it certainly is now.",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","we’ll be looking at this carefully in coming days and taking it up at the next meeting.",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","So I think to provide a little context, Fed economists do research all the time.",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","It’s generally of very high quality.",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","It’s not an official finding of the Federal Reserve Board or the Federal Reserve System.",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","they put it out for public review so that you can see their econometrics,",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","so you can see all of it— their whole work is exposed to critique by the whole profession.",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","So it’s a great tradition that we have.",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","what this particular piece of work did is,",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","it went after measuring trade while I would say,",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","there’s real uncertainty around these— around these effects.",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","To try to isolate the effects of certain things is very challenging,",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","So—and this piece of research found significant effects,",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","and that’s frankly consistent with a number of other research projects that economists have undertaken.",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","It’s also consistent with what we’ve been hearing in the Beige Book.",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","I think if you take a step back from that,",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","we do feel that trade uncertainty is having an effect.",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","You see it in weak business investment, weak exports—hard to quantify it precisely, though.",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","And you’re asking specifically about 2020?",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","You know, honestly, I think it’s hard to have hardened expectations about where rate policy is going to be a year from now.",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","I think the closer you get to the current day, the more confidence you can have.",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","But even then, knowing where the—knowing what the around that.",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","Particularly, if you look at 2020, I think the use of this is, individual participants write down their forecasts.",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","It should give you a sense of how people are thinking about the likely path of the economy and the appropriate path for monetary policy in that individual person’s thinking, and I think that’s a good thing to know.",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","I think I’d be very reluctant to look at it as hardened views or a prediction, really.",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","You know, well, I think, if you look at the",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","You know, I think it’s hard to deal with every hypothetical possibility.",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","I think, for the foreseeable future, we’re going to be looking at, if needed, doing the sorts of things that we did the last two days—these temporary open market operations.",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","That will be the tool that we use.",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","And the question will be, then—as we go through quarter-end, as we learn more, you know, what really—how much of this really has to do with the level of reserves?",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","And I think we’ll learn quite a lot in the next six weeks.",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","You know, so I think if we concluded that we needed to raise the level of required reserves for banks to meet the LCR, we’d probably raise the level of reserves rather than lower the",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","I think we want banks to, you know—to use their liquidity buffers in times of stress rather than pull back from the markets and pull back from serving their clients as a general rule.",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","that trade policy is not the business of the Fed,",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","it’s the business of Congress and the Administration.",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","But—so why are we talking about it?",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","We’re talking about it because anything that affects the achievement of our goals can,",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","be something that monetary policy should take into consideration.",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","And our discussions and the research we have suggests that trade policy is something that’s weighing on the outlook.",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","So I pointed out in recent remarks that the thing we can’t address,",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","is what businesses would like,",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","which is a settled roadmap for international trade.",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","But we do have a very powerful tool which can counteract weakness,",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","by supporting demand through sound monetary policy.",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","And we think our policy tools support economic activity through fairly well-understood channels:",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","by reducing interest and also investment by businesses;",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","and also by boosting household and business confidence.",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","I don’t want to be heard to say that our tools don’t have an effect.",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","But I was making the point that there is a piece of this that we really can’t address.",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","There’s no simple bottom-line answer where I can say,",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","But what it amounts to is this:",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","What you see is probably the kind of volatility that’s typical of an important,",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","And I think what we need to do is to try to look through the volatility and react to the underlying forces,",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","the underlying things that are happening that are relevant to our mandate.",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","We don’t—we have nothing to do with setting trade policy or negotiating trade agreements.",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","We’re supposed to be reacting on behalf of the American economy to support maximum employment and stable prices.",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","So we need to look through what’s a pretty volatile situation.",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","So that means not overreacting quickly.",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","It means not underreacting, too.",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","So that’s really what we’re trying to do.",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","the outlook is positive in the face of these crosswinds we’ve felt.",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","I do believe that our shifting to a more accommodative stance over the course of the year has been one of the reasons why the outlook has remained favorable.",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","So what we are looking for through all of the data,",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","all the events that are going on around the world,",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","we’ll be looking at global growth,",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","we’ll be looking at trade policy uncertainty.",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","Most importantly, we’ll be looking at the performance of the",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","I think the general principle,",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","it can be a mistake to try to hold onto your firepower until a downturn gains momentum,",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","and then—so there’s a fair amount of research that would show that that’s the case.",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","Now, I think that principle needs to be applied carefully to the situation at hand.",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","What we believe we’re facing here—what we think we’re facing here is a situation which can be addressed and should be addressed with moderate adjustments to the federal funds rate.",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","As I mentioned, we are watching carefully to see whether that is the case.",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","then we’re prepared to be aggressive,",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","and we’ll do so if it turns out to be appropriate.",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","You mentioned negative interest rates.",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","So negative interest rates is something that we looked at during the financial crisis and chose not to do.",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","We chose to—after we got to the effective lower bound,",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","we chose to do a lot of aggressive forward guidance and also large-scale asset purchases,",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","and those were the two unconventional monetary policy tools that we used extensively.",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","We feel that they worked fairly well.",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","We did not use negative rates.",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","And I think if we were to find ourselves at some future date again at the effective lower bound—again,",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","not something we are expecting—then I think we would look at using large-scale asset purchases and forward guidance.",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","I do not think we’d be looking at using negative rates.",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","I just don’t think those will be at the top of our list.",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","we are in the middle of a monetary policy review where we’re looking through all of these questions about the longer-run framework—the strategy,",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","and communications—and we expect that to be completed sometime around the middle of next year.",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","extent will it offset the negative effects of the trade uncertainty and tensions?",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","in terms of how our rate cuts will affect the real economy,",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","we think monetary policy works with,",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","So I think the real effects will be felt over time.",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","we think that lower interest rates will reduce interest burden for borrowers,",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","so that interest-sensitive things like housing and durable goods and other things like that—cars—it supports purchases of those.",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","Just, again, broadly, more accommodative financial conditions—higher asset prices.",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","That’s—the models and the data show that that’s another powerful channel.",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","I also think there’s a confidence channel.",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","You see—you see household and business confidence turn up when financial conditions become more accommodative.",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","So I think, through all of those channels, monetary policy works.",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","precisely the right tool for every single possible negative thing that can happen to the economy,",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","we’re going to use the tool we have.",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","And if it comes to it, we’ll use all of our tools.",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","So that’s how we think it works and how we think it’s working.",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","It’s—you know, it’s tough to say.",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","We’ll— we’ll use our tools to offset negative—that’s really the job of monetary policy, is, to the extent it can, to offset, you know, things that drive us away from maximum employment and stable prices.",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","if you look at—if you actually look at households,",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","households are in very strong shape.",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","They’ve got more income relative to their interest requirements.",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","And they’re in very good shape—much better shape than they were in before the financial crisis.",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","So the household sector as a sort of aggregate matter is in very good shape.",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","That doesn’t mean that every single person in the household sector is in good shape,",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","The business sector is something that,",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","we’ve talked about a lot and studied a lot,",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","and the situation there is that the level of debt relative to GDP in the business sector is at a high level.",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","However, so is the size of the business sector.",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","So, actually, the business sector itself is not materially higher leveraged than it was.",""

"2019-09-18","Q&A","and I think our view still is that that’s a real issue,",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","but what it really represents is a potential amplifier of a macroeconomic downturn.",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","It does not have the makings of anything that would undermine the workings of the financial system,",""

"2019-09-18","Q&A","so you—and even the Fed thinks the downside risks are rising.",""

"2019-09-18","Q&A","do you think GDP growth is going to hold steady,",""

"2019-09-18","Q&A","I think I personally see a high value in sustaining the expansion,",""
"2019-09-18","Q&A","because we really are reaching—this positive economy is reaching communities that haven’t been reached in a long time.",""

"2019-10-30","Q&A","The performance of the economy has been—particularly the household sector—has been strong,",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","attractive levels of job creation,",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","labor force participation moving up,",""

"2019-10-30","Q&A","The manufacturing sector, particularly manufacturing, and also investment and exports have been weaker.",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","But, overall, we’ve seen moderate growth, a strong labor market, inflation moving up.",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","We see the outlook as for more of the same.",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","We also see the risks to the outlook as perhaps having moved in a positive direction over the course of this intermeeting period,",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","some remain—some things remain to be seen.",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","we’ve moved the stance of policy over the course of the year to a more accommodative stance,",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","after the cuts at the last three meetings,",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","the federal funds rate is now mentioned,",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","we’re going to be watching all factors,",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","And if developments emerge that cause a material reassessment of our outlook,",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","But that’s what it would take: a material reassessment of our outlook.",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","We’ll be looking at a full range of data about the economy and about the risks to the outlook, and I’ve given you a sense of what our outlook is.",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","It’s for moderate growth, a strong labor market, and inflation near our 2 percent objective.",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","If something happens to cause us to materially reassess that outlook, that’s what would cause us to change our views on the appropriate stance of policy.",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","what I was referring to there—the principal risks that we’ve been monitoring have been,",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","slowing global growth and trade policy developments as well as muted inflation pressure.",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","So I was really referring there to trade developments.",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","We have that phase-one potential agreement with China,",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","if signed and put into effect,",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","could have the effect of reducing trade tensions and reducing uncertainty,",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","for business confidence and perhaps activity over time.",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","So that has situations there’s plenty of risk left,",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","but I’d have to say that the risks seem to have subsided.",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","You asked about business investment, and that’s right.",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","Business investment has been weak, and today’s reading was weak as well.",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","And it was broad across equipment and other parts of—all parts of business fixed investment were weak.",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","That’s consistent with what we’ve seen, but that’s the economy we’ve had this year.",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","What we’ve had is an economy where the consumer is really driving growth,",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","personal consumption expenditures were almost 3 percent in this quarter—in this first reading for the quarter.",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","we see the economy as having been resilient to the—you know,",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","the winds that have been blowing this year.",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","That’s a risk that we’ve been monitoring, but we don’t see it yet.",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","We don’t see rising initial claims or layoffs or anything like that.",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","But the risk you mention of the weakness in the manufacturing—in export investment,",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","parts of the economy getting into the consumer side of the economy,",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","What we continue to see is good job creation.",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","and the household survey is now at a 50-year low—has been,",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","very close to 50-year lows for 18 months now.",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","The consumer-facing companies that we talk to in our vast network of contacts report,",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","that consumers are doing well and are focused on,",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","So the reason why we raised interest rates is because—generally is because we see inflation as moving up—or,",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","in danger of moving up significantly,",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","and we really don’t see that now.",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","Inflation moved down in the first quarter of this year.",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","We thought that that was due, to some extent, to idiosyncratic or transient factors.",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","That turns out to have been the case, so it’s moved back up.",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","But it seems to be settling in below 2 percent.",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","So we really don’t see that risk.",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","And inflation expectations have also kind of moved down and sideways—both surveys and market based over the course of this—of,",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","we think that inflation expectations are very important in driving actual inflation,",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","and we’re strongly committed to achieving our 2 percent inflation objective on a symmetric basis.",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","We think it’s essential that we do that.",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","So we’re not thinking about raising rates right now.",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","There obviously will be times in the future where that will be appropriate.",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","What we’re really thinking now is that our current stance",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","So we think that the current stance of policy is likely to remain appropriate—likely to remain appropriate—as long as incoming information about the economy is broadly consistent with our outlook,",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","which is a positive one of moderate economic growth,",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","and inflation moving close to 2 percent.",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","That’s—so that’s what we’re saying about that.",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","if developments emerge that cause a material reassessment of that outlook,",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","So that’s really how we’re thinking about it.",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","I can’t point to one data point or one thing that would change our minds.",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","It really—it would be a reassessment of—a material reassessment of our overall outlook,",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","we do think that inflation expectations are— they’re quite essential,",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","quite central in our framework of how we think about inflation.",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","We need them to be anchored in a level—at a level that’s consistent with our symmetric 2 percent inflation goal.",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","And we think that we need to conduct policy in a way that supports that outcome.",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","changes to the way we think about things,",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","changes to the framework that would lead us—that would be more supportive of achieving inflation on a 2 percent—on a symmetric 2 percent basis over time.",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","That’s at the very heart of what we’re doing in the review.",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","It’s too early to be announcing decisions.",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","But we’re in the middle of thinking about ways that we can make that symmetric 2 percent inflation objective more credible by achieving symmetric 2 percent inflation.",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","And it comes down to using your policy tools to achieve 2 percent inflation,",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","and that is the—that is the thing that must happen for credibility in this area.",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","So we’re committed to doing that.",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","So we’re in the middle—we’re really quite in the middle of it now, and my thinking is still that it will run into the middle of next year.",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","These are—you know, these changes to monetary policy frameworks happen—they don’t happen really quickly, let’s say.",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","Inflation targeting took many years to evolve.",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","I don’t think we’ll take many years here.",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","I think we’ll wrap it up around the middle of next year, would be my guess.",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","I have some confidence in that.",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","So I would just say that a—if we were to have a sustained reduction in trade tensions—broad reduction in trade tensions and a resolution of these uncertainties,",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","that would bode well for business sentiment,",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","which is—trade uncertainty’s been weighing on business sentiment,",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","in the judgment of many analysts.",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","would take some time after the recent things,",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","but I do think it would be quite positive over time.",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","You come back to the question of raising rates.",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","So that’s really about inflation.",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","we haven’t yet—we just touched 2 percent core inflation,",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","to pick one measure—just touched it for a few months,",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","So I think we would need to see a really significant move up in inflation that’s persistent before we would consider raising rates to address inflation concerns.",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","Well, I think we’re doing that.",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","I mean, I think we’re keeping—I think we’ve made very substantial adjustments to policy over the course of this year, if you think about it.",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","We entered the year expecting some further rate increases, we went to “patient,” now we’ve done three rate cuts.",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","It’s a very substantial shift, and the effects of it will be felt over time.",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","So we feel like those shifts are appropriate to support exactly the outcomes you’re talking about, which are a continuing strong labor market, continued strong job creation.",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","on the “how long,” what we’ve said is that we expect bill purchases to continue at least into the second quarter of next year.",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","And we’ve said that temporary open market operations we expect to continue,",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","at least until the end of January,",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","so there’s a lot of forensic work going on by us and by market participants and all kinds of analysts.",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","one thing is that we think we need reserves to be back up to the level—the minimum level of reserves that we can have during the various fluctuations that you see with reserves is something like $1.45 trillion or a little higher,",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","and that’s the level in early September.",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","So we’re going to be adding reserves to get back to that place.",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","There are also—it may be—one thing that was surprising about the episode was that liquidity didn’t seem to flow as one might have expected.",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","We had surveyed the banks carefully about what was their lowest comfortable level of reserves,",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","and many banks that were well above that level did not take that excess cash and invest it in the repo market at much higher rates.",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","They just—they didn’t do that, and so the question is why.",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","And are there things that we can do that would—adjustments that we could make that would allow liquidity to flow more easily in the system without in any way sacrificing safety and soundness or financial stability?",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","Those are not things that can happen that can really address the situation in the short term,",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","but those are a range of things that we’re looking at as well.",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","Honestly, it’s really the—there isn’t any one factor.",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","It’s really the whole range of economic data and also what we see as—about our stance of policy,",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","which we believe is the appropriate stance.",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","It’s really both of those things.",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","if you look at the performance of the economy through this,",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","the consumer sector has been quite resilient.",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","all the things I went through earlier suggest that that sector continues to be strong.",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","We know that the manufacturing, investment, trade, export sector has been weak.",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","we’ve got an economy that is showing moderate growth,",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","and we think that today’s setting—we’re now at 1.5 to 1.75 percent.",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","an accommodative level and a level that will support that outlook that we have.",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","You know, we don’t see any evidence of that.",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","What we see is—what we see is that the consumer sector continues strong.",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","It’s all—the data we monitor, obviously, is a very broad range of data.",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","more clearly the effects of more accommodative monetary policy on various kinds of consumer activity.",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","You’re seeing strong durable goods sales.",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","You’re seeing housing now contributing to growth for the first time in a while—two-tenths,",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","And you’re seeing retail sales—the retail home buying by keeping the labor market strong,",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","and keeping consumer confidence at high levels,",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","Well, I think monetary policy works through the channels that we understand.",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","I think the effects are clear in what we think of as the interest-rate-sensitive sectors,",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","which are the ones—some of the ones that I mentioned.",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","I think it’s—I think interest rates are a factor in business investment,",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","but I don’t believe they’re the main factor and main driver.",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","what one would like to see for—to support greater manufacturing activity,",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","and exports would be a global recovery.",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","there’s a lot of monetary policy accommodation and some fiscal accommodation,",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","Not here, but perhaps elsewhere.",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","And that should turn—that should support growth in the global economy.",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","And, again, resolution of our trade issues would contribute to that over time as well.",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","We think—we think that Fed Listens has been a great success for us,",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","and I’m sure we will repeat it.",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","I would imagine that this entire monetary policy review will become institutionalized and be done every few years.",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","we talk to educational institutions,",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","labor groups—it’s not just businesses.",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","all of those groups are also represented on the boards of our regional banks.",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","We also meet quite regularly at the Board with representatives of low- and moderate- income communities.",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","And so we’re—we’re very conscious of—you know,",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","that we represent all Americans,",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","and we need to hear all of their perspectives.",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","we talk about how low the unemployment rate is,",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","but we also talk about groups that haven’t experienced that yet.",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","And so we’re—we try to remind ourselves that we serve everybody.",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","So that is—our outlook overall is for moderate growth of around 2 percent, which is pretty close to trend.",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","That’s our outlook: could be better, could be worse.",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","You know, it’s—you never say you’ve achieved it.",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","And we feel like our current stance of policy is appropriate as long as that remains broadly our outlook.",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","today—can you tell us a little bit more about the rationale behind moving at this particular meeting as opposed to waiting six weeks and cutting in December, and if there was any discussion about that around the table?",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","I think this seems to be the right movement.",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","You can see that we had our usual range of perspectives, range of views.",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","But, in the end, we had a strong vote in favor of this action.",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","I strongly believe it’s the right action.",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","I strongly believe that the actions we’ve taken over the course of this year have been the right things to do for this economy and are supporting economic growth and will do so in the future.",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","You know, it’s—monetary policy is famously a blunt instrument.",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","So we can’t—obviously, we can’t raise interest rates some place and lower them other places.",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","The first thing to know is to understand that,",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","that—and we’ve called that out,",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","in one of our recent Monetary Policy Reports to Congress.",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","The sort of rural–urban disparities in—you know,",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","You know, it’s a big and growing difference—set of differences.",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","but we call things out that are important to our economy that we may not be—that we might have—may not have the right tools to best address national level and at the state level.",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","I’m not asking Congress to do anything right now.",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","I sometimes have noted that it would be appropriate.",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","Let me put it this way: We do what we do, which is, we’re assigned a job, which is maximum employment and stable prices.",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","Yes, I know, that’s—I wouldn’t—that’s not how I would characterize it.",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","I would just—I noted that it may be that there’s been progress there toward— that’s the case.",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","As with Brexit—it’s still quite uncertain what will be the result of the election and what the ultimate result will be.",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","But I would say that the tail risk of a nonnegotiated no-deal Brexit seems to have decreased, just as I would say that the situation in our trade negotiations with China seems to have taken a step closer to resolution.",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","That’s one factor among many, many factors that factor into our assessment of the outlook.",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","And if we see—if we have—if we—if things happen that cause us to materially reassess the outlook, change our assessment of the outlook in a material way, then we would act accordingly.",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","So, not for us to say what the appropriate labor arrangements will be.",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","it’s—it’s likely to have taken away a couple of tenths of growth this quarter.",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","That’s likely to come back, maybe, over the first half of next year.",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","And I think it’s good to see it settled.",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","But I’m not going to comment on what the appropriate labor arrangements are.",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","That’s a little bit far afield from our task here.",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","Wondering if you would categorize the current stance of monetary policy as accommodative,",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","that neutral was lower than we thought at this time last year.",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","we’re now two years removed from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act,",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","and the economy is growing at about the same pace it was before—2 percent.",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","given your mention of fiscal policy and the role it plays in supporting long-term growth,",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","is it fair to say that the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act worked the way it was supposed to?",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","Sorry, say again what your first question was?",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","So if you look at where the federal funds rate is trading,",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","it should be in the middle of,",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","So that means the real rate is probably modestly below zero.",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","I think my own sense would be that that’s somewhat accommodative policy.",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","that there’s a range of plausible estimates of what the neutral rate of interest is,",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","and I think many of those who make such estimates have moved their estimate down over the course of many years,",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","that seems to me to be very likely to be an accommodative stance of policy,",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","given the situation we’re in with continuing downside risks and—that I mentioned.",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","So we monitor financial stability risks very carefully all of the time.",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","It’s what we do since the financial crisis, as I’ve mentioned before.",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","Currently, we don’t see large imbalances.",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","This long expansion is notable for the lack of large financial imbalances like the ones we’ve seen certainly before the crisis happened.",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","So we have a four-part framework, I’ll quickly mention.",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","The first is leverage in the financial system, which is low by historical standards.",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","which is the risk of runnable funding,",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","and that risk is also quite low for banks but also for,",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","we see some high asset prices but not broadly across a range.",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","We don’t see bubbles and that kind of thing.",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","which is leverage in the nonfinancial sector,",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","and that’s households and businesses.",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","So with households, again, we don’t see leverage.",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","We see them actually getting in very good shape financially in the aggregate.",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","plenty of households are not in great shape financially,",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","the household sector is in a very good place.",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","That leaves businesses, which is where the issue has been.",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","Leverage among corporations and other forms of business, private businesses, is historically high.",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","We’ve been monitoring it carefully and taking appropriate steps.",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","but it’s—corporate debt is one part of a larger part of our framework,",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","and it is something that we’re paying quite a bit of attention to.",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","And it’s been part of the last couple of Shared National Credit exams,",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","and we’ve been monitoring it carefully and taking appropriate action.",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","requirements for banks are too high?",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","Is that something that the Fed might review?",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","I think the most important basic thing is to get the level of reserves back up so that—reserves move up and down with some volatility.",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","We don’t want them to move below the level they were at in the beginning of September,",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","between $1.45 and $1.5 trillion.",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","That’s the main thing, that’s the first thing.",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","And we’re on a path to do that,",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","between our temporary open market operations and also our bill purchases.",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","In addition to that—in addition to that,",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","we’re looking at—there are—it’s a big,",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","and there was the—one of the surprises,",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","was that banks that had told us that their lowest comfortable level of reserves was here.",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","and yet they didn’t deploy that liquidity when there seemed to be great opportunities to do that.",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","And so, we’re doing careful analysis of that.",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","You ask, would we lower capital and liquidity requirements because of this?",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","I don’t think that’s where this goes.",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","which used to be a common thing.",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","It used to be a common thing for banks to have intraday liquidity from the Fed,",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","what are called “daylight overdrafts.” That’s something we can look at.",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","there are just a few technical things that we can look at that would perhaps make the liquidity that we have—which we think is ample in the financial system—move more freely and be more liquid,",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","And those are things we would do,",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","but only if we can do it without compromising safety or soundness or financial stability.",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","have watched the situation in Japan and now the situation in Europe,",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","and we—we note that there are significant disinflationary pressures around the world.",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","And we don’t think we’re exempt from those.",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","if you look at our current inflation performance,",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","it hasn’t been anything like what we’ve seen in those other places.",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","we don’t think we’re exempt from those pressures,",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","strongly committed to having inflation expectations anchored at the level that is consistent with the symmetric 2 percent inflation objective.",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","That’s what we’re committed to, and we’ll use our tools to achieve.",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","So we take—we take the risk very seriously.",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","It’s not—the risk isn’t that inflation might run a couple tenths below 2 percent.",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","The risk is that what we’ve seen is other economies getting on a disinflationary path,",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","that it’s been very hard for them to get off.",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","Once inflation expectations start sliding down, inflation moves down.",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","You have less—interest rates move down as well,",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","because there’s an inflation component in interest rates.",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","we think that the right thing to do is to do what we can now to hold and really move inflation expectations up so that they’re squarely and firmly anchored at a level that’s consistent with 2 percent inflation.",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","You know, it’s a—it’s an issue, but it’s not an issue that we’re currently working on and—or reaching a decision on or anything like that.",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","The question of the longer-run maturity composition of the balance sheet is a—is a big one, and it’s one we’ll return to over time, but not—not imminently.",""
"2019-10-30","Q&A","You know, I’m going to maintain my longtime practice of not—not commenting on anything any elected official would say, but thank you.",""
"2019-12-11","Opening Statement","I’d like to say a few words about Paul Volcker,",""

"2019-12-11","Opening Statement","thus laying the foundation for the prosperity and price stability we enjoy today.",""
"2019-12-11","Opening Statement","But what is perhaps most admirable about him— more than his many accomplishments—was his character.",""
"2019-12-11","Opening Statement","He believed that there is no higher calling than public service,",""

"2019-12-11","Q&A","when there was—when labor markets were tight and unemployment was low,",""

"2019-12-11","Q&A","the connection got weaker and weaker and weaker,",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","to the point where there’s still a connection,",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","but it’s—it’s a very faint one.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","And I—what that suggests is that you 1 Chair Powell intended to say the repurchase operations were announced in October.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","You know, I don’t think that’s right.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","the relationship between slack in the economy and inflation is weak,",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","The coefficient is something like 0.1.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","much lower than it used to be,",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","but I don’t know that it’s gone down any more in the last decade.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","If you look—look at where wages were three or four years ago,",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","they were running around 2 percent.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","And now the whole group of different wage measures that we monitor has moved up to 3 and 3½ percent,",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","the relationship between—in a way,",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","the wage Phillips curve has a higher coefficient than the price Phillips curve does.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","But we do still see some relationship, and that’s what you’re seeing in those numbers.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","between the two instances during that long expansion,",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","when the Fed cut three times only to resume raising rates.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","And the notion just is that it’s a—the economy needed slightly more accommodative policy,",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","but it wasn’t the end of the expansion,",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","And that’s the same situation we believe we’re in here.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","So this is that we did, in fact, turn out to do three rate cuts.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","in any kind of specific way at the beginning.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","you have a very different—you have very different structural characteristics in the economy,",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","inflation is barely moving up,",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","notwithstanding that unemployment is at 50-year lows and expected to remain there.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","So the need for rate increases is less.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","this is—it’s a good thing that,",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","we think we can—I think we’ve learned that unemployment can remain at quite low levels for an extended period of time without unwanted upward pressure on inflation.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","In fact, we need some upward pressure on inflation to get back to 2 percent.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","It’s quite different in ’95 and ’98 when there were those two adjustments.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","So, I would say, similarities and differences.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","So I’m going to take a little step back,",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","and I will—I will get to your specific questions on the year-end and on T-bills.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","So I guess I want to start by stressing that these are very important operational matters but that are not likely to have any macroeconomic implications.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","We’d decided back in January to remain an ample-reserves regime,",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","and that means we will be setting the federal funds rate—the range for the federal funds rate through our administered rates and not through active management of the level of reserves.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","We’re committed to robustly implementing that framework, as you can see by our actions.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","is to assure that our monetary policy decisions will be transmitted to the federal funds rate,",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","which in turn affects other short-term rates.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","We have the tools to accomplish that, and we will use them.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","The purpose of all this is not to eliminate all volatility,",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","particularly in the repo market.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","we had very gradually allowed the balance sheet to shrink,",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","we slowed that gradual pace by half in March,",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","we had surveyed all of the banks,",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","and particularly the large banks who hold a lot of the reserves,",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","“What’s your lowest comfortable level of reserves?” We got those numbers,",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","and it came out sort of at a level that was well below where we were in September.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","in September that reserves—the markets acted as though reserves had become scarce.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","So what had happened was that liquidity,",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","didn’t flow into the repo market,",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","and that had effects on the federal funds rate.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","So the question is, why did that happen?",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","raised—we’re looking carefully at those.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","We’re open to ideas for modifying supervisory and regulatory practice in ways that don’t undermine safety and soundness,",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","and a number of ideas are under—under examination there.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","To go through it sort of by—in time,",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","on September 17 with overnight operations.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","By October 11 we had created and put into effect a plan.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","for the last couple of months,",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","repo markets have been functioning well,",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","Temporary upward pressures on short-term money market rates are not unusual around year-end.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","And our—both our repo operations and Treasury bill purchases are intended to mitigate the risks that such pressures pose to our control of the federal funds rate.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","We think that the pressures appear manageable,",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","and we stand ready to adjust the details of our operations as necessary to keep the federal funds rate in the target range.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","the key to our strategy is to supply reserves in the near term through—through both overnight and term repo,",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","we’re raising the underlying level of reserves through bill purchases.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","We’ve also said that we were willing to adapt our strategy.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","but if it does become appropriate for us to purchase other short- term coupon securities,",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","then we would be prepared to do that if—if the need arises.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","So—but we don’t—we don’t—we’re not in that place.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","It looks—it very much looks like the bill—so those bill purchases are going well,",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","the other thing I’ll say is that we’re in,",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","very regular contact with market participants all the time.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","on the standing repo facility,",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","we’ve actually had a couple of meetings where we’ve discussed that.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","I think the standing repo facility is something that’ll take some time to evaluate and create the parameters of and put into place.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","At the moment what we’re focused on is, you know—we’re now focused on year-end.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","I should also mention that after the year-end,",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","the sense of it is that as the underlying level of reserves moves up because of bill purchases,",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","there will come a time when it will be appropriate for overnight and term repo to gradually decline.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","We don’t know—we can’t know today what the timing of that will be,",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","but that’s the way—that’s the way we see it going over time.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","Well, as I mentioned, actually, at the last press conference, we think our policy rate is appropriate and will remain appropriate as long as incoming data are broadly in keeping with our—with our outlook.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","And in order to move rates up, I would want to see inflation that’s persistent and that’s significant—a significant move-up in inflation that’s also persistent before raising rates to address inflation concerns.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","I think what you’re seeing is,",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","you’ve got a full year of the median being flat,",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","and inflation not moving up very much,",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","And that underscores, I think, the challenge of getting inflation to move up.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","The Committee has wanted inflation to be at 2 percent,",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","for—ever since I arrived in 2012.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","and it’s just—it’s because there are disinflationary forces around the world,",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","and they’ve been stronger than,",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","In terms of those out-year rate increases,",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","what’s you’re—you’re looking at rate increases more than a year into the future,",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","people will have their own explanations for why they do that,",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","none of us have much of a sense of what the economy will be like in 2021.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","So I think what may be behind some of that is just the thought that,",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","it would be appropriate—if you believe that the neutral rate is 2½ percent,",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","it would be appropriate for your rates to move up in that direction.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","I will also say to you that a number of people wrote down,",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","and you can’t see this at this level of detail,",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","but—today—but a number of people did write down overshoots of inflation as appropriate—under appropriate policy.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","increased over the past year as you’ve been dropping the policy rate,",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","what is it that gives you confidence that the Fed has the tools to get inflation back up to target or even overshoot as you just indicated that some people are considering doing?",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","it’s just that there is still,",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","many different—by the work of many different analysts,",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","there is a relationship between resource utilization,",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","And, by the way, that’s not a bad thing.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","That means that we can run at low levels of unemployment and have a historically good—in some dimensions—labor market without having to worry about inflation.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","It also means, though, that it’s not easy to move inflation up.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","Now, you say, why is there confidence?",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","I would say there’s more humility than there is confidence in this at this point.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","It’s been very challenging to get inflation to be at target.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","has been closest to it but still hasn’t quite been able to achieve it.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","And I would also point out that this year,",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","which has been a good year for the economy,",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","inflation—core inflation is actually running at 1.6 percent,",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","whereas it ran close to 2 percent most of last year.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","So it’s—it’s a real challenge,",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","and—but I think we’re using our tools as best we can to meet that challenge.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","I think the answer to the question of whether saying it is enough to create credibility,",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","the answer to that is “no.” And I think you have to back that up with policy that supports the outcome,",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","and that’s what we’re trying to do.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","And so the— the changes that we’re looking at to the framework are—I think they take all of that on board,",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","and—but they’re—what they’re—what they are designed to do is to strengthen the credibility of that—of that inflation target,",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","but only if followed by policy.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","it will take time to establish—to move inflation expectations up from where they are,",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","which appears to be a bit below 2 percent,",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","It’ll have to happen over time as credibility is built.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","the Fed has great inflation credibility,",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","but inflation expectations are anchored at about their 25-year average,",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","which is a few ticks below 2 percent.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","I did see the news today that it appears there’s an agreement to move forward to vote on USMCA,",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","it’s not our role to comment on particular trade policies or criticize them one way or the other or evaluate them.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","that getting—if the deal were to be enacted,",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","then it would certainly remove some of the trade policy We’ve been hearing from our people that we talked to—the many,",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","many people and businesses that we talked to in—through the Reserve Banks that wind up being written up in the Beige Book,",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","and they’ve been telling us all year—for a year and a half,",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","that trade policy uncertainty is weighing on the outlook.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","without commenting on it— in any way on the process or the content of the agreement,",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","I think that uncertainty—removal of uncertainty around that would be a positive for the economy as well.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","Well, I think you can—you know, it’s—I think you can see that what’s been moving—one way to look at it is, what’s been moving financial markets?",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","It’s been news about the negotiations with China, not so much",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","the focus really is on how to use our strategies,",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","and communications to achieve both sides of the mandate.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","And you’re right, though, that we’ve talked here a lot about inflation.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","over a period of years—many years—we’ve been learning that the natural rate of unemployment is lower.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","It’s just been—it’s in estimates not just at the Fed,",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","but among—broadly among economists—labor economists have seen that the connection—that we can sustain much lower levels of unemployment than had been thought.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","that’s a good thing because that means we—we don’t have to worry so much about inflation.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","And that’s—and you see the benefits of that in today’s labor market.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","the Fed Listens events are about inflation to a much lesser extent than they are about maximum employment.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","If you’ve—if you’ve listened to or attended any of those,",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","the discussion—we always focus on inflation as well,",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","but the discussion is really around what’s happening in low- and moderate-income communities and among small businesses.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","And I think you—you get a perspective,",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","we were already getting that from our extensive outreach to community groups and such.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","But it was help to get—helpful to get it in the context of a monetary policy review.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","And I think that the fact that these communities have so much— such high levels of unemployment and low levels of labor force participation tells you that there is slack out there.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","And I think that does also inform our understanding of what we mean by “maximum employment.” And it’s been a very positive—I would say that the Fed Listens events have been—have been extraordinarily positive,",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","and they’re certainly something we’ll repeat.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","You also see from environments,",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","training is moving up—you hear just a lot—there are a lot of things going on that suggest that people at the margins of the labor force are being pulled in and being given chances,",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","I—I think we have kind of internalized—and this isn’t— this isn’t news for today,",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","this is something we’ve been saying for,",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","for several years— you’ve seen us moving down our estimates of the—of maximum employment.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","that—that there’s more—even though we’re at 3½ percent unemployment,",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","there’s actually more slack out there,",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","to explore that are relatively low.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","and I think the review certainly underscores that,",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","but that’s—that’s a very important insight.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","So, on Treasuries versus reserves, we’ve done a ton of work on that.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","they’re all over the place on the composition of their—of their buffer.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","So you have to have—you have a business model,",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","and that business model suggests what your stress outflows will be,",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","and that suggests what your buffer should be.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","And you see them making quite different choices.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","Some of them have lots of reserves and,",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","and then they change their mind and they switch,",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","so it’s not obvious that there’s one thing happening there.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","Notwithstanding that, we have—we’ve gone out to try to understand that, talking to supervisors.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","we have not tried to pull the TGA into this yet;",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","I don’t know that at some point we won’t have those discussions,",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","Treasury—we want Treasury to be able to have the cash that it needs.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","And then we should—we are essentially taking that as exogenous to our—to our work.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","there may come a time when we—when we talk about that,",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","but we haven’t done much of that.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","Standing repo facility—so your question on that is, what are we thinking about it?",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","I—so I think we’re—we are more focused,",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","and also the review of supervisory and regulatory issues that we’re digging into,",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","there’s—these are structural things—right?— where you could,",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","without sacrificing safety and soundness,",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","just allow the—allow the liquidity that is already there to flow more freely,",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","perhaps by making fairly straightforward,",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","And we think there is some of that, though—and so we’re working hard and fast.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","the—if they take rule changes,",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","you year-end with the overnight facilities and the bill purchases and the term repo—those are—those are things we have to do right now and are doing.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","actually—if you look at the statement,",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","you’ll notice that we—we did call out global developments and muted inflation pressures later in the statement.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","You know, those are the things that we’ve been monitoring all year.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","We’ve put now in place policies that we think are appropriate to address those things,",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","But those are—those are just key things,",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","so we thought it was appropriate to mention them there—still subject to the idea that,",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","we would want to see a material reassessment of the outlook.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","one thing that we’re mindful of is that we’ve cut rates three times since July.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","That’s 75 basis points’ worth of cuts.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","And we do believe that monetary back and—and wait.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","And we thought—I think we took strong measures.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","if you look at—more broadly at the Treasury yield curve,",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","it has moved more than 75 basis points.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","So you’ve—you’ve had quite a significant move in the direction of higher accommodation.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","what is material at the end of the day,",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","whether or not a change in the outlook merits a policy response will be a collective judgment of the",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","So I—this wouldn’t be a—my response will not be about Paul Volcker,",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","you started with Paul Volcker.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","if you look back at 2018—I’ll just take you back to the beginning of 2018.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","We had an economy growing at 3 percent,",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","we had inflation at 2 percent,",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","and we had a trillion and a half dollars’ worth of stimulus arriving,",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","and the federal funds rate was 1.4 percent.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","So it wasn’t that—so we moved—we moved policy up during the course of the year.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","We never got policy even at the level of what we thought the neutral rate was at the time.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","So there was no sense of it being restrictive.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","We took steps to make it less accommodative,",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","and that seemed to be the right thing.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","It still seems to me to be the right thing in hindsight.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","The idea that we were trying to, you know, slow the economy down—we rate was.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","So policy was always accommodative during the course of that year.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","I think what’s happened is, the—obviously, the facts on the ground have changed.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","You saw the global economic slowdown begin in the middle of last year,",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","and then continue to go on this year,",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","so you’ve seen a continual weakening.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","Just look at the IMF’s forecasts of growth from,",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","the spring of 2018 and compare them to now.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","You’ve had quite a significant—that does affect us.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","the trade situation was just beginning in the middle of ’18,",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","and I think it had—has had—you know,",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","very wide range of estimates of the effect,",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","but I think it’s had a meaningful effect on output just through the uncertainty channel and,",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","And, again, that’s not to make a judgment.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","It’s not up to us to make a judgment about that.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","So, that’s what—that would be my story.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","You know, I wouldn’t want to speculate on—on a hypothetical.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","I would say—we’ll just have to see.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","We’re—we look at a range of factors and we’ve—as I’ve said before, we try to look through the volatility in trade news and trade negotiations.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","Monetary policy is not the right tool to react in the very short term to volatility and, you know, things that can change back and forth and back and forth as this has",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","You know, I—I’m going to stick with my and my predecessors’ longtime practice of not discussing private meetings with elected officials—or other officials, really.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","We don’t consider things like that.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","With—I think properly understood, it can be useful, but that’s been a challenge.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","I think “properly understood” to me means looking at what it is and not at what it isn’t.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","it’s an expression of the thinking about individual Committee members about appropriate monetary policy and the path of the economy.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","Remember that we write all that down,",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","But we don’t discuss it at the meeting, and we don’t negotiate a plan.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","There is no—there’s no agreement.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","And when the economic outlook is changing, the dots are—they’re just not a consideration.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","We’re going to do what we think is the right thing for the economy.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","And if the fact—dots that we did six months ago or three months ago don’t agree with that,",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","that’s not even in the conversation.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","So its more—but it can it be useful if—and I think—but,",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","and so I—I do—I do like to say,",""

"2019-12-11","Q&A","you can—you can miss the broader picture.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","So let me say, we’re—we’ve been working on this all year.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","And we’re just at the stage where we’ve had a really interesting discussion about the various tools that we have at the October meeting.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","we talked about the way monetary policy affects different groups in the economy.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","So we had a—we talked about the Fed Listens events and some very interesting research.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","So we’re just getting to the stage where we’re looking at conclusions.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","You know, what do we take away from all this?",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","And those things— many of those things would wind up as changes,",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","modifications to the “Statement of Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy.” I think that process will take until the middle be able to—to reach a successful conclusion and make meaningful improvements.",""

"2019-12-11","Q&A","You know—and if you define going anywhere as a 4 percent inflation target—let me talk about the 4 percent inflation target.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","So I’ll go back to the point that just saying words is not itself credible.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","“We’re raising the inflation target to 4,” what would be the effect of that?",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","I mean, where’s the credibility in that, really?",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","You haven’t been able to get it to 2.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","So I think we—I think you need to lower your sights a little bit.",""

"2019-12-11","Q&A","Is that really price stability?",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","Is that within our legal mandate?",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","I mean, I think it’s a fair question.",""

"2019-12-11","Q&A","again and again and things like that,",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","then we can—at least we’re moving in a good direction.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","Well, you know, I have to say, my total focus is on right now and getting policy right and thinking about next year—you know, thinking about what’s the economy mean, it’s too long of a question.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","You know, I don’t know how to get after that.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","There’s— there’s a lot of learning that comes into—from the economy every year and in the way we do our jobs.",""

"2019-12-11","Q&A","didn’t see and I don’t think anybody saw coming the—the challenges that we faced this year.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","there was still a sense the economy was growing at around 3 percent.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","And I didn’t expect the—to face the challenges,",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","and I think we—I’m pleased that we moved to support the economy in the way that we did.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","I think our moves will prove appropriate.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","I think both the economy and monetary policy right now,",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","Well, wage gains have moved up a bit.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","If you look back three, four years, you’ll see wages are growing around 2 percent.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","Now you see them moving up, you know, more at 3, 3½ percent.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","So why aren’t they growing higher, at a faster rate?",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","I think there are a range of explanations.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","For instance, one would be that productivity has just been low.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","So wages should go up to cover inflation and productivity.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","Productivity has been low, and that—that is very likely to be holding back wages.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","I also think there are other think that hangs over the wage-setting process—and everywhere,",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","You don’t see— there isn’t the kind of traction in the wage market that—even in a tight labor market.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","that the labor market may not be as tight as we had thought it was.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","And, you know, I think there—there are many, many possible explanations.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","at nonsupervisory employees in the labor report,",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","there are— their wages are going up at 3.7 percent.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","you do see—and wages are going up the most for people at the lower end of the—that’s been true for the last couple of years—lower end of the wage spectrum.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","So you do see wages moving up.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","It’s just—they’re not moving up at—at very high rates.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","that probably has most to do with productivity.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","And I would also say that we—if you ask people,",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","what do you think the natural rate of unemployment is?",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","People were writing down numbers in the fives,",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","and then they were writing down numbers in the fours.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","unemployment has been in the threes for a year and a half,",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","and we still see wage inflation,",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","The level of wage inflation has actually moved down,",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","there may be compositional effects in that number that may—that may be,",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","about younger workers coming in at lower wages that—than retiring workers.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","But you wouldn’t—that shouldn’t have much of an effect, actually.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","It may just be that there’s more slack in the economy.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","And I think we are seeing that.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","We’re prime-age participation moving up pretty steadily over the last two or three years.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","And it’s a very positive thing,",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","but it does sort of provide more labor supply,",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","meaning a less tight labor market.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","we think the CRA—we know the CRA is a very important law,",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","and we’re strongly committed to the mission of ensuring that banks provide credit to their—throughout their communities,",""

"2019-12-11","Q&A","sort of tension between the regimes if they do turn out to be slightly different regimes.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","So that’s something we—I hope we don’t have to face,",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","we—there’s so many other measures that suggest that the labor market is—I like to say the labor market is strong.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","I don’t really want to say that it’s tight.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","Someone asked me a question about a hot labor market—that was in the Humphrey-Hawkins hearings.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","So I’ll say that the labor market is strong.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","I don’t know that it’s tight, because you’re not seeing wage increases, you know.",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","those should be—should be reflected in higher wage increases,",""
"2019-12-11","Q&A","we look at countless measures of labor market—you know,",""

"2020-01-29","Full Text","I will just tell you that, of course, we are very carefully monitoring the situation.",""
"2020-01-29","Full Text","what are the potential ramifications for the",""
"2020-01-29","Full Text","So our stated goal is to keep IOER and the federal funds rate well within the range.",""
"2020-01-29","Full Text","And that, clearly, you know—5 basis points from the bottom or from the top isn’t that.",""
"2020-01-29","Full Text","So that’s why we moved back up.",""
"2020-01-29","Full Text","Last year we were—we saw some tightness as reserves were draining out of the system.",""
"2020-01-29","Full Text","So now we’re—now we are well within the range, I would say.",""

"2020-01-29","Full Text","there may well be a role for repo in this system even after we’re at an ample- reserves level.",""

"2020-01-29","Full Text","we have not decided—we haven’t at all made a decision on a standing repo facility.",""

"2020-01-29","Full Text","We’re going to return, I would say, fairly soon to this question.",""

"2020-01-29","Full Text","We don’t have any urgency in making that decision,",""
"2020-01-29","Full Text","because we’re still trying to find that sort of stable equilibrium where we’re in an ample-reserves regime.",""
"2020-01-29","Full Text","that you think severe weather events are happening more often and that the Fed is monitoring what that could physically do to a bank or a financial institution,",""

"2020-01-29","Full Text","Do you think there’s a systemwide risk that may—that could develop from climate change?",""
"2020-01-29","Full Text","So that’s an interesting question—the question being, is there a systemwide financial stability risk?",""
"2020-01-29","Full Text","and I would say that sort of feeds into the way we’re thinking about climate change as an institution.",""
"2020-01-29","Full Text","climate change is an important issue,",""
"2020-01-29","Full Text","but it’s essentially assigned to many other agencies in the federal government and state governments for leadership on that.",""
"2020-01-29","Full Text","society’s overall response to climate change needs to be decided by elected officials and not by the Fed.",""
"2020-01-29","Full Text","we’ve got a monetary policy mandate and,",""
"2020-01-29","Full Text","a supervisory mandate where we’re supervising financial markets,",""
"2020-01-29","Full Text","And we haven’t—we share overall responsibility for financial stability with a number of agencies.",""
"2020-01-29","Full Text","And that latter part—I think the public has every right to expect and will expect that we will assure that the financial system is resilient and robust against the risks from climate change.",""
"2020-01-29","Full Text","Now, I think that’s got to be right.",""
"2020-01-29","Full Text","We are in the very early stages,",""
"2020-01-29","Full Text","in understanding just what that means.",""
"2020-01-29","Full Text","And there’s quite a lot of work going on around the world at other central banks and at the Fed,",""
"2020-01-29","Full Text","But I do think it’s—in that sense,",""
"2020-01-29","Full Text","it has to be part of our role,",""
"2020-01-29","Full Text","and—but not the overall response of society to climate change.",""
"2020-01-29","Full Text","So we’ve attended all of their meetings and taken part in them, and we’ve been looking at joining in one form or another and talking to them about that.",""
"2020-01-29","Full Text","We probably will do that at some point.",""
"2020-01-29","Full Text","So that’s—that’s an ongoing question.",""
"2020-01-29","Full Text","But we’re very much attending those meetings and taking part in them.",""
"2020-01-29","Full Text","So I guess I’d start by saying that the fact that we’ve reached a phase-one deal with China and the fact that we’ve moved ahead closer to getting USM[C]A agreed—those are potentially positive things for the economy without question.",""
"2020-01-29","Full Text","And financial markets—the reaction of financial markets is very consistent with that perception.",""
"2020-01-29","Full Text","A sustained reduction in uncertainty over time should improve business sentiment,",""
"2020-01-29","Full Text","which would provide some additional support for the economy.",""
"2020-01-29","Full Text","It’s important, though, to bear in mind a couple of things.",""
"2020-01-29","Full Text","First, trade policy uncertainty remains elevated.",""
"2020-01-29","Full Text","Businesses continue to identify it as an ongoing risk.",""
"2020-01-29","Full Text","We still have two or even three active trade discussions that are going on in the public square right now.",""
"2020-01-29","Full Text","and we’ve just come through a round of talking to our vast network of comments— sorry,",""
"2020-01-29","Full Text","contacts in the business world.",""
"2020-01-29","Full Text","these are seen as positive developments going forward,",""
"2020-01-29","Full Text","but there’s a bit of a wait-and-see attitude—is this going to be There’s also the global economy.",""
"2020-01-29","Full Text","You could—you could well see manufacturing—as I mentioned,",""
"2020-01-29","Full Text","manufacturing PMIs have started to tick up consistently among both advanced economies and emerging market economies.",""
"2020-01-29","Full Text","We do not see a decisive recovery,",""
"2020-01-29","Full Text","but it’s possible that this mix of positive developments and also accommodative financial conditions could spur further growth.",""
"2020-01-29","Full Text","serious review of that question and look at both our regulations and also supervisory practices.",""
"2020-01-29","Full Text","And we’d be prepared to adjust those in ways that might encourage liquidity to flow more easily in the system as long as it didn’t undermine safety and soundness.",""
"2020-01-29","Full Text","And so we’ve undertaken that, and we’ve done a ton of work, actually.",""
"2020-01-29","Full Text","We don’t have anything to announce here today,",""
"2020-01-29","Full Text","but I feel good about the—what we’ve learned there.",""
"2020-01-29","Full Text","I think—you mentioned other factors.",""
"2020-01-29","Full Text","We will be announcing our findings.",""
"2020-01-29","Full Text","I’m not going to give you a time,",""
"2020-01-29","Full Text","but we’re— we’re well along in that assessment at this time.",""
"2020-01-29","Full Text","that the level of reserves that we need in the system to conduct our operations without frequent resort to open market operations was higher than we had thought and was higher than others had thought,",""
"2020-01-29","Full Text","We learned that we can’t let reserves—we will be substantially higher than $1½ [trillion],",""
"2020-01-29","Full Text","So $1½ [trillion] is not a target level.",""
"2020-01-29","Full Text","It is the bottom of a range in which reserves will be expected to move.",""
"2020-01-29","Full Text","let me just stress that we have a very specific and important reason for caring about money market operations generally,",""
"2020-01-29","Full Text","and that just is that we are—our monetary policy decisions are transmitted through the financial markets—through the money markets into other financial markets and into broader financial conditions.",""
"2020-01-29","Full Text","So we care that money markets are operating smoothly.",""
"2020-01-29","Full Text","And they stopped operating smoothly, briefly, back in September.",""
"2020-01-29","Full Text","This is a one-time thing that we’re doing to adjust the level of reserves so that the money markets will be able to operate smoothly on an ongoing basis.",""
"2020-01-29","Full Text","because that’s where Treasury securities—the purchase of Treasury securities,",""
"2020-01-29","Full Text","the federal—part of the way the federal government is funding its operations.",""
"2020-01-29","Full Text","It’s the way those are financed.",""
"2020-01-29","Full Text","So these are largely Treasury securities that have been purchased by dealers to—for distribution to—and buyers,",""
"2020-01-29","Full Text","That’s what’s going on in the Treasury repo market.",""
"2020-01-29","Full Text","So it’s just the financing volatility in the repo market can affect the transmission of—of our policy decisions to federal funds rate,",""
"2020-01-29","Full Text","and that really is important for the public.",""
"2020-01-29","Full Text","So we will be looking tomorrow and voting on a—a new part of—part of the existing Volcker rule,",""
"2020-01-29","Full Text","and that is the covered fund provisions of the rule.",""
"2020-01-29","Full Text","And we’ll be making a bunch of proposed revisions that we believe are faithful to both the letter and the spirit of the law.",""
"2020-01-29","Full Text","We’re going to put those proposals out for public discussion,",""

"2020-01-29","Full Text","we believe that they will be—and you’ll see them tomorrow—will be public—you know,",""
"2020-01-29","Full Text","will be publicly—we have a Board meeting tomorrow to do that.",""

"2020-01-29","Full Text","And a couple of years ago the authorities decided to try to get that under control—to stop the growth and to control it.",""

"2020-01-29","Full Text","We’re trying to raise the level of reserves back up to a level so that banks can meet their reserve requirements,",""
"2020-01-29","Full Text","and that there’s enough reserves in the system that we don’t see reserve scarcity,",""
"2020-01-29","Full Text","and we don’t have to use repo operations to provide additional reserves.",""
"2020-01-29","Full Text","we believe we can get to that state at the current pace sometime in the second quarter.",""

"2020-01-29","Full Text","to do that in order to enable better transmission of our—of our rate decisions into the economy under our chosen framework.",""
"2020-01-29","Full Text","That’s really the purpose of what we’re doing.",""
"2020-01-29","Full Text","Well, as you know, we’re comfortable with our current policy stance.",""
"2020-01-29","Full Text","We think it’ll remain appropriate as long as data coming in are broadly in keeping with our outlook.",""
"2020-01-29","Full Text","Over time—over time, though—let me take a step back.",""
"2020-01-29","Full Text","an average inflation-targeting framework would be different than our current framework,",""
"2020-01-29","Full Text","in the sense that it wouldn’t be a—there would be some aspect of trying to make inflation average 2 percent over time,",""
"2020-01-29","Full Text","if it runs below 2 percent for a time,",""
"2020-01-29","Full Text","it has to run above to bring the average up.",""

"2020-01-29","Full Text","that would— consistent with that would be having all the deviations be on one side,",""

"2020-01-29","Full Text","And when we look at financial conditions,",""
"2020-01-29","Full Text","what matters for the real economy is substantial changes in—or,",""
"2020-01-29","Full Text","material changes in financial conditions that are sustained over a period of time.",""
"2020-01-29","Full Text","maybe I’ll—maybe I’ll answer that in the context of our overall financial stability framework.",""
"2020-01-29","Full Text","So we look at—when we look at financial stability,",""
"2020-01-29","Full Text","we’ve got four pillars to that,",""
"2020-01-29","Full Text","the first of which is leverage in the financial system that is at a comfortable level.",""
"2020-01-29","Full Text","Our banks, particularly our large banks, have high levels of capital.",""
"2020-01-29","Full Text","The second is leverage in the nonfinancial sector, and that divides into households and businesses.",""
"2020-01-29","Full Text","Households’ debt to GDP is—has been coming down since the financial crisis.",""
"2020-01-29","Full Text","It’s at low—low levels compared to what it was before the crisis.",""
"2020-01-29","Full Text","household debt is in a good place,",""
"2020-01-29","Full Text","Business debt has been moving up.",""
"2020-01-29","Full Text","We’ve been calling that out for more than a year—substantially more than a year,",""
"2020-01-29","Full Text","and it’s something we’re focused on.",""
"2020-01-29","Full Text","And we’ve taken appropriate measures and are monitoring carefully.",""
"2020-01-29","Full Text","But we think it’s not something that would threaten financial stability,",""
"2020-01-29","Full Text","you look at risk spreads, they’re narrow.",""
"2020-01-29","Full Text","If you look at P/Es, they’re high.",""
"2020-01-29","Full Text","I think the way to think about—a good way—one way to think about equity prices,",""
"2020-01-29","Full Text","what’s the premium you’re getting paid to own equities rather than risk-free debt?",""
"2020-01-29","Full Text","And that’s also at fairly low levels, but not extremely low levels.",""
"2020-01-29","Full Text","So valuations are high, but not at extremes.",""
"2020-01-29","Full Text","The final factor is funding risk.",""
"2020-01-29","Full Text","Are big financial institutions and other players in the financial system funded with stable funding,",""
"2020-01-29","Full Text","or is there a lot of run risk?",""
"2020-01-29","Full Text","And the answer is, very stable funding, for the most part.",""
"2020-01-29","Full Text","vulnerabilities to the financial—to financial stability are moderate overall.",""
"2020-01-29","Full Text","do you support Governor Brainard’s vision for the Community Reinvestment Act reform?",""
"2020-01-29","Full Text","And is this something that we could see the Fed formally propose at some point?",""
"2020-01-29","Full Text","So let me say that I think this is a good time to do—to update CRA,",""
"2020-01-29","Full Text","in a way that is a win–win both for the intended beneficiaries—low- and moderate- income communities—and also for banks that would like to have more certainty about—about what does and doesn’t qualify and that sort of thing.",""
"2020-01-29","Full Text","The law can both be more effective and more efficient is—it comes down to.",""
"2020-01-29","Full Text","And we think this is a good way.",""
"2020-01-29","Full Text","It’s also just a good time to take on board the way the delivery of banking services has changed through technology and demographic change as well.",""
"2020-01-29","Full Text","We worked very hard to try to get on the same page with the other two agencies.",""
"2020-01-29","Full Text","We think that an interagency final rule together would be the best outcome.",""

"2020-01-29","Full Text","and we still hold out some hope that we will be able to.",""
"2020-01-29","Full Text","We spent a lot of decisions about what we’re going to do,",""
"2020-01-29","Full Text","about whether we’ll propose—I mean,",""
"2020-01-29","Full Text","our focus has been entirely on trying to get to agreement with the OCC,",""
"2020-01-29","Full Text","So we haven’t made any decisions about what we’re going to do going forward.",""
"2020-01-29","Full Text","you know—Governor Brainard led our oversight committee over these activities for many years,",""
"2020-01-29","Full Text","and I asked her to take the lead on CRA modernization,",""
"2020-01-29","Full Text","which is a high priority for us.",""
"2020-01-29","Full Text","I was comfortable with her speech,",""
"2020-01-29","Full Text","and I’m comfortable with the work we’ve done and with the Fed’s position on this.",""
"2020-01-29","Full Text","As I said, we haven’t chosen to bring a proposal forward.",""
"2020-01-29","Full Text","We haven’t decided what to do, whether—going forward.",""

"2020-01-29","Full Text","It’s just not appropriate to do.",""
"2020-01-29","Full Text","It’s about the views of the interested parties.",""

"2020-01-29","Full Text","I also think it’s a good thing that we would have brighter lines to define our LISCC supervisory portfolio,",""
"2020-01-29","Full Text","which we haven’t really had to date.",""
"2020-01-29","Full Text","Remember that when a firm moves from one portfolio to another,",""
"2020-01-29","Full Text","that doesn’t mean that its level of scrutiny or supervision will change.",""
"2020-01-29","Full Text","how to—how to balance the desire for transparency and due process in everything the government does with the needs of confidential supervision.",""
"2020-01-29","Full Text","It’s a very challenging question.",""
"2020-01-29","Full Text","It’s one that could use further thought.",""
"2020-01-29","Full Text","and need further development and will need lots of comment and that sort of thing.",""
"2020-01-29","Full Text","So we—we are assigned a job by Congress,",""
"2020-01-29","Full Text","and that is to use our tools to pursue maximum employment and stable prices.",""
"2020-01-29","Full Text","And that’s what—that’s our focus.",""
"2020-01-29","Full Text","Now, monetary policy is a blunt instrument, but it’s a powerful one.",""
"2020-01-29","Full Text","So I think if you look— look at the time since the financial crisis.",""
"2020-01-29","Full Text","That was—in the week [wake] of fairly modest growth,",""
"2020-01-29","Full Text","it was a powerful recovery in the labor market.",""

"2020-03-15","Q&A","I think—what our tools can accomplish,",""
"2020-03-15","Q&A","and—and really what they’re not designed to accomplish.",""
"2020-03-15","Q&A","So what our liquidity operations—and I’ll talk specifically about the Treasury and MBS purchases—are designed to do is to assure the proper functioning of the Treasury and MBS markets.",""
"2020-03-15","Q&A","The Treasury market is one of the most important,",""
"2020-03-15","Q&A","It’s probably the most liquid large market in the world.",""
"2020-03-15","Q&A","The MBS market is very important:",""
"2020-03-15","Q&A","It’s closely linked to the Treasury market,",""
"2020-03-15","Q&A","and it’s the way that our monetary policy decisions flow through to borrowers in the real economy.",""
"2020-03-15","Q&A","So, two very important markets.",""
"2020-03-15","Q&A","And they had reached levels of very high illiquidity,",""
"2020-03-15","Q&A","and—to the point where we—as you know,",""
"2020-03-15","Q&A","last week we offered financing—very large amounts of financing.",""
"2020-03-15","Q&A","we bought assets across the curve to try to support liquidity and return to normal function.",""
"2020-03-15","Q&A","And we found that that helped, but, nonetheless, we thought we had to do more.",""
"2020-03-15","Q&A","And we knew what we had to do,",""
"2020-03-15","Q&A","which was the asset purchase programs that we did today.",""
"2020-03-15","Q&A","And those are designed to restore those key markets to normal function.",""
"2020-03-15","Q&A","functioning well, then other markets—then that will spread to other markets.",""
"2020-03-15","Q&A","And those are the markets that—that amount to—that—where households and businesses typically get credit.",""
"2020-03-15","Q&A","So we know that dysfunctional financial markets—a dysfunctional financial system,",""
"2020-03-15","Q&A","can have very big negative effects on the economy.",""
"2020-03-15","Q&A","We saw that during the financial crisis.",""
"2020-03-15","Q&A","This is a very different situation,",""
"2020-03-15","Q&A","we thought it was quite important for us to take strong measures to support—to support proper market function in these important markets.",""
"2020-03-15","Q&A","Now, you asked about households.",""
"2020-03-15","Q&A","we don’t have the tools to reach individuals and particularly small businesses and other businesses and people who may be out of work or whose businesses may not—may experience a period of very low activity.",""
"2020-03-15","Q&A","We have the tools that we have, and we use them.",""
"2020-03-15","Q&A","I think we’ve used them quite aggressively for the benefit of the public.",""
"2020-03-15","Q&A","But this is a multifaceted problem,",""
"2020-03-15","Q&A","and it requires answers from different parts of the government and society.",""
"2020-03-15","Q&A","the most important is the response of the health-care workers and health-care policymakers.",""
"2020-03-15","Q&A","We’ve had one round of fiscal policy, another coming.",""
"2020-03-15","Q&A","I think fiscal policy is a way to direct relief,",""
"2020-03-15","Q&A","to particular populations and groups.",""
"2020-03-15","Q&A","you know—our original role was providing liquidity to financial systems when they’re under stress,",""
"2020-03-15","Q&A","and that’s—that’s really part of what we did today.",""
"2020-03-15","Q&A","The other role is to support demand through lower interest rates, and we did that.",""
"2020-03-15","Q&A","You—you asked about fiscal as well, and I guess I’ve sort of covered that.",""
"2020-03-15","Q&A","We do think fiscal response is—is critical,",""
"2020-03-15","Q&A","and we’re happy to see that those measures are being considered,",""
"2020-03-15","Q&A","and we—we hope they are effective.",""
"2020-03-15","Q&A","In your statement, you say that the market measures of inflation have declined.",""
"2020-03-15","Q&A","The Fed has undershot inflation in the last year,",""
"2020-03-15","Q&A","and that’s become one of the focuses of the FOMC meetings.",""
"2020-03-15","Q&A","does the Federal Reserve see deflation coming,",""
"2020-03-15","Q&A","and is this large cut meant to get in front of any more inflation?",""
"2020-03-15","Q&A","would the Fed consider buying securities outside of Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities?",""
"2020-03-15","Q&A","the—the economy’s performed so well,",""
"2020-03-15","Q&A","historically low unemployment—50-year-low unemployment for a couple of years,",""
"2020-03-15","Q&A","11 years—almost 11 years of expansion so far,",""
"2020-03-15","Q&A","and yet inflation lingered below 2 percent.",""
"2020-03-15","Q&A","So we’ve been concerned that inflation not move down further.",""
"2020-03-15","Q&A","It’s not at all a question of deflation.",""
"2020-03-15","Q&A","It was a question of not getting inflation up to our target on a robust,",""
"2020-03-15","Q&A","we judged that the—the net effects of this will be to— to have inflation move down even a little bit more.",""
"2020-03-15","Q&A","And it’s—it’s not a question—it’s not—it’s not an issue of deflation.",""
"2020-03-15","Q&A","Again, it’s just an issue of inflation probably falling even a bit further.",""
"2020-03-15","Q&A","you know—that it will fall a little bit further,",""
"2020-03-15","Q&A","we don’t have the legal authority to buy other securities other than the ones we already buy,",""
"2020-03-15","Q&A","and we’re not seeking authority to do so.",""
"2020-03-15","Q&A","We haven’t discussed that at the—at the FOMC,",""
"2020-03-15","Q&A","and it’s not—it’s not legal authority that we’re seeking.",""
"2020-03-15","Q&A","So what—what I can tell you definitively is what the purpose of the asset purchases was,",""
"2020-03-15","Q&A","and I mentioned this in my statement.",""
"2020-03-15","Q&A","And it really is to support the availability of credit in the economy—households and businesses—and thereby support the overall economy.",""
"2020-03-15","Q&A","They do that by supporting proper market functioning in the Treasury market and the MBS market.",""
"2020-03-15","Q&A","So you see—and I think you’ll see—as these purchases roll forward,",""
"2020-03-15","Q&A","you will see the Treasury market and the MBS market returning to normal market function,",""
"2020-03-15","Q&A","and that will actually support economic activity.",""
"2020-03-15","Q&A","That will be a positive for economic activity.",""
"2020-03-15","Q&A","In terms of what it’s labeled, that’s of less interest to me.",""
"2020-03-15","Q&A","I really think we are very clear in our minds what we’re doing this for and what the logical effects would be,",""
"2020-03-15","Q&A","which would be— which would be both better market function and—and—you know,",""
"2020-03-15","Q&A","when there’s better market function,",""
"2020-03-15","Q&A","policy will be supporting the economy better.",""
"2020-03-15","Q&A","So that’s the “in coming months” language.",""
"2020-03-15","Q&A","Let me tell you what we were doing there.",""
"2020-03-15","Q&A","So there’s no monthly cap here.",""
"2020-03-15","Q&A","and it’s going to buy at a strong rate that is—that we think will restore market function—restore liquidity as quickly as it can be restored.",""
"2020-03-15","Q&A","And that language is open ended,",""
"2020-03-15","Q&A","and it’s meant to send a signal to the market that—that,",""
"2020-03-15","Q&A","we’re not going to be bound by,",""
"2020-03-15","Q&A","$60 billion a month or anything like that.",""
"2020-03-15","Q&A","We’re going to go in strong starting tomorrow,",""
"2020-03-15","Q&A","and we’re going to buy across the curve,",""
"2020-03-15","Q&A","and we’re really going to use our tools to do what we need to do here,",""
"2020-03-15","Q&A","which is restore these important markets to normal function.",""
"2020-03-15","Q&A","So that—that’s really what that is.",""
"2020-03-15","Q&A","what we’ve said is that we will maintain the rate at this level until we’re confident that the economy has weathered recent events and is on track to achieve our maximum employment and price stability goals.",""
"2020-03-15","Q&A","So, you can see, that’s the test we’ve written down.",""
"2020-03-15","Q&A","you’ll see that some things have to happen goals.",""
"2020-03-15","Q&A","So that’s a test we’ll be looking at,",""
"2020-03-15","Q&A","we’re going to be watching and willing to be patient,",""
"2020-03-15","Q&A","You know, we have different tools.",""
"2020-03-15","Q&A","work pretty closely with the Treasury Department and—and cooperate with them on things,",""
"2020-03-15","Q&A","with clear lines of delineation.",""
"2020-03-15","Q&A","For example, the Treasury Department has authority over fiscal policy.",""
"2020-03-15","Q&A","It’s their job, with other parts of the Administration.",""
"2020-03-15","Q&A","It’s just that—like that for us with monetary policy.",""
"2020-03-15","Q&A","We have sole responsibility for monetary policy and strong instructions from Congress to conduct it in an independent,",""
"2020-03-15","Q&A","So those two things are—one for each of us.",""
"2020-03-15","Q&A","But in the middle there, there are areas where we—where we can cooperate.",""
"2020-03-15","Q&A","And also, there’s a long history.",""
"2020-03-15","Q&A","You would want the finance ministry and the treasury [and the central bank] to be talking in every major economy in the world.",""
"2020-03-15","Q&A","You would want them to be regularly exchanging information—professional relationships not just at the,",""
"2020-03-15","Q&A","but also through the organization.",""
"2020-03-15","Q&A","the New York Fed is have professional,",""
"2020-03-15","Q&A","good working relationships up and down the chain there,",""
"2020-03-15","Q&A","that—that seems to me to be working.",""
"2020-03-15","Q&A","And there is—there’s also quite a lot of coordination in other respects with—of course,",""
"2020-03-15","Q&A","but you didn’t ask about that.",""
"2020-03-15","Q&A","I feel very well, and so there’s no reason for me to be tested.",""
"2020-03-15","Q&A","We are observing—we’re trying to model good behavior here,",""
"2020-03-15","Q&A","so we’re observing quite a lot of teleworking.",""
"2020-03-15","Q&A","we’re not having a lot of big,",""
"2020-03-15","Q&A","crowded meetings—we’re not having any big,",""
"2020-03-15","Q&A","So we’re trying to observe all of the things that the professionals tell us to do.",""
"2020-03-15","Q&A","I do expect to do some teleworking because I want to model that—that it’s okay for the people to do so.",""
"2020-03-15","Q&A","In fact, it’s important for them to do so.",""
"2020-03-15","Q&A","In terms of our—of our toolkit,",""
"2020-03-15","Q&A","I think we do have plenty of space to adjust our policy.",""
"2020-03-15","Q&A","I mentioned our liquidity tools—you know,",""

"2020-03-15","Q&A","So a couple reasons we didn’t do an",""
"2020-03-15","Q&A","I think in the first instance—and you’re—you’re seeing some of this now—is the thing that fiscal policy and,",""
"2020-03-15","Q&A","only fiscal policy can do is reach out directly to affected industries,",""
"2020-03-15","Q&A","So, that’s—that’s an important job for fiscal policy.",""
"2020-03-15","Q&A","there’s the question of—of fiscal—broader fiscal stimulus,",""
"2020-03-15","Q&A","and I think that’ll depend on the path of the economy.",""
"2020-03-15","Q&A","I—I think there is such a wide range of possibilities here that it’s some—it’s very hard to predict.",""
"2020-03-15","Q&A","But there could certainly be—there could certainly be, you know, a need for that.",""
"2020-03-15","Q&A","And your second question was—what was your second question?",""
"2020-03-15","Q&A","So I guess your first question is,",""
"2020-03-15","Q&A","how—how do we think about the time—the time for this thing?",""
"2020-03-15","Q&A","the experts we talk to will say that they don’t know,",""
"2020-03-15","Q&A","It’s going to depend on a number of things.",""
"2020-03-15","Q&A","it’s the measures that we take to,",""
"2020-03-15","Q&A","and the—all the things businesses and school and everyone’s doing now.",""
"2020-03-15","Q&A","And that will depend, to some extent, on how compliant people are.",""
"2020-03-15","Q&A","You can see that some countries have had a—have been able to,",""
"2020-03-15","Q&A","through aggressive measures and really high compliance—have been able to bend the curve and—and do that.",""

"2020-03-15","Q&A","Sometimes fiscal policy comes in on a discretionary basis,",""

"2020-03-15","Q&A","but we do still have the power to designate institutions,",""
"2020-03-15","Q&A","that’s—that’s something that happens when markets are as volatile as they are,",""
"2020-03-15","Q&A","when you’re having these big market movements while markets are trying to understand what’s going on.",""
"2020-03-15","Q&A","They’re trying to reach a view on—in high uncertainty,",""
"2020-03-15","Q&A","and that’s why you see lots and lots of volatility.",""

"2020-04-29","Q&A","Nonetheless, these are lending powers.",""

"2020-04-29","Q&A","So I think we’ll be at—we’ll In terms of our statement,",""

"2020-04-29","Q&A","“[The] ongoing public health crisis will weigh heavily on economic activity,",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","and inflation in the near term and poses considerable risks to the economic outlook over the medium term.” So the “medium”—but what we meant by that,",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","It’s between now and the long term, so the next year or so.",""

"2020-04-29","Q&A","Will there be drugs that can either treat it or—or a vaccine of some kind?",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","So there’s—all of that is very much shrouded in uncertainty.",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","The second issue—and this is a very substantial one—is just the possibility of—of damage to the productive capacity of the economy through a couple of channels.",""

"2020-04-29","Q&A","that could be damaging to the performance of the economy over time.",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","So the good news is that we The third thing I would point to is just the global dimension.",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","This is a very global phenomenon,",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","and you are—we’re seeing economic data from around the globe which is very,",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","So on the first, as I mentioned, you know, we moved very quickly, very aggressively.",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","We were the first to return to the effective lower bound, where we are now.",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","We got there essentially right away, and we think that’s the right place to be.",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","the market expects us to—to be there for a good while,",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","it’s not as though the market is pricing in a near-term liftoff or anything like that.",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","we’re going to not be in any hurry to withdraw these measures or to lift off.",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","We’re going to wait until we’re—we’re quite confident that the economy is—is well on the road to recovery.",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","So we don’t see—we see our current stance and our current guidance—and I would say the same thing about asset purchases—we see them as appropriate.",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","I’ve—I’ve also mentioned now a couple times that we have done a lot of thinking about what monetary policy might look like over coming months,",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","depend on—on where we are in—in a range of potential economic scenarios.",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","So we—we were thinking about that all the time,",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","we think our current stance is appropriate.",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","So we made no change in it today.",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","how—so the thing about our facilities is,",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","Treasury still has plenty of equity.",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","So we’ve said that if—if demand for our facilities is greater than we’ve estimated,",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","And we have the ability to do that.",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","So it won’t be the way the—the Paycheck Protection Program is,",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","where there’s a specific amount allocated—appropriated for it,",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","and—and then there’s no more money.",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","That’s—that will be unlikely to happen here unless we exhaust Treasury’s equity,",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","and we’re a long way from doing that.",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","we build confidence in the market.",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","And private market participants come in.",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","And many companies that would’ve had to come to the Fed have now been able to finance themselves privately since we announced the—the initial term sheet on—on these facilities.",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","Companies are out there financing, they’re out there raising liquidity.",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","We haven’t made any corporate loans to—in those facilities.",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","We’ve made the short-term money market loans, but—we haven’t made any of them.",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","And yet there’s a tremendous amount of financing going on, and that’s a good thing.",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","the ultimate demand for the facilities is quite difficult to predict,",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","because there is this announcement effect that really gets the market functioning again.",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","Of course, we have to follow through, though.",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","And we will follow through to validate that—that announcement effect.",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","You know, as you know, economic forecasts are always uncertain.",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","and that’s—that’s really because so much of the performance of the economy depends on the path of the virus and the success of the measures we take to things either,",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","but what the experts tell us is that the outcomes are highly uncertain.",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","new kind of uncertainty added on top of our—our regular uncertainty.",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","there—I think there are a few things that you can say about—about the path ahead.",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","is going to be a time of sharp contraction in economic activity,",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","Personal consumption expenditures have declined sharply, business investment as well.",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","We’re going to see economic data for the second quarter that’s worse than any data we’ve seen for the economy.",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","And they’re a direct consequence of the disease and the measures that we’re taking to protect ourselves from it.",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","So then we will enter this new phase,",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","and we—we’re just beginning to maybe do that,",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","where we will—formal measures that require social distancing will be rolled back gradually and at different paces in different parts of the country.",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","And, in time, this—during this period, the economy will begin to recover.",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","People will come out of their homes, start to spend again.",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","We’ll see unemployment go down, we’ll see economic activity pick up.",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","And, you know, when will that be?",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","But let’s just say, for this purpose, that it’s in the third quarter.",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","So, as I mentioned earlier, that—that could be a fairly, you know, a large increase.",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","Given the— given the size of the fall,",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","the increase could also be substantially large,",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","although it’s unlikely that it would bring us quickly,",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","quickly all the way back to pre-crisis levels.",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","this is the period as well that carries the risk of new outbreaks of the virus,",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","something we really want to avoid.",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","at some point you will have—you know,",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","the kind of formal social-distancing measures will—will be gone,",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","but you’ll still be left with,",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","a level of the sooner we get the virus under control,",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","the sooner people can regain that confidence and regain their economic activity.",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","I think trying to be really precise about when that might happen and what the numbers might look like is—I think it’s very tough to do that.",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","That’s exactly what I worry about.",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","So unemployment has tended to go up much faster for minorities and for others who are—tend to be at the low end of the income spectrum.",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","And it tends to come down—come down faster as well,",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","but it tends to go up faster and be much,",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","And we were in a place—only two months ago,",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","we were well into—beginning the second half of the 11th year is where we were,",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","and every reason to think that it was ongoing.",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","We were hearing from minority—low- and moderate-income and minority communities that this was the best labor market they’d seen in their lifetime.",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","All the data supported that as well.",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","And it is heartbreaking, frankly, to see that all threatened now.",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","All the more need for our urgent response—and also that of Congress,",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","which has been urgent and large—and to do what we can to avoid longer-run damage to the economy,",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","which is what I—I everything we can to avoid that longer-run damage and try to get back to where we were,",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","because I do very much have that concern.",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","I think everyone is suffering here,",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","but I think those who are least able to—to bear it are the ones who are,",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","losing their jobs and losing their incomes and have little cushion to—you know,",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","to protect them in times like that.",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","So, yes, that’s a very big concern.",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","This is different from the PPP, the Paycheck Protection Program, in two ways.",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","One is, these are not grants, these are loans.",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","So I don’t know that the demand will be quite as strong as—as it has been for the",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","so we don’t—we’re not in a position to make,",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","a reliable assessment of when a vaccine or a therapeutic drug would be ready,",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","and so we’re not going to set our policies based on—on our estimate of that.",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","We’re going to just provide the In terms of Main Street,",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","we took those very much to heart.",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","We’ve spent a great deal of time here.",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","because it’s many different kinds of borrowers—they have different needs,",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","we’re very close to announcing a new term sheet,",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","which will then become operative fairly quickly.",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","that we’ll keep—we’ll keep looking to add products and add different kinds of borrowers to that as we go.",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","And we’re—we’re well aware of the importance of—of doing it as quickly as possible.",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","We, here, you know, we’re very much in touch with—with the urgency of that need.",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","So unemployment’s going to go up to a high number in the second quarter—uncertain what the number will be.",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","When—and that’s because so much economic activity has been shuttered,",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","as we take social-distancing measures.",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","And the— so sometime fairly soon here,",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","and probably gradually and at different paces at different parts of the country,",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","we’ll see the social-distancing measures rolled back.",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","People will begin to spend more money.",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","It’s, really, consumer spending has fallen precipitously.",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","And once that starts to happen,",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","people will get hired back and unemployment will go back down.",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","I don’t think it’ll get maximum employment.",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","we want to get back on that road.",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","We want to get that—that recovery going and get people back to work as fast as we can.",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","Not faster than we can, but as fast as we can.",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","The main thing is to get into that stage where the economy’s healing,",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","where we have the disease under control,",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","take too much risk of—of second and third waves and that sort of thing,",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","the path of it is highly uncertain,",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","but we will—we will be there with our tools,",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","supporting the economy and supporting that recovery.",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","Can you just say that part—you’re a little bit low volume.",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","You know, it’s an extraordinary, extraordinary shock, unlike anything, certainly, that’s happened in my lifetime.",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","And a couple things come to mind.",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","I—I think the time will come for a careful assessment of the answers to those questions.",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","We’re still putting out the fire.",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","And I think we’ll be at that for a while.",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","are they’re running and how to manage them.",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","So the breakdowns that we’ve seen in market function have really been in the capital markets.",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","And I don’t—I wouldn’t rush in with prudential regulation into the capital markets.",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","But I think—and we did plenty of things—you know,",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","we did a lot of reform in the capital markets:",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","But there—there will no doubt be— with this—the size and force of this shock will no doubt reveal weaknesses in the financial architecture,",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","and we’ll have to go to work on those.",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","it tells you the importance of—of getting your fiscal house in order.",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","we think that inflation is very closely and strongly related to inflation expectations.",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","And during the Global Financial Crisis,",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","there was a concern that we might see deflation,",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","Inflation expect—inflation tended to move down a little bit,",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","as it will when demand is weak.",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","And—but inflation expectations did not move strongly down here in the United States.",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","They have in other places in the world, though, over the past 25 years.",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","There’s been downward pressure on inflation, really, for several decades now.",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","as long as inflation expectations remain anchored,",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","then we shouldn’t see deflation.",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","And the Federal Reserve is strongly committed to maintaining 2 percent inflation over time.",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","So we’ll be there to work on that.",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","I think you asked, really, about headline inflation.",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","If— if low energy prices—very low energy prices were to—were to drop headline inflation negative,",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","I—I would hope that people would see through that—and we’ll be monitoring it very carefully— would see through it,",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","which is a better predictor of future inflation.",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","So, needless to say, we’ll be keeping very close track of that.",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","In terms of the markets, you know, our—our concern is that they be working.",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","We’re not—we’re not focused on the level of asset prices in particular,",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","it’s just—markets are trying to price in something that is so uncertain as to be unknowable,",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","which is the path of this virus globally and its effect on the economy.",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","And that’s very, very hard to do.",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","That’s why you see volatility the way it’s been,",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","market reacting to—to things with a lot of volatility.",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","But, you know, what we’re trying to assure, really, is that the market is working.",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","The market is assessing risks,",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","asset prices are moving in response to events.",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","see—that’s when you see, you know, very sharp negative—even more negative economic outcomes.",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","So I think our measures have—have supported market function pretty well.",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","You know, we’re going to stay very careful, carefully monitoring that.",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","But I think it’s been good to see markets working again.",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","the flow of credit in the economy has been a positive thing,",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","as businesses have been able to build up their liquidity buffers and households have been able to be home—you know,",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","but they’re not concerned about the financial system collapsing as they were in 2008 and ’09.",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","So we think that low interest rates affect the economy through a number of channels in a positive way.",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","Lower interest rates support economic activity through channels that we—overall,",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","through channels that we understand reasonably well.",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","They make it cheaper to borrow,",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","They do—they do raise asset prices, including the value of your home.",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","If your saver owns a home or has a 401(k),",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","your saver will benefit from that.",""

"2020-04-29","Q&A","really just relying on their bank savings account earnings,",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","that’s—that’s—you’re not going to benefit from low interest rates.",""

"2020-04-29","Q&A","Low interest rates support employment, they support economic activity, and those are our mandates.",""

"2020-04-29","Q&A","low interest rates are a good thing.",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","And that’s not to say they’re good for every single person,",""

"2020-04-29","Q&A","In terms of how low, I really don’t want to speculate.",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","You know, we will turn to questions like that soon enough.",""
"2020-04-29","Q&A","But the—in terms of how long we’ll stay and under what conditions we’ll stay at the effective lower bound,",""

"2020-06-10","Q&A","if you look at the May employment report,",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","it’s a pretty good—probably the biggest data surprise that anybody can remember.",""

"2020-06-10","Q&A","you’ll know that we—we had a 128-month expansion,",""

"2020-06-10","Q&A","but we never did quite get there.",""

"2020-06-10","Q&A","So I do—I think we’re in the right place now.",""

"2020-06-10","Q&A","depending on how you count it,",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","well more than 20 million people displaced in the labor market.",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","And we are going to be deploying our tools—all of our tools,",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","in pursuit of that—of those goals,",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","I would start with—that’s where I would start.",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","we were—we just had a period of unemployment,",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","that was in the—well below 4 percent,",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","And during that period of time,",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","we saw a lot of great things happening in the labor market,",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","things that we’d love to get back to.",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","We didn’t see any problems with price inflation.",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","Price inflation didn’t really react on—on unemployment just based on what we—what we saw in the last—in the last expansion.",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","So, you know, we’re—we’re not thinking about raising rates.",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","We’re not even thinking about thinking about raising rates.",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","So what we’re thinking about is—is providing support for this economy.",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","We do think this is going to take some time.",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","I think most forecasters believe that.",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","It would be great if—if we got a whole bunch more months of job creation like that.",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","there are—there are just a lot of people that are unemployed.",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","And it seems quite likely that there will be a significant group at the end of— even—even after a lot of strong job growth,",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","that’ll still be struggling to find jobs,",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","and we’ll still be providing strong accommodation for that.",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","I don’t think that the—that the Great Depression is a good example or a likely outcome or a model for what’s happening here at all.",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","And there—there are just so many fundamental differences.",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","First, the government response has been so fast and so forceful.",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","The origin was quite different.",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","This was a very—an economy that was in a healthy place.",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","every economy has longer-run challenges,",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","not—and that—that includes our economy,",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","notwithstanding that 50-year low in unemployment and the longest expansion in our was in—was in very good shape,",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","So, you know, it’s just not the right model.",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","You know, every month that passes, we’re seeing more, we’re learning more.",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","And I think particularly the next few months will be very important in learning what the—what the real story will be,",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","because we’ll see the—the significant incoming data about the opening of the economy—the reopening of the economy.",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","assuming that the—that the—that the disease remains or becomes pretty much under control,",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","I think that what you see is a—is a very weak second quarter,",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","and then an—an expansion that builds momentum over time.",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","probably a little bit gradually,",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","to some of the activities that would— that involve getting together in small—in large groups in close quarters.",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","Those will be the harder parts of the economy to recover.",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","But, ultimately, we do see a full recovery over time.",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","And that’s really what, you know, what I think I’m—I’m personally seeing.",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","And you could see significant job growth in—in coming months as people return to their jobs,",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","but you’re still going to face probably an extended period where it will be difficult for many people to find work.",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","And for—and that’s what you see in—in—in, really, many, many forecasts at this point.",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","but that’s sort of a—a broad expectation,",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","certainly not the Depression forecast.",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","Chris, this is a really important risk.",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","And I think it’s—it’s not the risk for the next few months,",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","but it’s the risk over time of—of lasting damage to the—to these— you know,",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","to the productive capacity of the United States,",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","One, through extended periods of unemployment, people lose contact with the labor force.",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","They get out of touch with the skills and—that they need,",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","and—and they have a hard time getting back in,",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","it’s very damaging to people’s lives and their working lives.",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","in a way—it can—it can increase the—you know,",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","but it can also lower the labor force participation rate,",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","to have people dropping out of the labor force where we need them in the—in the labor force working.",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","The other piece of it is just businesses.",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","You know, a shock like this that just comes in, it’s like a natural disaster.",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","You wouldn’t want a lot of perfectly good businesses,",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","particularly the smaller and medium-sized businesses that may not have a lot of resources to sustain them to— you know,",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","to go out of business permanently in a situation like that—like this where,",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","Of course, you know, businesses are going to go in and out.",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","They’re going to fail all the time, and that’s a healthy thing in capitalism.",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","That’s something that has to We didn’t change.",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","We didn’t change our longer-run estimate of—of potential growth or of the unemployment rate.",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","the reason I didn’t change mine is that I still—I—I think we can avoid that or avoid much of that,",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","And—and we do that with measures that—that,",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","And that’s all the things that we’re trying to do.",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","if you look at what’s happened,",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","there’s something—somewhere short of 25 million people have been displaced,",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","even after the good May employment report.",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","What we’re trying to do is create an environment in which they have the best chance either to go back to their old job or to get a new job.",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","That’s—that’s kind of the most important part of this exercise.",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","And maybe these—it’s probably hopeful at this point to say that—that we won’t have longer-run damage to the economy,",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","and these numbers won’t change.",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","So—but I think it’s way too early to be—to be changing the longer run—see,",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","these are—these are not meant to be short- run numbers.",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","so I—I would—I have not changed mine,",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","and I’m hopeful that—that I won’t have to change it.",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","There have been gains in market function,",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","although not fully back to where you would say they were,",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","We don’t take those gains for granted, though.",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","This is a—this is a highly fluid situation,",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","and we’re— we’re not taking those for granted.",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","as I pointed out in my—in my statement,",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","those purchases are clearly also supporting highly accommodative—or accommodative financial conditions,",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","and that’s—that’s a good thing,",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","so that’s why we’re doing that.",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","Turning quickly to Main Street,",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","so I would say that the thing—what we’ve done on Main Street,",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","So we’ve been out repeatedly for feedback in trying to create a—a much more difficult product than,",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","And I think this—this last set of changes we made have actually been very positive for the facility.",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","I think it’s going to be better able to achieve its goals,",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","And that—we are now in the—in the—in the final run-up to starting the facility.",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","as you saw earlier—I guess it’s early this week or late,",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","whenever we did it in the last few days—was we lowered the minimum loan size and we increased the maximum loan size.",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","we lengthened the maturity and we stretched out the repayment schedule significantly.",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","So borrowers will get a—a two-year delay until they have to make any principal payments—repayments and a one-year delay on interest.",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","So we had been hearing from The next step will be to register lenders.",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","At that time, loans can begin to be made.",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","the facility itself will be up,",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","and those facilities can be—those loans can be sold—95 percent of the loans.",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","And it’s 95 percent across the board now in the Main Street facility can be sold.",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","So all of that should happen quickly now.",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","And I do think this has—this has been a challenging project,",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","but I think we’ve come to a—to a better place.",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","we’re—we’re going to be prepared to adapt further,",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","And—and that’s true of all of our facilities.",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","There’s no—there’s no playbook here.",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","You—you have to draw this up and then try it out.",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","And we’ve—we’ve been, you know, very willing to adapt and will continue to be.",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","I think we try to keep our comments on fiscal policy at a high level, and I’ll—I’ll come to your specific question, but I would just say this: This is the biggest economic shock in the",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","but I will provide a little context for the— for—I want to be clear about the picture—one way to look at the picture,",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","You can—you can get at this by looking at,",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","the—the—the widest measure of unemployment,",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","And the U—that’s the— the one we look—talk about all the time is called U-3,",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","And the—the one that has a much broader measurement of slack in the economy is U-6.",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","the U-6 level of unemployment has tripled from 7 percent to 21 percent.",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","That—that amounts to 22 million additional people who are—who’ve—who’ve lost work in the economy either by going to part time or something like that.",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","So that’s in the low 20s, and that’s post the May employment report.",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","You can get at it a different way.",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","You can look at—at just the regular unemployment rate.",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","You can take the 21 [million]—people who have—had—are listed as unemployed right now.",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","You can add more on for the ones who were miscoded.",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","You can also take those people who are suddenly out of the labor force.",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","You put those together, and that has gone up by about 24 million.",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","So those are two different measures of what’s happened.",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","So the question is, 20, 22, 24 million people—got to get them back to work.",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","Somehow, we’ve got to all, as a country, get those people back to work.",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","They didn’t do anything wrong;",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","and I—I really—I do think the responses so far have been great.",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","So that’s the way I would think about it.",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","And if—if you think we—I would just,",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","in terms of the May employment report,",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","I think what people were thinking was that you’d start to get those back- to-work kind of numbers in June and July and August.",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","Very few people saw them in May.",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","I mean, almost no one saw that happening as early as mid-May, but it did.",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","it is clear evidence of just how uncertain things are,",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","and—and how humble we have to be about our ability to—to really have confident predictions as opposed to just predictions.",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","that—that—the key thing people need to understand is that there’s just a lot of work to do in the labor market.",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","We’re going to stick with this and support that until the work is done.",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","That you—you can—that is something we’re going to do with all of our tools,",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","and I think it may require Congress to help as well.",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","It may, but that’s going to be their decision.",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","On—you also asked about the second wave.",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","we have major responsibilities and powerful tools,",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","but the decision about when to reopen the economy is one for elected officials at the state and local and federal level.",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","we—we don’t have any particular expertise here at the Fed in pandemics or coronaviruses or anything like that.",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","so we don’t have anything special to add on that.",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","you could see a public loss of confidence in—in parts of the economy that will be already slow to recover.",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","So it could hurt the recovery even if you don’t have a national-level pandemic,",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","just a—just a series of—of local ones,",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","of local spikes could—could have the effect of undermining people’s confidence in traveling,",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","anything that involves getting people together in small groups and feeding them or flying them around—those things could be hurt.",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","So it would not be a positive development, and I’ll just leave it at that.",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","in May we saw 55—at least 55 companies file for bankruptcy.",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","Do you think that it is too late, first of all?",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","the future of these facilities—is this a one-year impact to the economy through these facilities,",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","We have, you know, significant interest, we think.",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","And also, remember, lots and lots of companies are getting financed, too.",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","you have a—a—a much better lending climate than—than certainly than we had in February and March.",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","We don’t think it’s too late, though.",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","We—we— and we do expect it to be up quite soon.",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","In terms of the timing of these things,",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","we’ll leave them open as—we’ll leave them open for new loans as long as they need to.",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","That’ll be a decision we make, of course, with our colleagues at the Treasury Department.",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","there won’t be a need for further loans,",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","and—and then the assets will—will be there.",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","And so if that’s—I don’t know if that’s a part of your question too,",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","the—the useful role of the—of the Federal Reserve is probably close to an end at that point.",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","We don’t have any expertise in managing pools of credit assets,",""

"2020-06-10","Q&A","so we’d be looking to have that done either someplace else or,",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","by—by a third party or at the Treasury Department or something.",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","And we’re, you know, we’re working on ideas for that.",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","I would say that many forecasters had been expecting a bottom for the economy in—around the middle of the year,",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","with—with a huge range of uncertainty.",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","I think the labor market—the evidence of one jobs report is that the labor market may have hit bottom in May.",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","We don’t know that; we’re going to see.",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","many forecasters widely expect a—a recovery over the second half of the year.",""

"2020-06-10","Q&A","we’re going to be here with our tools supporting this economy for as long as it’s needed.",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","So—but I think there’s a possibility that—that the bottom has come in the labor market,",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","We’ll—we’ll know more as we go forward.",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","the effect of the pandemic on inequality,",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","it hits those industries that are—that involve groups of people in tight groups,",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","either in places where they’re—it’s the travel,",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","those kinds of service-economy jobs.",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","And so a lot of the lost jobs were from people who work in the service economy,",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","and relatively—compared to other jobs,",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","So, and if—if you just look at what percentage in the workforce.",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","because if you just go back two months,",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","the first tight labor market in a quarter-century.",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","And for the last couple of years before the pandemic hit,",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","you were seeing wages go up the most for people at the lower end of the wage spectrum,",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","we were meeting with people from low- and—low- and moderate-income communities all over the country and hearing,",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","Do whatever you—do whatever you can.",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","This is the best labor market we’ve seen.” And we had every expect—every expectation,",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","every reason to expect that this would continue,",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","so—we really want to get it back.",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","And so I think we learned a number of things over the course of the last few years.",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","3½ percent unemployment for a couple of years,",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","you see modest moves in wages and relatively almost invisible moves in inflation.",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","So that was not anybody’s understanding of the structure of the economy,",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","So we can use our tools to—to support the labor market and support the economy.",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","We can—we can use them until we do fully recover,",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","and that—that’s what we’re planning to do.",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","You know, we don’t target different groups.",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","What—what we are—we are cognizant of the fact,",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","the benefits really do go more to people at the lower end of the wage spectrum for—for the first time in many years when labor",""

"2020-06-10","Q&A","we—we don’t— the—we don’t tend to incorporate things we’re highly uncertain about.",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","So I think the—the forecast would not have included substantial additional—you know,",""

"2020-06-10","Q&A","something that looks like a—a low-end guess on what might come out of the current negotiations.",""

"2020-06-10","Q&A","you’d see—you’d see better results sooner,",""

"2020-06-10","Q&A","You know, we’re—we’re spending a lot, and that’s really what they get to decide.",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","In terms of Main Street and our willingness to expand it further,",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","I think we’re—one thing we’re looking at—very strongly looking at is—is nonprofits,",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","and is there a way to—to incorporate them into—into that facility or a similar facility.",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","it could be—it could be in terms of size,",""

"2020-06-10","Q&A","But I—I think we have a good product to go to market with now,",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","and I think it’ll get— it’ll get out there soon.",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","And, you know, we’ll see, and—and we’ll be willing to continue to adapt.",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","I don’t have a reliable estimate of that.",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","Clearly, not everyone will go back.",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","but what’s—what’s going to be the remainder when—you know,",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","when we reach sort of what is the new normal?",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","but it—it could be a good number of millions of people,",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","but these—I’d say you’re so early in the process.",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","people are going back and looking at other significant changes in the economy,",""

"2020-06-10","Q&A","I—I don’t want to give you a number,",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","because it’s going to be a guess,",""

"2020-06-10","Q&A","there isn’t a—there may not be a job in that industry for them for some time.",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","is—is they know other people in that industry,",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","If you have to go to a different industry and start over again,",""

"2020-06-10","Q&A","it’s still close to twice the white unemployment—it is twice the unemployment rate,",""

"2020-06-10","Q&A","It’s certainly much higher now.",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","the—the best thing we can do with our monetary policy tools is to—is to look at,",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","the evidence of what we saw—that we saw with our own eyes so recently,",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","which is that the economy can have very low unemployment—very low unemployment.",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","It could’ve inflation back up to target—without seeing wages getting out of touch with—with where they should be,",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","so that’s the—that’s the biggest thing we can do.",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","in—in—inequality is something that’s been with us increasingly for more than four decades,",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","and it’s—it’s not really related to monetary policy.",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","or—or it’s more related to—there are a lot of theories on—on what causes it,",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","but it’s been something that’s more or less been going up consistently for more than four decades.",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","And there are a lot of different theories,",""

"2020-06-10","Q&A","They couldn’t roll over their debt.",""

"2020-06-10","Q&A","as I—as I mentioned in my opening remarks,",""

"2020-06-10","Q&A","is on—on the state of the economy and on the labor market and on inflation.",""
"2020-06-10","Q&A","and we think it’s very likely to remain low for some time,",""

"2020-07-29","Q&A","And dollar funding markets were in very difficult shape at the time.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","And the introduction of the swap lines has really to facilitate planning by other central banks and just so people will know that those facilities are still there.",""

"2020-07-29","Q&A","the crisis and the economic fallout from—from the pandemic are far from over,",""

"2020-07-29","Q&A","and—$454 billion for our facilities,",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","and it’s really a question for them.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","So you’re right that our facilities have not—we haven’t done as much lending as we thought.",""

"2020-07-29","Q&A","very confident that the turmoil from the pandemic and the economic fallout are behind us.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","So I—I can’t really speak to what Congress should do with it,",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","but it’s important that the facilities be there and be fully funded in case the needs do arise down the road.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","We don’t see them now, but, in case they do arise, they should be there.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","So, on your first question, I wouldn’t want to be giving very detailed, specific advice on particular programs and the level they should be at and that kind of thing.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","I just will say the following, that, you know, this—this pandemic and its fallout really represents the biggest shock to the",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","the asset purchases in—in their current size really sprang from severe dysfunction in the Treasury and MBS markets at the beginning of the market reaction to the pandemic.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","And thanks to those purchases, we have substantially restored—not fully, but substantially restored functioning markets.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","That market is really one of the—it’s part of the absolute bedrock of the global financial markets,",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","and it’s—it’s essential that it—that it work well,",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","and are fine with the fact that—that those purchases are also fostering a more accommodative stance of monetary policy,",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","which would tend to support macroeconomic outcomes.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","So it’s doing both, and—and, you know, we’ve understood that for some time.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","It’s not—the programs are not structured exactly like the—the QE programs were in the last—in the last financial—in the aftermath of the last financial crisis.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","Those were more focused on buying longer-run securities.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","The current purchases are all across the—the maturity spectrum.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","Nonetheless, they are supporting accommodative financial conditions.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","I think it’s—it’s clear that that’s the case.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","In terms of our strategy, you know, that just remains to be seen.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","we’ve spent a lot of time in meetings this year looking at the tools that we have to adjust our current stance of policy.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","We do feel that our current monetary policy stance is the appropriate one.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","You know, we cut rates close to zero right at the beginning.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","We—we ramped up asset purchases, and those—those have really helped.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","And we gave forward guidance on—on both of those things,",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","which the markets appear to understand,",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","and market pricing is consistent with better foster achievement of our goals,",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","Well, so—so BlackRock is just our agent.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","we make the policy decisions in conjunction with our colleagues,",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","and they just execute our—our plans.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","I actually don’t remember exactly what I would have been talking with him about,",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","he’s the head of a major service provider.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","He generally checks in to find out whether we’re okay with the quality of the service that—that BlackRock is providing.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","I don’t have the daily face-to-face interaction with anybody else at BlackRock or—or,",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","three phone calls in the course of a few months.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","their conflicts are managed extremely carefully in the contractual arrangements we have with them.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","I would have—I—I can’t recall exactly what those conversations were,",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","but they were—they would have been about what are you seeing in the markets and things like that too—you know,",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","And he’s—he’s typically trying to make sure that—that we are getting good service from the company that he founded and leads.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","That’s—I’d say that’s his main objective when we talk.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","So—the situation with coins is that the—the quantity of coins is going up but was adequate before the pandemic.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","The problem is, the circulation kind of stopped because stores were closed, banks were closed.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","It just—customers weren’t spending, they were—so the coins stopped moving in the system.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","So we’ve been working for—ever since that began to happen, we saw it happening right away.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","We’ve been working to try to—try to reverse that disruption of the supply chain and restore normal circulation for our coins.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","So maybe I’ll talk more broadly about the—the outlook and include your—include your question in it.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","economic activity and employment picked up beginning in May and right through June and remained well below their levels because,",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","job gains have reversed about a third of the job losses from March and April,",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","and consumer spending has reversed about a half of the drop.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","So—but, nonetheless, those were—those were sooner and stronger than we expected.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","So—but what happened then was,",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","along with that positive data,",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","we got—we got the virus increases starting in the middle of June in lots and lots of states around the country.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","And that brings us to a new—a new point here,",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","we need to—in addition to dealing with the health crisis—we have to remember,",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","this is really a health crisis,",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","and these are people who are having the coronavirus,",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","and it’s taking a terrible toll,",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","so we’ve got to deal with the economic ramifications of that.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","So what we’re seeing is that we monitor quite a lot of what we—what we think of as sort of nonstandard,",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","That’s become a very important thing,",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","even more important than usual in the work that we do.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","is that the pace of the recovery looks like it has slowed since the cases began that spike in June.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","So some measures of consumer spending based on credit card and debit card data have moved down.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","Recent labor market indicators point to a slowing in job growth, particularly among smaller businesses.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","Hotel occupancy rates have flattened out.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","People aren’t going out to restaurants, bars, gas stations, pharmacies, and beauty salons as much.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","Consumer surveys, by the way, There are still some areas of strength.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","Housing and motor vehicle sales have still been strong.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","it looks like the data are pointing to a slowing in the pace of the recovery.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","it’s—it’s too early to say both how large that is and how sustained it will be.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","because we have to wait for—to see the,",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","the actual data on spending and employment come in,",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","and—but this—this is what we’re seeing,",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","we’re monitoring it very carefully.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","And I’d be remiss in not stressing this enough.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","The path of the economy is going to depend to a very high extent on the course of the virus and on the measures that we take to keep it in check.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","That is just a very fundamental fact about our economy right now.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","The two things are not in conflict.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","You know, social-distancing measures and fast reopening of the economy, they actually go together.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","They’re not in competition with each other.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","I think we feel that it—it might be,",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","the most central fact or the most central driver of the path of the economy right now is the virus.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","And you’re seeing that again now.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","You saw that in the—during the lockdown when we got cases way down,",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","and that there is a slower pace of growth,",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","We don’t know how deep or how long that will be.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","So it’s such an important sentence.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","We just decided that it needed to be in our—in our postmeeting statement.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","And, you know, I think we can’t say it enough.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","We’re—you know, you can think of it as three stages.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","and we know what that looks like,",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","later this week on GDP being down very historically large amounts.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","and we would expect that many,",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","many people would go back to work.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","Those whose jobs could be done without—you know,",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","without exposure to lots of people in tight groups,",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","they should have been—they should be able to go back to work during that phase fairly quickly.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","But that would depend on being able to keep the virus under control,",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","which will depend on wearing masks and other social-distancing measures.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","It’s such an important factor.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","It’s—it’s in—we’re all talking about it,",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","so we thought it really had to be in the statement.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","We are committed to using our full range of tools to support the",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","So we—of course, the concept of vaccines comes up in our discussions.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","we’re—our job is not to plan for the upside case,",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","The upside case—we’ve got that covered.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","Our job is to plan for all—the full range of things that could happen.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","And so we’re assuming—we’re going to continue to assume that our facilities are needed,",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","and that the public needs—you know,",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","needs the support that we’re giving the public until—until shown otherwise.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","There’s great uncertainty around the development of therapeutics and vaccines.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","All of us want them to happen as soon as possible,",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","We’ve got to hope for the worst—hope for the [laughs]—hope for the best and plan for the worst,",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","In terms of inflation, I don’t know.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","I mean, I—you know, I think, fundamentally, this is a disinflationary shock.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","I know there—there is a lot of discussion about how this might lead to inflation over time,",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","we’re—we’re seeing disinflationary pressures around the world going into this.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","Now we see a big shock to demand,",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","and we see core inflation dropping to 1 percent.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","And I do think for quite some time we’re going to be struggling against disinflationary pressures rather than against inflationary pressures.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","So, you know, as we’ve said, we’re carefully monitoring the situation.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","We moved very quickly and very aggressively early, and we’ve been monitoring the situation.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","And I think the markets and—and the economy—you know,",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","I think our policy is in a good place.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","But we’ve looked at—at ways of adapting our policy as time goes by,",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","and we’re ready to do that when we think it’s appropriate.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","I can’t give you a specific trigger.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","It really just is when we think it would help:",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","Would it help more than what we’re doing now to foster maximum employment and stable prices?",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","Sorry, your second question was?",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","we’re not even thinking about—thinking about raising rates.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","We’re—we’re totally focused on providing the economy the support that it will need.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","We think that the economy will need highly accommodative monetary policy and the use of our tools for an extended period.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","And we’re absolutely committed to staying in this until—until we’re very confident that that is no longer needed.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","So I wouldn’t look for us to be sending signals about cutting back on facilities or anything like that for a very long time.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","We’re—we’re in this until—until we’re well through it.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","of people are struggling to get back to work because those—those heavily affected areas of the economy are going to be challenged,",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","to employ the millions of people who are now out of work.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","I think 14 million people are now out of work who were working in February,",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","So that’s going to take a while, I think, in everyone’s reckoning.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","And I just—everyone should know that we’re going to be there for all of that.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","So, first, on the unemployment, you’re right.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","And we always point this out in our—in our remarks.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","While the aggregate unemployment rate was 3½ percent,",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","every—every economy—every market in every economy has longer-run issues.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","And one of ours is just the disparate level of unemployment between—between Blacks and whites.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","And it’s generally sort of twice as much—twice as high for Blacks.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","So even—but this was the lowest,",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","in recent years to focus considerable time and attention on disparate levels of unemployment—for example,",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","among—among different racial groups and demographic groups.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","We regularly discuss those differences in our FOMC discussions.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","We call them out in testimony and in speeches and in our Monetary Policy Report to Congress.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","You’ll see it everywhere, in all the things that we do.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","I think what we learned is that a tight labor market really does a lot of good things for minorities and people at the lower end of the income spectrum generally.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","it took 8 years—it took sort of the 8th and 9th and 10th years of that expansion to get to those benefits.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","That’s not a good strategy, waiting 8, 9, 10 years to get there.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","So we’re—we’re going to get back there as fast as we can,",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","because that’s what we can do,",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","but society more broadly can affect these things.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","we don’t really have tools that can address distributional,",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","disparate outcomes as well as fiscal policy.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","And just policy generally—education, health care, all those things are much better at doing that.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","In terms of—so we do—you will see that—you will see that discussed—the Black unemployment rate discussed all the time in what we do.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","And I think we clearly understand now that it’s something to weigh when you get a tight labor market.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","It’s something that you want to be focused on and weigh.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","So it is very much in our thinking—again,",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","in a world where we don’t really have the best tools to address that.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","So, something that we’re doing.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","So I have not seen that—I did not see that blog post yet,",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","although someone did mention it to me.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","We, of course, have been in meetings until just before this.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","but—and I will take a been a lot of pain and injustice and unfair treatment that women have experienced in the workplace—not just among economists,",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","but among economists and at the Fed.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","That’s been going on for far too long.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","the Fed could have done more and—and should have done more.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","we have made it a very high priority to have as diverse and inclusive an organization as we can.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","And I think we’ve made a lot of progress on that.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","I think we want a place where it’s free to speak,",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","where people can disagree but must do so respectfully.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","I think a lot of organizations are coming around to understanding the importance of that.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","from my career in business too,",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","is that organizations—the really successful organizations in our society get this.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","they get it that if you want to attract the best people,",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","this is what you—you’re going to attract the best people by having a diverse and inclusive workforce,",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","So we’ve made diversity a priority.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","We actually—you know, this has been a big issue for the economics profession.",""

"2020-07-29","Q&A","how big are the risks of the unemployment rate rising and job growth turning negative this summer?",""

"2020-07-29","Q&A","the official labor market reports come out once a month,",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","and no one has had a very good record lately of predicting what they’re going to say.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","They’ve been, in May and June, stronger than anybody expected, particularly in May.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","some humility is appropriate here in terms of thinking we understand exactly where this is going.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","I think all we can say today is that there’s—there’s evidence in the high-frequency data,",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","you’re tracking—you get pictures of spending.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","You get pictures of people’s movements.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","And what we—it looks like we’re seeing a slowdown in the rate of growth.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","That’s—and that might be—it might be short lived, it might not be, you know.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","And it seems to be related to—and the timing of it seems to be related to the spike in cases that began in the middle of June.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","Now, I really don’t want to get ahead of where the data are on this.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","So we’re just going to have to see.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","We’re going to have to—the data over the next couple of months will answer that question.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","And recent experience suggests we—we need to wait and see.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","there’s clearly a risk that we’re going to see a slowdown in the rate of growth in economic activity and in hiring.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","It might still be at a robust level.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","Honestly, we—we will not know until we start to see more data come in.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","You know, we haven’t—we haven’t looked at that, and we have no—no intention.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","We haven’t done any work or thought about buying equities.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","we—we’re bound by the—by the provisions of 13(3),",""

"2020-07-29","Q&A","meaning we have to have—it can’t just be focused on one entity.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","You know, it has to be a broad group of entities.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","There’s a lot in 13(3) about—about the solvency of the borrowers.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","it was rewritten or amended after the financial crisis,",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","and it was written in a way that was—that was to—meant to make it challenging to bail out large financial institutions.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","That’s— there was a lot in there to make sure that,",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","that they were going to be solvent and things like that.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","So, you know, we have to meet those requirements.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","we haven’t looked and said—tried to say,",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","“Let’s make a complete list.” You know,",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","that we could buy corporate bonds and—and municipal bonds,",""

"2020-07-29","Q&A","Honestly, we haven’t tried to push it to, you know, what’s the theoretical limit market has stopped functioning.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","That’s fundamentally what you’re doing with 13(3).",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","And—and so I think you’ve got to—you’ve got to sort of work within that framework.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","I—I think that the main thing that tells you is that the—the labor market has a long way to go to recover.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","You know, we had a good labor market.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","There are always going to be issues within an economy.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","But the labor market really has a long way to go now.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","Even with two very strong months of job creation—7½ million jobs between the two months—we still have 14 million people unemployed.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","So it’s just—it’s a long way to go.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","And as—and that leads to a situation where there are so many people looking for jobs,",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","and we have the economy only partially reopened.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","you know—until the economy—or as the economy fully reopens,",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","but—so it’s a tough situation.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","And I’ve read reports of that.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","the reported wages went up because of the composition effect—you know,",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","it’s low-paid workers didn’t go back to work,",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","so—they were the ones that got laid off—so average hourly earnings went up.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","clearly the pressure—there will not be much upward pressure on wages and compensation at the aggregate labor force and—and to support those who are—who want to be in the labor force but whose jobs have gone away for some period of time as they find other work due to this natural disaster.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","So that’s a great discussion that we—we’ve talked about that at past meetings,",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","and I imagine we will at future meetings and haven’t made any decisions yet on that.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","But, you know, you’ve got a couple ways to go.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","You can tie—you can tie them to dates.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","You can say we will—for a specific period of time,",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","we will keep rates at X level.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","Or you can say we’ll keep them there until you achieve a certain macroeconomic goal.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","And it can either be inflation or it could be an employment goal,",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","there’s attraction in all of those depending on the situation,",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","You can imagine situations where,",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","where you’d really want to be targeting macroeconomic outcomes.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","It’s also the case, though, that sometimes— sometimes date-based guidance works too.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","I think it really is very fact specific,",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","and it’s not something we’ve—you know,",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","we haven’t made any decisions on that,",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","so I wouldn’t be standing here telling you we’re going to go this way or that way,",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","should the time come for us to—to change our forward guidance.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","the stimulus bill that Senate Republicans are considering,",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","they’ve said that they’re weighing whether to revise the Collins Amendment in order to ease the tier 1 leverage ratio for banks.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","Are you concerned that doing so will deplete bank capital,",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","given that the Fed’s stress tests showed that,",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","under the most severe scenarios for economic recovery,",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","that several banks would approach the regulatory minimum capital requirements?",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","So I think what the stress tests showed is that,",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","under the “regular way” stress test,",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","But right in the middle of the—of the stress test came the pandemic.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","And so we quickly dropped in three other scenarios,",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","And many of the banks passed, but some didn’t.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","So we—and that was done very quickly.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","and we used the provision that says we can—that says there’s been a material change,",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","and we’re going to ask them to resubmit their capital plans.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","We also stopped buybacks—share buybacks and limited dividends.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","So we’re working through the details of how all of that will work.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","I think we’re going to—I think we’re going to send out the—the stress scenarios on September 30th.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","So, I would say, that’s—you know, that—that process is working that way.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","And—but you’re making a connection to it, to the Collins Amendment fix.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","So what’s going on there is that,",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","like many other supervisors and regulators around the world,",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","what we found is that our—we have found our banks are strong.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","They’re strongly capitalized, with lots of liquidity.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","And they’ve really been a source of strength in this—in this crisis so far.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","And they’ve written off bad loans and things like that.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","They’re still well capitalized and strong and will be,",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","a source of strength in this situation.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","So people put cash in—on deposit at the banks,",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","and they reached the limit of how—how much they could grow or made loans—you know,",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","they—companies drew down loans and deposited cash.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","So we gave some leverage ratio relief earlier by temporarily—it’s temporary relief—by eliminating,",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","Treasuries from the calculation of the—of the leverage ratio.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","This is a—this is another additional thing to do.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","If Congress chooses to do this, we would want it to be explicitly temporary.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","We—in other words, this will not be a permanent change in capital standards.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","but it would give us the ability to allow banks to grow their balance sheet and,",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","to serve their customers better.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","many bank regulators around the world have given leverage ratio relief.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","it’s allowing them to grow their balance sheet in a way that serves their customers.",""
"2020-07-29","Q&A","That—that’s really what it’s doing.",""

"2020-09-16","Opening Statement","as we articulated in our Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy.",""
"2020-09-16","Opening Statement","We view maximum employment as a broad-based and inclusive goal and do not see a high level of employment as posing a policy concern unless accompanied by signs of unwanted increases in inflation or the emergence of other risks that could impede the attainment of our goals.",""

"2020-09-16","Opening Statement","over coming months we will continue to increase our “holdings of Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities at least at the current pace.” These asset purchases are intended “to sustain smooth market functioning and help foster accommodative financial conditions,",""

"2020-09-16","Opening Statement","we “would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of our [the Committee’s] goals.” The Federal Reserve has also been taking broad and forceful actions to more directly support the flow of credit in the economy for households,",""

"2020-09-16","Q&A","One thing I would say is that financial—that monetary policy should not be the first line of defense—is not the first line of defense on financial stability.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","We look to more appropriate tools in the first instance as a first line of defense,",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","and those would be regulation,",""

"2020-09-16","Q&A","All of those things are, are really the first line of defense on financial stability.",""

"2020-09-16","Q&A","does a majority of the Committee feel that,",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","And that, that would be—that would be the test.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","And, you know, it’s not something that we’ve done.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","We do monitor financial stability concerns, of course, intensely and regularly.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","We try to use our other tools on them,",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","we do keep them in mind as we think about monetary policy.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","looking at everything we know about inflation dynamics in the United States and around the world over recent decades,",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","we expect it will take some time.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","We expect that the economy will recover quickly now,",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","but that that pace will slow as,",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","And we’ll still have an area of the economy—a big area of the economy—that struggles.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","There will be slack in the economy.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","The economy will be below that inflation will come back, generally.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","And, I mean, that’s sort of what happened during the last long expansion.",""

"2020-09-16","Q&A","Inflation does move up over time.",""

"2020-09-16","Q&A","We think that—that effectively saying that policy will remain highly accommodative until the economy is very far along in its recovery should provide strong support for the economy and get us there sooner rather than later.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","if you look at the Summary of Economic Projections that my colleagues and I filed for this meeting,",""

"2020-09-16","Q&A","In terms of fiscal policy—you asked about fiscal policy.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","one thing—I guess I would start by saying that the initial response from fiscal authorities was rapid.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","It was business equipment spending,",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","and the fact that businesses are staying in business,",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","the pace of default and things like that has really slowed.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","So there’s been a really positive effect.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","That said, my sense is that more fiscal support is likely to be needed.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","Of course, the details of that are for Congress, not for the Fed.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","there are still roughly 11 million people still out of work due to the pandemic,",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","and a good part of those people were working in industries that are likely to struggle.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","Those people may need additional,",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","additional support as they try to find their way through what will be a difficult time for them.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","We’ve also got struggling small businesses,",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","especially those in the business of facing directly to the public.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","And we have state and local governments dealing with a drop in revenue at the same time spending has gone up,",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","much of it related to the pandemic and economic effects.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","the fiscal support has been essential in,",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","in the good progress we see now.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","I’ll note that just about all—the overwhelming majority of,",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","who project an ongoing recovery are assuming there will be substantial additional fiscal support.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","maximum employment is not—is not something that can be reduced to a number the way inflation can.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","It’s a broad range of factors.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","It really always has been and,",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","a substantial number of factors that we’ve indicated we would look at.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","So it’s broader labor conditions, consistent with our Committee’s assessment of maximum at a rule.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","We’re looking at a judgmental assessment,",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","which I think we’ll be very transparent about as we—as we go forward.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","this is a Committee that is both confident and committed to—and determined to reach our goals.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","And the idea that we would look for the,",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","the quickest way out is just—it’s just not who we are.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","It’s not that—there’s no message of that here.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","We would not be looking for one month of 2 percent inflation;",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","we said return to 2—to achieve 2 percent inflation.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","we’re strongly committed to achieving our goals and the overshoot.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","So that should tell you about that.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","Oh, in terms of—okay, in terms of—so, what does “moderate” mean?",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","It doesn’t—it means not very high above 2 percent.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","I think that’s a fairly well-understood word.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","In terms of—in terms of “for a time,” what it means is not permanently and not for a sustained period.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","we’re resisting the urge to try to create some sort of a rule or a formula here.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","And I think the, the public will understand pretty well what we want.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","We want to achieve inflation that averages 2 percent over time.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","inflation expectations will be right at 2 percent,",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","and that’ll help us achieve 2 percent inflation over time and avoid the situation where the central bank loses its ability to support the economy.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","so I think what we’ve done is—is more or less aligned with the consensus statement today.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","So it’s, it’s in line with what, what might have been expected.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","I think over time it will provide very powerful support for this economy as we move forward.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","so I don’t—I’m not looking for a big reaction right now.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","guidance that we expect to retain the current stance until the economy is—has moved very far toward our goals is a strong and powerful thing.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","And I think that will be supportive of the economy over time.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","In terms of additional fiscal support,",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","and different participants in the FOMC made different assessments on their own.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","there is an expectation among private forecasters and among FOMC participants that there will be some further fiscal action.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","And there does seem to be an appetite on the part of all the relevant players to doing something.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","The question is, how much and when?",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","And so I would just say that if—and it’s very hard to say.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","so far the economy has proven resilient to the—to the lapsing of the—to the,",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","of the CARES Act unemployment— enhanced unemployment benefits.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","that those who are unemployed have saved—appear to have saved some of those benefits,",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","if there’s no follow-up on that,",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","if there isn’t additional support and there isn’t a job for the—some of those people who are,",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","things that will scar and damage the economy.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","when and how much and what will be the—what will be the contents?",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","no one—no one has any certainty around that,",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","then there would certainly be downside risks through the— certainly through the channel I mentioned.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","So we—you know, we monitor everything we think is important in the",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","we think our—we think that our asset purchases are doing both the thing—both those things today.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","We think, clearly, there’s been great progress, in terms of market function.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","early in the spring when the acute phase of the $120 billion a month—you know,",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","the last asset purchase program during the Global Financial Crisis and the recovery therefrom—we think that that’s also providing accommodative financial conditions and supporting growth.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","we—there are ways we can adjust that,",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","to do various things—you know,",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","and also target different sectors of the—of the curve.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","we’re going to continue to monitor developments,",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","and we’re prepared to adjust our plans as appropriate.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","what’s happening is basically we’re learning to live with—right now,",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","we're learning to live with COVID,",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","And we’re learning to, to engage in economic activity.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","All of this recovery that we’ve seen is in a context where—you know,",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","where people are still at risk of,",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","and yet we’re able to resume lots and lots of economic activities.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","you know—I think the more social distancing we can preserve as we go back into the workforce—wearing masks,",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","that kind of thing—the better we’ll be able to get economic activity usage and is,",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","And those are the ones where people were getting really closely—close together.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","I also think testing—to the extent you have cheap and rapid testing,",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","you can do a lot with that in the workforce.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","You can—you can build confidence in the workforce if you have regular—very regular testing that doesn’t cost very much and you get the results really quickly.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","you’ll be able to open a lot of workforces,",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","particularly in cities where the overall case numbers are quite low.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","we’re going to be finding lots and lots of ways to get out towards—you know,",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","There’s always going to be that—for,",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","there’s going to be certain activities that will be—that will be hard to,",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","So I, I think that’s the only way I can say it.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","And I think trying to—you know,",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","we all—when we make a forecast,",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","we make assessments about that,",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","There’s no—you know, there’s no experience with this.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","So, frankly, for the last 60 days or so, the economy’s recovered faster than expected.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","And I think we should do those things that we control to make sure that we can recover as quickly as possible.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","is wearing a mask and keeping your distance while you’re in the workforce.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","That’s something we can all do that will limit the spread and let people go back to work,",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","with you—nothing, really, that I can say that’s—on that today.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","I don’t have anything for you.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","So, a couple things about Main Street.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","It, it reaches the whole nation.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","It’s got more than half of the banking industry assets signed up among the banks that are part of it,",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","The number is more like—it’s close to $2 billion now.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","Banks are joining; borrowers are coming.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","It’s, it’s find that, that firms are not citing credit constraints as a top problem.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","And that, that is a lot of PPP, bank credit lines, and syndicated loans.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","There’s a lot of credit being let out there.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","We, we are looking at some things.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","We’re looking at—some lenders are concerned about the underwriting expectations.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","So banks are going to—their approach is likely to be that they’re going to underwrite this loan roughly the same as they underwrite any loan.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","what we want to do is make sure that—that they know that they should take the payment deferrals and other things in,",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","for companies or borrowers that,",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","to “regular way” borrowing now.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","Otherwise, why would we need Main Street?",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","So that’s what we're working on.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","And we’ll be doing some, some—we’ll be making some changes in that respect.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","I don’t—I saw what President Rosengren said.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","I, I can’t really comment directly on that.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","I just would say that, you know, this is 13(3).",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","If you look at the law under section 13(3),",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","it’s very clear that we are to make loans only to solvent borrowers.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","and the CARES Act is quite specific in keeping all of the terms of,",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","including the requirement that we,",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","gather good evidence that the borrower is solvent.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","This was—this law was amended in,",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","was to make it challenging and put hurdles in place before we made loans—at the time,",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","So now we—now we’re using that same law for,",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","it doesn’t—it’s not a perfect fit.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","to make it more broadly available—make it pretty much to any company that needs it and that can service a loan.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","I don’t—I don’t know about that.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","I haven’t heard those reports.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","we’re going to have to go through the banking system to do this.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","We—we’re not going to have a hundred thousand or a million loan officers working for the Fed and the Treasury.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","So we’re going to go through the banking system,",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","and the banks—banks like to make good loans.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","They’re trained to make good loans.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","So you should expect that they—and we expect that they will do some underwriting.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","We also want them to take some risk,",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","because that was the point of it.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","And the question is, how do you dial that in?",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","It’s, it’s not an easy thing to do.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","we’re getting some loans made,",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","that we’ll clarify this and that credit will continue to flow.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","we can’t be—we can’t be really sure we know the answers to those questions.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","But I would say, the, the likely path is that the—that the expansion will continue.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","and it’ll move most easily through the parts of the economy—it’ll still take some time,",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","but the parts of the economy that weren’t exactly directly affected,",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","that didn’t involve getting people in large groups together to feed them,",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","things like that—those are going to be the places that are—that are very challenging.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","So there will also be the—you know, the places that are affected that way.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","And that’s going to be challenging for, for some time.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","And we don’t really know how long that will be.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","It’s—you know, it’s millions of people.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","we had 11 million—something like 11 million people in the payroll survey have gone back to work out of 22 million who went—who lost their jobs in March and April.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","11 million— particularly if the pace of,",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","of returning to work slows down,",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","it’s going to leave a large—a large group of people.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","And it’ll be very meaningful from a macroeconomic standpoint.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","And our commitment is not to forget those people.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","the sense of our forward guidance is that policy will remain,",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","highly accommodative until the— until the expansion is well along—really,",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","we will keep policy accommodative until we actually have a moderate overshoot of inflation for some time.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","So those are powerful commitments that we think will,",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","will support the full recovery,",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","Well, no, I wouldn’t—I certainly would not say that we’re out of ammo.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","So, first of all, we, we do have lots of tools.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","and we’ve got further forward guidance—further forward guidance.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","So we, we—there’s still plenty more that we can do.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","We do think that our—that our,",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","our rate policy stance is an appropriate one to support the economy.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","this is the kind of guidance that will provide support for the economy over time,",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","the idea being that policy will remain highly accommodative until the recovery is well along—really,",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","very close to our goals—and then will remain accommodative even after we lift off.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","So I think that’s, that’s a really strong place for, for rate policy to be.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","But, again, we have the other margins that we can still use.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","Certainly, we’re not out of ammo.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","You know, so, of course we monitor financial conditions very carefully.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","These are—these are not new questions.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","These were questions that were very much in the air a decade ago and more when,",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","when the Fed first started doing QE.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","if you look at the long experience of,",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","the longest in our housing bubble or some kind of a bubble,",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","the popping of which could threaten the expansion.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","And, frankly, it hasn’t really happened around the world since then.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","That doesn’t mean that it won’t happen,",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","it’s something that we monitor carefully.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","we started a new—a whole division of the Fed to focus on financial stability.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","We look at it in every—from every perspective.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","The FOMC gets briefed on a quarterly basis.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","we talk about it more or less on an ongoing basis,",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","so it is something we monitor.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","But I don’t know that the—that the connection between asset purchases and,",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","and financial stability is a particularly tight one.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","So—but again, we won’t be—we won’t be just assuming that.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","We’ll be checking carefully as we go.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","the kinds of tools that we would use to address those sorts of things are not really monetary policy.",""

"2020-09-16","Q&A","So, I mean, I think the overall picture—take a step back from this.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","and that is that the labor market has been recovering,",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","but that it’s a long way—a long way from maximum employment.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","I think that’s, that’s the bottom line on it.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","claims—that’s a new system that had to be set up.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","The actual counting of the claims is,",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","and it’s very difficult to take much signal about the particular level.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","because people were setting those systems up,",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","and when they got them set up,",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","they counted them all at once and things like that.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","what you’ve seen is that the level of—certainly the level of initial claims has declined very sharply from the very high levels of March and April and is now at a lower level—continues either to be flat or gradually decline.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","It’s worth noting—and that’s good—it’s worth noting that that level is maybe five times the level of what claims were.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","Claims were around 200,000; now they’re 900,000, in that range, weekly for, for initial claims.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","the labor market has improved,",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","long way from maximum employment,",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","and it will be some time getting back there.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","I think that’s the best way to think about it.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","In many parts of the economy there’s just a lot of disruption,",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","it’s really hard to say precisely where we are.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","I’ll give you another example with—you know, we say unemployment’s 8.4 percent.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","But if you count those who are—who are misidentified as,",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","as employed when they’re actually unemployed and you add back some part of the participation number—so if you were—if you had a job and you were in the labor force in February and you lost it because of the pandemic,",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","some of you are now being reported as out of the labor force.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","But I—you know, I would—I would more look at those people as unemployed.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","If you add those back, the level of unemployment’s probably 3 percent higher.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","On the other hand, by that metric, the, the",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","I can’t be precise about a particular number,",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","there was a lot to like about 3½ percent unemployment.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","No one would say that number is the touchstone or that is,",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","I would just say, you asked about 3½ percent.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","A 3½ percent unemployment rate showed,",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","gains being shared very widely across the income spectrum—in fact,",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","going more to people at the bottom end of the spectrum.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","It showed labor force participation coming up as—up above many estimates of its trend,",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","as people who’d been out of the labor force were being pulled into a tight job market.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","There’s a lot to like about a tough—a tight job market,",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","particularly in a world where we didn’t see inflation.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","So, yes, we’d love to get back to that.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","we would like to get back—rather than to a particular number,",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","we’d like to get back to a strong labor market where wages are moving up,",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","where labor force participation is holding up nicely.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","That’s what we’d really love to get back to.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","Now, of course we would—we need inflation to perform in line with, with our framework.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","we think we can have quite low unemployment without raising troubling inflation.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","a substantial group of researchers who really cover the waterfront.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","And we do a significant amount of research on racial disparities in—across multiple variables,",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","we have our Division of Consumer and Community Affairs,",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","which is present in communities around the country.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","And the Reserve Banks all have very active community affairs groups.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","They’re present in communities around the country.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","So it wasn’t just the Fed—Fed Listens events.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","over a long period of time we,",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","we are in contact with people in those communities to understand their experience of the economy.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","We serve all Americans, and we know that.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","And we’re going to use our tools to, to reflect that fact.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","So the answer is “yes.” We do quite a bit of research,",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","and I suppose we could do more,",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","And we contribute to those fields and those assessments of,",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","And we do that not just because it’s interesting and important,",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","but because it’s important for the economy and important for our mandate.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","We are assigned “maximum employment.” Now, what does that mean?",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","As I mentioned earlier, it doesn’t mean a particular headline unemployment number.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","What it means is maximum employment.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","we look at—look at that in many,",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","and we ask ourselves whether those variables are—those labor market conditions are consistent with our assessments of what would constitute maximum employment.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","And that would include all of the things that we’re talking about.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","I wouldn’t—I don’t want to comment particularly on,",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","That’s their—they’re not they’re sort of on, on two sides of the, of the discussion.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","I am blessed —with having a Committee of highly thoughtful people who bring diverse life experiences and diverse careers,",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","And I wouldn’t have it any other way.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","the right—in our discussions the last couple of days,",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","everybody on the Committee is very supportive of the Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy and what’s in there—very,",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","the changes in the underlying economy and sees,",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","the need to address those—and including the changes we made to the employment mandate and to inflation so that we’re now at flexible average inflation targeting.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","there would be—this is—you know,",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","we’re the first major central bank to adopt this framework.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","There’s no cookbook, and we—you know, this is the first guidance under our new framework.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","of course there would be a wide range of views,",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","And it’s actually a healthy thing.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","You think today is a very good first step in doing that.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","It is strong, powerful guidance.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","It is—it ties in very nicely with the Statement of [on] Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","We had quite a robust discussion,",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","there are different ideas on how to do this,",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","that’s just the way it is when you have a diverse group of highly thoughtful and effective people.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","And so I’m pleased with where it came out.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","So thank you for that question.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","we’ve actually spent quite a bit of time on this as Secretary Mnuchin,",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","And I’ll say just a couple things.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","our facilities are essentially always—they have to be,",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","under the law—broad based and not so much targeting any single sector.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","it’s important to remember that CRE,",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","benefits from several of our existing facilities.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","So the TALF takes commercial mortgage-backed securities and SBA commercial real estate deals.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","And the New York Fed purchases agency CMBSs directly.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","In addition, I would say, Main Street helps businesses pay their rent, you know.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","in a number of other ways—commercial real estate.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","covenants—uniformly, I think, have covenants that forbid them to take on more debt.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","and you have a situation where,",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","where you—without a legal change or some kind of an innovation that defies discovery so far,",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","you’re—you have a hard time providing mass relief with regard to real estate that’s in,",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","it may be that further support for commercial real estate will require further action for Congress—from Congress.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","and I actually spoke about that in my Jackson Hole remarks a couple weeks ago.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","It is intuitive that, that high inflation is a bad thing.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","It’s less intuitive that inflation can be too low.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","And the way I would explain it is,",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","is that inflation that’s too low will mean that interest rates are lower.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","There’s an expectation of future inflation that’s built into every interest rate, right?",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","And to the extent inflation gets lower and lower and lower,",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","interest rates get lower and lower.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","And then the Fed will have less room to cut rates to support the economy.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","And this isn’t some idle, you know, academic theory.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","This is what’s happening all over the world.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","many large jurisdictions around the world,",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","you are seeing that phenomenon.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","And that’s just—that’s all we want.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","So we’re not looking to have high inflation.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","We just want inflation to average 2 percent.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","as has happened now—it moves down well below 2 percent.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","And that means that we’ve said for,",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","for—we would like to see and we will conduct policies so that inflation moves,",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","So it won’t be—these won’t be large overshoots,",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","and they won’t be permanent but to help anchor inflation expectations at 2 percent.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","So, yes, it’s, it’s a challenging concept for a lot of people.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","But, nonetheless, the economic importance of it is, is large.",""
"2020-09-16","Q&A","those are the people we’re serving,",""

"2020-11-05","Q&A","And, you know, as you know, these—we’re buying $120 billion a month.",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","That’s $1.44 trillion, if I remember my times tables.",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","And it’s just providing a lot of support for,",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","removing just about the same amount of duration risk from private hands as QE3 did.",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","So this is a big program, and it’s doing a lot of good.",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","we had a full discussion of the options around quantitative ease—not quantitative easing,",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","the ways in which we can adjust the parameters of it to deliver more accommodation if it turns out to be appropriate.",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","we think that this very large,",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","effective program is delivering about the right amount of accommodation and support for the markets,",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","So you did—you laid out nicely the,",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","the risks of damage to the supply side of the economy,",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","And we’ve been talking about those since the very beginning of the pandemic.",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","people are out of the labor force for an extended period of time.",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","They lose their attachment to the labor force, and it’s harder to get back.",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","if you don’t get back in very fairly quickly,",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","it can be harder to get back in.",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","And that holds down the whole economy.",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","it also—it places enormous burdens on individuals who may have this happen to them at an important stage in their career.",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","So it’s, it’s, it’s important.",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","you know—so that is one of the reasons why our response was so strong and so urgent at the beginning and why we called this,",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","I don’t know how we could be much more vocal about it than we have been.",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","the economic recovery has exceeded,",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","the downside cases that we were very concerned about and even,",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","even exceeded—sort of exceeded the baseline expectations.",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","We are a long way from our goals.",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","we’re sort of halfway there on the labor market recovery at best.",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","and there are parts of the economy where it’s going to be hard until there’s a vaccine—you know,",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","So, you know, that’s the supply-side damage.",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","That’s sort of the third thing that we talk about.",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","The first, at the beginning, it was to provide relief and comfort.",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","The second—then the second part was to I think we have been vocal.",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","You know, we’ll, we’ll try to continue to do that.",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","and those are—that’s again—that goes to keeping this episode as short as it can be and avoiding unnecessary business bankruptcies,",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","and unnecessary long- term stays of unemployment or supporting people through them so that they can maintain their financial footing and their lives and be able to go back to work in a productive way.",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","it’s very important that—you know,",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","there is a real threat here of those things,",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","we’re trying to do everything we can to minimize that threat.",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","we do think that the facilities have,",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","have generally served their purposes well,",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","particularly in supporting the flow of credit,",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","particularly acting as backstops to private markets.",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","So, overall, we think that the, the programs have, have gone well.",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","In terms of the extension, we are, we are just now turning to that question.",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","You know, we’ve had a lot of things to work our way through.",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","Right now we’re just in the process of turning to that question and,",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","we have to make and will make jointly with the Treasury Department.",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","I take the sense of your first question to be,",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","is monetary policy out of power or out of ammo?",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","And the answer to that would be “no,” I don’t think that.",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","I think—I think that we are strongly committed to using these powerful tools that we have to support the economy during this difficult time for as long as needed,",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","and no one should have any doubt about that.",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","And we do not doubt the power of the things that we’ve already done or the things that we may,",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","I do think there’s more that can be done.",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","if you look at the stock of assets that we’ve bought,",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","if you look at the facilities and,",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","and the way we’ve been able to keep accommodative financial— financial conditions accommodative,",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","I think we’ve been able to do a lot of things that are I’ve said—we’ve said from the very beginning,",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","that this is particular—that the particular situation we find ourselves in is one where there is a sudden loss of income on,",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","on the part of millions and tens of millions of people.",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","It’s not so much a typical recession where demand weakens,",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","It’s a sudden shock where tens of millions of people are out of work.",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","very good and very robust in the United States.",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","And it’s certainly one of the main reasons why the recovery has been as good as it’s been so far.",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","So I do think fiscal policy is absolutely essential here.",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","stimulating aggregate demand is one thing,",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","but where there’s a part of the economy that kind of will be resistant to that,",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","And, of course, you need health-care policy too.",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","I didn’t see Madame Lagarde’s comments this morning,",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","I took the sense of that question to be the spread of the disease in Europe,",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","and what do we think about that?",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","So, as I mentioned in my—in my opening remarks, it’s a concern.",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","We have a widespread spike in cases across the country,",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","more in some regions than others.",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","And even if we don’t have—and I don’t expect that we would—sort of government-imposed restrictions,",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","that people who have maybe begun to engage in activities that they had in flying,",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","that they may pull back in a situation where suddenly the cases are everywhere in your city,",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","So I do think that that’s a risk that we have as we go into the fall now and,",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","That, that could weigh on economic activity.",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","One would expect that it would.",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","about the wave we had this summer in the South and the West.",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","And the risk, as I did in my—in my comments.",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","our main focus is on doing our job,",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","and that is really what we’re,",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","we’re focused on is using the tools that Congress has given us and the assignment they’ve given us.",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","And I think we’re, we’re—that is the thing that we think about night and day.",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","from the experience of the last cycle,",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","it helps to have the whole government working on these things,",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","and this one is particularly that way.",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","I don’t want to say whether I feel like I’m being heard or not.",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","I think there are plenty of people on Capitol Hill who,",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","who see a need for further fiscal action and understand perfectly why that might be the case.",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","So I don’t really have a specific hypothetical I would—I would put to you.",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","we understand that there are a number of parameters that we have where we can shift the composition,",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","are available to us as ways to deliver addition—you know,",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","more accommodation if we think that’s appropriate.",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","Right now, we, we like the amount of accommodation the program is, is delivering.",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","And it will just depend on the—on the facts and circumstances.",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","We may reach a view at some point that we need to do more on that front.",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","Today’s meeting was about analyzing the—one of the things it was about was about analyzing the various ways and having a,",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","good discussion about how to think about those,",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","I thought was quite a useful discussion.",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","we really are just turning to this issue now,",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","and we have not made any decisions.",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","we are just getting started on it,",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","and it’s a decision that we’ll make jointly with the Treasury Department.",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","And that’s, that’s really all I can say today.",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","That’s all I have for you on that today.",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","I think clearly the tail risks that we were worried about have,",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","And, you know, we were worried about very negative potential outcomes.",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","that’s—what is to be expected of us is,",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","is to think about how things can go wrong as well as the way things that can go right.",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","But we, we have to—we do make policy from a risk-management standpoint.",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","We don’t just look at the most likely case.",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","“How do you make policy in light of the risks?” and often it’s downside risks in a situation like this.",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","I would not say that anybody’s feeling comfortable about this, though.",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","we’ve gotten through the first five,",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","six months of the—of the expansion better than expected,",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","but we do see in Europe—look what’s happening in Europe,",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","look what’s happening here—another spike in cases as the cold weather arrives and people are inside more.",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","So I think we have to be humble about where we are relative to this—to this disease.",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","research on vaccines are advancing,",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","we are so— we’re very far from saying that we think we’ve got this and eliminated the tail risks.",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","have diminished since—at least our perception of them has diminished since earlier in the year.",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","So let me say why it’s such an important—you know,",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","in a world where so many payments are made digitally and all that,",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","coins and currency are very important for the relatively low-income people.",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","And so it’s a really incredibly important part of the payment system,",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","and we do pay a lot of attention to it.",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","And I actually just—I just caught up this morning with the—with the person who heads that operation here who,",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","things have really gotten significantly better on the coin front.",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","So we worked very hard to increase the supply of coins and,",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","the distribution of coins around the System and are happy to say that that situation is well on the way to normalizing itself.",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","So very pleased to report that.",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","to comment on the election directly,",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","other than just to say that it’s a good time to take a step back and let the institutions of our democracy do their jobs.",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","So, at the Fed here, we will, as discussions.",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","what we do is we talk about the economy and markets,",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","domestically and around the world.",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","We hear reports on how households and businesses are doing.",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","We talk about risks to the outlook.",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","We talk about what the right policy response might be.",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","And the election comes up in some—you know,",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","but it is not at all a central focus of the meeting.",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","So I, I’ll just leave it at that.",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","Again, very reluctant to get into anything more than that.",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","So, we have had very little demand below $1 million in loans.",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","And part of that just is that the fee structure is what it is,",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","and that’s the compensation that the banks get.",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","And there’s a certain amount of work that they have to do to get—to get into the loan program and do—and to document the thing,",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","the loans that they make because these are loans that,",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","They keep 5 percent, so they actually have to underwrite the credit.",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","And we’re relying on them, to some extent, for, for doing that.",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","We moved the minimum down to $250,000, and we were reluctant to go below that.",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","that it would be great if we could reduce it to $100,000.",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","So—and, you know, we’ve been saying we’d have to redesign the program.",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","I got the question in a—in an oversight hearing a month or so ago with the Secretary and said that.",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","program so that we could move to a lower level?",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","we concluded we could just change the fee structure to create incentives for that,",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","We want, you know, qualifying businesses to be able to borrow.",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","And we’ll see how much demand will come.",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","You know, with, with these programs, why did it—why didn’t we do it right away?",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","We tend to—it’s—there’s more work than one might—certainly than I imagined in setting up one of these facilities.",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","you just try to get it out there and get it working and not try to do everything before you start it because you’ll never start it if you do that.",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","Then you get it started, and you make changes.",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","And we’ve been willing to make changes.",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","That’s the most recent set of ones that we’ve done.",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","we hope—we hope that it will help some companies,",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","So when I say we’re not out of ammo,",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","the asset purchase program—there’s a number of dimensions in which we can adjust that if we deem it to be appropriate.",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","Right now, we like the job it’s doing.",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","if the facilities are extended,",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","we could certainly look at knows?",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","the facilities have been doing a lot of work and been very successful,",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","overall in accomplishing that job.",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","So I do think there, there are things that we can do.",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","we’ve always said this will take a whole of government approach,",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","including health-care policy and fiscal policy too.",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","if you—if you want to get the economy back as quickly as possible to where we want it to be,",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","then really it should be all of government working together.",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","the corporate—the larger corporate market-based lending program has been very successful without making a single loan—I think,",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","I think the success—I think the state and local government program has also restored market function so that—whereas,",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","the sort of individual investors who wind up funding loans in the muni market through.",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","they had withdrawn a lot of money,",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","and that—we’ve had many weeks of consecutive,",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","and you’re largely back to a normal functioning market.",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","I think that’s also been a success.",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","I think the other—certainly the, the funding market programs have been a big success.",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","were a great way to reach smaller companies.",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","what you hear out there is that demand—you talk to banks,",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","and they’ll say demand for loans is very,",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","And, and the reason is that, you know, activity’s at a relatively low level.",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","They don’t want to run up their debt.",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","we put an awful lot into Main Street,",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","and it is very challenging to reach a lot of those companies.",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","we are reaching many of them now,",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","and I hope that the new changes will help us reach more.",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","You know, so I’m going to take your question literally.",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","And so if the idea is money-financed fiscal policy,",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","that’s not something that we would consider.",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","So that— what I mean by that is,",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","the central bank is really funding fiscal activities of the government fairly directly.",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","No, that’s not something we do.",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","That separation between those jobs is absolutely critical in our system of government.",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","with a specific set of tools to support maximum employment,",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","supervise banks—all the things we’re assigned to do.",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","we’re not going to get into financing the government and,",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","doesn’t change the amount of government debt outstanding.",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","to purchase a Treasury security,",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","and that’s just another form—on the consolidated balance sheet of the federal government,",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","You change the—you change the,",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","but not the total quantity of debt that the government has when you do these asset purchase programs.",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","So I don’t know exactly what you’re referring to.",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","to take your question literally about financing fiscal activity,",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","it’s really not something that we think the central bank should do and,",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","and not something we’re looking at.",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","we’re doing that with the Municipal Liquidity Facility now,",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","with our own funds and with the CARES Act funds that,",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","that we’ve gotten through Congress and the Treasury.",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","We’re buying municipal securities of up to three years.",""

"2020-11-05","Q&A","which has to meet the emergency requirements of exigent circumstances and which is all clearly laid out in the law.",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","So we’re, we’re actually doing that now.",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","So we step in under 13(3), and we provide liquidity.",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","What turns out to happen is, we announce a program, and the market starts working.",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","So we only actually have to do a backstop.",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","The amount of financing that’s happened in the municipal markets this year is much higher than it was the prior year,",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","We did—we’ve done a very small number of, of loans.",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","But just the fact that we’re there as a backstop seems to—seems to get the private parties to get back together and,",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","and get the market working again.",""
"2020-11-05","Q&A","We’re not—that shouldn’t be a permanent thing where we’re just another federal financing agency that’s available to direct credit to—you know,",""

"2020-12-16","Q&A","with specific numbers at this point.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","So, really, the question is, what do we mean by, by that language?",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","is that our guidance for both interest rates and asset purchases will keep monetary policy accommodative until our maximum-employment and price-stability goals are achieved,",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","So “substantial further progress” means what it says.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","It means we’ll be looking for employment to be substantially closer to assessments of its maximum level and inflation to be substantially closer to our 2 percent longer-run goal before we start making adjustments to our purchases.",""

"2020-12-16","Q&A","There will come a time when the economy does not require increasing amounts of policy accommodation.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","And when that time comes—and that will be uncertain and,",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","So I can’t give you an exact set of numbers.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","We will—of when we would actually consider gradually tapering the pace of purchases.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","I would start with what we actually did at the meeting,",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","this guidance about the path of asset purchases.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","And I just went through what, what they—what they—the guidance that we put forward.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","so I guess since September we’ve now adopted a flexible average inflation-targeting framework.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","We have provided rate guidance that is tightly linked to the goals as expressed in that new framework.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","And now we’ve done the same for, for asset purchases.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","as the future has become clearer and as we’ve absorbed new developments in medical—in the medical sphere and also in,",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","we have—began to be able to see further.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","So we’ve, we’ve started to be able to provide further important guidance.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","And we think that the—that the asset purchase guidance, guidance is very important.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","We think that the, the prior language of “in coming months” was obviously temporary.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","to actual “substantial further progress” toward our,",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","And we think that that is important to have done.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","that we also continue to think that our current policy stance is appropriate.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","We think it’s providing a great deal of support for the economy.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","Financial conditions are highly accommodative.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","And, you know, we monitor a range of financial condition indexes.",""

"2020-12-16","Q&A","The parts of the economy that are weak are the service-sector businesses that involve close contact.",""

"2020-12-16","Q&A","but rather by the spread of the virus.",""

"2020-12-16","Q&A","I don’t—I wouldn’t want to sort of talk about hypothetical situations.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","we look at our overall stance of policy,",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","we look at overall financial conditions,",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","we look at what’s going on in the economy—different parts of the economy,",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","should we change our policy stance?",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","And we look at where financial conditions are now,",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","and we think—we happen to think it’s the right amount.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","you mentioned—I think you’re referring to the idea of maintaining the duration but,",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","which is sort of what the Bank of Canada did.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","that is something that we—you know,",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","that we talked about in the last meeting and was addressed in the minutes.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","Some thought it was an interesting idea,",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","I wouldn’t say that that’s something that’s,",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","So on your—on your first question, we really have not thought about that.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","We’re, we’re very focused on—we have a lot to do now.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","We, we have not focused on, on that question, and I, I really have nothing to add on that.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","No, we, we would have the ability—certainly, we would have the ability to do facilities under 13(3) in some cases with no backing.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","But we can’t do any 13(3) facilities of—during the Global Financial Crisis also didn’t have any.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","I would say that we are—you know, we’re—we have the authorities we have.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","We will use them if, if they’re needed and if—and if the law permits us to do so.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","We would—we would always do that.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","We, we do not have any plans for, for the future about this.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","We—we’re very focused on, on getting through year-end.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","We’ve been very focused on, on the issues that are right in front of us.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","And, honestly, we’re not—we’re not planning on anything or having any discussions about what we might do down the road.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","So on, on fiscal policy, I would just say a couple of things.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","The case for fiscal policy right now is, is very, very strong.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","And I think that is widely understood, I would say, now.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","The details of it are entirely up to Congress.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","But with the businesses to have, have fiscal support.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","And I do think that—again, I think that is widely understood.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","I certainly would welcome the work that Congress is doing right now.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","It’s not up to us to judge that work.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","And I, I don’t have a view for you on, on the size of it.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","It’s—you know, it’s obviously a substantial bill.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","On the surge, you know, so it’s a really interesting question.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","have consistently expected there to be more economic—that,",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","that cases would hold—growth in cases would hold back the economy more than it actually has.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","the effects on the economy of,",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","of these spikes we’ve been having.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","this spike is so much larger that I think—and I think forecasters generally do think that there—that this will have an effect on suppressing activity,",""

"2020-12-16","Q&A","on airplanes and hotels and things like that.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","And you’re starting to see that.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","In the—in the high-frequency data, you’re now beginning to see that show up.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","And I think if this is—the case numbers are so high and so widespread across the country that that,",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","that seems like it must happen.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","We don’t—we don’t really know.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","You know, there are—there are a lot of estimates.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","The general expectation is, you’re seeing some slowing now.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","And you’ll see the first quarter could well be—what,",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","what we said is that coming months are going to be challenging.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","The first quarter will, will certainly show significant effects from this.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","At the same time, people are getting vaccinated now.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","And by the end of the first quarter into the second quarter,",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","you’re going to be seeing significant numbers of people vaccinated.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","And so then what will be—how will that play into economic in a broader range of activities.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","And some people will be probably quick to do that.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","Some are doing it now without a vaccine—right?—in many parts of the country.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","my expectation—and I think many people have the expectation that the second half of next year should—the economy should be performing strongly.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","We should be— you know, we should be getting people back to work.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","Businesses should be reopening and that kind of thing.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","The issue is more the next four or five months—getting through the next four,",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","And, and, you know, clearly there’s going to be need for help there.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","And, and, you know, my sense and hope is that we’ll be getting that.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","so we monitor basically just about every asset price in the economy,",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","and housing prices are something that we’ve been monitoring.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","This, this is the housing market that people have been expecting since, you know, 2010.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","when the—when the pandemic hit,",""

"2020-12-16","Q&A","builders are going to bring forth supply.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","There’s also a sense that this—some of this may be pent-up demand from when the economy was closed,",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","which would imply that demand—once that demand is met,",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","that the real level of demand will be more manageable.",""

"2020-12-16","Q&A","I wouldn’t think that that’s an issue that we’d be concerned about.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","There is more that we can do, certainly.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","We can—we can expand our, our asset purchase programs.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","We can focus them more on the longer end.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","There are a number of options we would have to provide more support to the economy.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","the help that people need isn’t just from low interest rates that stimulates demand over time and works with long and variable lags.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","As the—as—we’ve, we’ve talked about this as all of these government across it.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","But there’s a group for, for which they, they don’t have a bridge yet.",""

"2020-12-16","Q&A","But it’s going to be a while before we really are back to the levels of,",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","the sort of conditions in the labor market that we had in early this year and for much of the last couple of years.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","So that’s how I think about it.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","of when the United States would reach herd immunity,",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","they’re going to be similar to what other people think.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","it depends on your assumptions,",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","such as how many people will actually take the vaccine and how fast will the rollout be.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","So it’s assumption based on assumption based on assumption.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","But, you know, sometime—it’s possible sometime in the middle or second half of next year.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","I’m not going to try to be precise, because it’s just another estimate.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","at the same data as other people are.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","And so, you know, all the estimates are—it depends on what your assumptions are.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","But under a normal set of assumptions,",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","as soon as the middle of next year.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","In terms of the, you know, inflation, a couple things—your second question.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","we’re—I think you have to be honest with yourself about,",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","There are—there are significant disinflationary pressures around the world,",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","and there have been for a while,",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","It’s, is not going to be easy to have inflation move up.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","And it isn’t going to be just a question—it’s going to take some time.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","It took a long time to get inflation back to 2 percent in the last crisis.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","high levels of asset purchases,",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","because that’s what we believe the underlying inflation dynamics are in our economy.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","And that’s sort of why we’re—one reason why we’re concerned about inflation is that we see that.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","And, and that’s why we have adopted the flexible average inflation-targeting framework.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","That’s why we’re aiming for an overshoot.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","we’re honest with ourselves and with the public that it will take some time to get there.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","would it really speed it up a lot to,",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","I don’t think that would really be—I think it’s going to take a long time however you do it.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","we’ve been having very long expansions since—in,",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","in the last several decades because inflation has not—really,",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","inflation would come along and the Fed would tighten,",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","Now inflation has been low, and we haven’t had that dynamic.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","And the result has been three of the four longest expansions in,",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","we’re thinking that this could be another long expansion,",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","and that we’ll keep our—what we’re saying is,",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","we’re going to keep policy highly accommodative until the expansion is well down the tracks.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","And we’re not going to preemptively raise rates until we see inflation actually reaching 2 percent and being on track to exceed 2 percent.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","That’s a very strong commitment, and we think that’s the right place to be.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","the Network [of Central Banks and Supervisors] for Greening the Financial System,",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","And I’ll just—I’ll just say a couple things about that.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","I’ll just start by saying that we’re going to move carefully and thoughtfully on developing an understanding of how climate change affects our work,",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","including the areas you mentioned.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","We’re going to do so with a great deal of engagement with all of our external constituencies,",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","including the public and their elected representatives who are charged with our oversight.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","We’ll do it with great transparency.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","We’re not the forum where all the great issues of the day are to be hashed out,",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","and addressed unless and only to the extent that those issues are directly relevant to our statutory goals and are addressable through our legal authorities.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","And because we have a narrow remit,",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","Congress has given us a precious grant of independence from direct political control.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","So society’s broad response to climate change is for others to decide—in particular, elected leaders.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","But—so let me—let me get to your question.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","What does all that mean for an issue like climate change?",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","So Congress hasn’t explicitly assigned us or other financial regulators a role,",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","and we’re not among the agencies who contribute to the National Climate Assessment—Climate Assessment,",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","But climate change is nonetheless relevant to our existing mandates under the law.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","One of our jobs is to regulate and supervise banks and to look after the stability of the financial system.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","That’s a responsibility we share with other agencies.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","The public will expect that we will—we will do that.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","that those important institutions will be resilient against the many resists—risks that they fake—face:",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","Climate change is an emerging risk to financial institutions, the financial system, and the economy.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","in the very early stages of understanding what that means,",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","what needs to be done about it,",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","That’s why 83 central banks have joined together to share research and identify best practices in this important emerging area.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","We’ve been attending NGFS meetings as an observer for more than a year,",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","We had discussed that it was probably time to join as a member.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","just beginning to develop our, our understanding.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","You asked about monetary policy.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","We, we have historically shied away strongly from taking a role in credit allocation.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","our agreement with Treasury during the financial crisis from back in 2009 or ’10 says that we will avoid credit allocation.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","It’s something we’ve carefully avoided.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","I would be very reluctant to see us move in that direction,",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","picking one area as creditworthy and another not.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","So you asked about monetary policy.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","I would say the real—the real concern is—the real place to focus,",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","is supervision of financial institutions and then financial stability concerns.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","You can see a connection there.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","Monetary policy, maximum employment, stable prices—it’s less obvious to me.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","you know—I can make the argument,",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","but it’s less obvious to me that those should be first-order things that we would look at in connection with climate change.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","But I think there’s—I think there’s work to be done to understand the connection between climate change and the strength and resilience of financial markets and financial institutions.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","I think that work is in its early days.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","We’ll be thorough and transparent and, and engage with the public on all that.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","So the state and local governments,",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","they provide important critical services:",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","all kinds of things like that.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","they’re really involved in people’s lives,",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","state and local governments are,",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","to provide more fiscal support to them is entirely in the hands of Congress.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","they’re in the middle of these discussions,",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","those are issues for them to decide.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","I would say that the picture is mixed.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","if you’re a state that has a significant exposure to tourism or to extracting energy from the ground—oil from the ground,",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","feeling a significant loss of revenue.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","A number of other states have been surprised on the upside,",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","where—and that’s because goods sales,",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","for example—property taxes are—don’t move much year to year.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","And, you know, the kind of sales taxes on goods—goods sales have been very high.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","Income has been more or less replaced by,",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","by the CARES Act—fully replaced,",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","So the concerns that we had at the very beginning of really serious,",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","deep shortfalls and massive budget cuts on the part of state and local governments have not yet—have not yet occurred.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","What we’re seeing is, is that it’s different state to state.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","And some states are having significant difficulties, others not so much.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","state and local governments are very large employers,",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","employment has lost their jobs during the Global Financial Crisis.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","So that is—that is a significant—a significant part of that group is, is in education.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","a significant part of that 1.3 million would go back to work.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","we’re watching carefully to understand why that—why that many people have been let go and what are—really are the sources.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","So we’re monitoring it carefully, and it’s a mixed picture.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","I just have to leave the question of what to do with fiscal policy on this to Congress.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","very large asset purchase program.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","It’s providing a tremendous amount of, of support for the economy.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","If you look at the interest-sensitive parts of the economy, they’re performing very well.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","The parts that are not performing well are not struggling from high So,",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","we do have the ability to—you know,",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","to buy more bonds or to buy longer-term bonds.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","And, and we may—we may use it.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","I’m not saying we won’t—we won’t use that.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","It may well come to, to using that.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","I would remind—I would also note,",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","monetary policy works with “long and variable lags,” is the famous statement.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","So we think that the big effects from monetary policy are,",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","months and months into the future.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","So this looks like a—you know,",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","it looks like a time when what is really needed is fiscal policy.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","is a very positive thing that,",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","we remain open to doing—you know,",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","to either increasing the size of our asset purchases,",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","if that turns out to be appropriate,",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","or to just moving the maturities,",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","moving to buying longer maturities,",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","because that had—that also increases accommodation by taking more duration risk out of the market.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","But we think our current stance is appropriate.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","And we think that our— you know,",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","our guidance on asset purchases today will also provide support to the economy over time.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","what we’ve—what we’ve done is,",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","we’ve laid out a path whereby we’re going to keep monetary policy highly accommodative for a long time,",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","really until—really until we reach very close to our goals,",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","not really the way it’s been done in the past.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","So that’s, that’s providing significant support for the economy now.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","We don’t think the economy suffers from a lack of, of highly accommodative financial conditions.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","We think it’s suffering from the pandemic and people wanting to not engage in certain kinds of economic activity.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","And we expect that, that with the virus, that that will improve—that condition will improve.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","Nonetheless, again, we will—are prepared to use our",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","So that, that has all the markings of a transient increase in the price level.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","So you can imagine that as people really want to travel again—let’s say,",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","is a process whereby they go up year upon year upon year upon year.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","And if—given the inflation dynamics that we’ve had over the last several decades,",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","single sort of price-level increase has not resulted in ongoing price-level increases.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","that was—the problem back in the 1970s was,",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","it was the combination of two things.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","One, when unemployment went down and resources got tight, prices started going up.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","But the second problem was that that—that that increase was persistent,",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","there was a level of persistence.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","So if prices went up 6 percent this year,",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","they’d go up 6 percent next year,",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","people internalize that they can raise prices,",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","and that it’s okay to pay prices that are going up at that rate.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","So that was the inflation—those are the inflation dynamics of that era.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","there, but it’s a—it’s a faint heartbeat compared to what it was.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","And the persistence of inflation,",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","if you—if you get a—for example,",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","and that’ll send a temporary shock through the economy.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","The persistence of that into, into inflation over time is just not there.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","So they— what you describe may happen,",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","we would watch it very carefully.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","we understand that we will always be learning new things from the economy about how it will behave in certain cases.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","going in that that would be a one-time price increase rather than an increase in underlying inflation that would be persistent.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","So—you were breaking up a little.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","I think—I think I got the sense of it, though.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","I don’t think it’s at all a foregone conclusion that there needs to be a time when the economy needs highly accommodative monetary policy,",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","and we think our asset purchases are,",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","one of the main delivery mechanisms for that,",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","the size of the balance sheet.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","You know, there’s lots of demand for, for",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","we’ve had a—and I’ve had sort of the typical meetings with the transition team for Treasury.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","They’ve met with quite a lot of people in our agency and other agencies.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","And, really, it’s about learning what we do.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","I really have only spoken to former Chair Yellen to congratulate her on being nominated and just to say that I look forward to working with her.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","I did work very closely with her for five years before she left and have stayed in touch,",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","But I have not discussed, you know, policy with her.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","And I, I’m not going to do that until she’s confirmed.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","You, you were breaking up, but I, I think I got that.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","So, you know, financial stability—we, we look at a broad range of things.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","We actually have a framework so that we can,",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","be—evaluate changes in financial stability over time,",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","and so that the public can evaluate whether we’re doing a job—a good job at it.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","Asset prices is one thing that we look at.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","we published a report a few weeks ago on that—maybe it was month or so ago.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","And I think you’ll find a mixed bag there.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","it depends on whether you’re looking at P/Es or whether you’re looking at the premium over risk-free—over the risk-free return.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","in a world where the— where the risk-free rate is sustain—is going to be low for a sustained period,",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","which is really the reward you get for taking equity risk,",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","which would mean that they’re not overpriced in that sense.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","that’s maybe not as relevant in a world where we think the 10-year Treasury is going to be lower than it’s been historically,",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","from a—from a return perspective.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","You know, we look at—we also look at borrowing—leverage of financial institutions.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","We spent 10 years and the banks spent 10 years building up their capital.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","So far, they’ve been a leverage is high.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","But, you know, rates are really low.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","So—and so companies have been able to handle their debt loads even in weak periods,",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","because rates are— rates are quite low.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","Your interest payments are low.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","Defaults and downgrades have, have declined since earlier in the year.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","Households came into this very strong,",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","and there certainly has been a hit there for people who are unemployed.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","But, you know, with the CARES Act, Congress replaced a lot of lost income.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","You know, it’s very important that, that the economy gets strong again.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","I mean, the, the ultimate thing to support financial stability is a strong economy.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","The last thing is, is really funding markets.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","We found that there was a lot of unstable funding for companies, particularly financial companies.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","And that’s, that’s down to a—to a very low level these days.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","So the broad financial stability picture is, is kind of mixed, I would say.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","are a little high in that metric and in my view.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","But, overall, you have a mixed picture.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","You, you don’t have, you know, a lot of red flags on that.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","So—and it’s—again, it’s something that we monitor essentially ongoing, almost daily.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","we’re monitoring these prices for that and,",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","we’ll be held accountable for what we saw and what we missed.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","So people who—people who run for elected office and win,",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","they’re the ones—their reward is they get to make those very difficult decisions.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","And—you know, so we’re not charged with providing fiscal advice to, to Congress.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","as a general—as a general rule,",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","it is important to be on a sustainable fiscal path.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","For my way of thinking and many others’,",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","the time to focus on that is when the economy is strong and when unemployment is low and taxes are—you know,",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","there’s room to get on—get on a sustainable path,",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","because the economy’s really doing well.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","You’re still now in the—in the, you know, some part of, of an economic crisis.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","And the fact that Congress is debating a fairly large bill today suggests that,",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","suggests that something fairly substantial is going to get done,",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","we hope—that what’s being discussed is,",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","In terms of what is a sustainable level,",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","it’s—the question is—we’ve always looked at debt to GDP,",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","and we’re very high by that measure.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","By some other measures, we’re actually not that high.",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","you can look at the real interest rate payments,",""
"2020-12-16","Q&A","if you—if you sort of take real interest costs of the federal deficit and divide that by GDP,",""

"2021-01-27","Q&A","But—so I would just say that our—that there are many things that go in,",""
"2021-01-27","Q&A","So if you look at what’s really been driving asset prices,",""

"2021-01-27","Q&A","that’s one of the very difficult questions in all of monetary policy.",""
"2021-01-27","Q&A","And we don’t rule it out as a theoretical matter,",""
"2021-01-27","Q&A","we clearly look to macroprudential tools,",""

"2021-01-27","Q&A","the monetary policy we know strengthens economic activity and job creation through fairly well- understood channels.",""

"2021-01-27","Q&A","not theoretically ruled out but not something we,",""
"2021-01-27","Q&A","we—we’ve ever done and not something we would plan to do.",""
"2021-01-27","Q&A","We would rely on macroprudential and other tools to deal with financial stability issues.",""
"2021-01-27","Q&A","a couple of things—there are a couple of things that are worth mentioning.",""
"2021-01-27","Q&A","One is just that we know that we measure inflation on a trailing 12-month basis.",""
"2021-01-27","Q&A","And as we—as we lap the very low inflation readings of March and April of last year,",""
"2021-01-27","Q&A","we’ll see measured 12-month inflation move up a few tenths.",""
"2021-01-27","Q&A","This is just—they’re called base effects,",""
"2021-01-27","Q&A","and that’s a—that’s a transient thing that we think will pass.",""
"2021-01-27","Q&A","it’s in some forecasts—that as the economy fully reopens,",""
"2021-01-27","Q&A","there’ll be a burst of spending,",""
"2021-01-27","Q&A","and—because people will be enthusiastic that the pandemic is over,",""
"2021-01-27","Q&A","and that that could also create some upward pressure on inflation.",""
"2021-01-27","Q&A","we would see that as something likely to be transient and not to be very large.",""
"2021-01-27","Q&A","In both cases, we don’t see those as either lasting or particularly large.",""
"2021-01-27","Q&A","So the way we would react is, we’re going to be patient.",""
"2021-01-27","Q&A","Expect us to wait and see and not react if we see small and what we would review—we would view as very likely to be transient effects on inflation.",""

"2021-01-27","Q&A","And so we’re going to preserve an element of judgment.",""

"2021-01-27","Q&A","and/or President Biden since he has taken office.",""

"2021-01-27","Q&A","We’ll also have a good institutional relationship between the Fed and the Treasury.",""

"2021-01-27","Q&A","of the CRRA Act [Consolidated Appropriations Act,",""

"2021-01-27","Q&A","They’ve actually had—they have higher capital ratios now than they had at the beginning of the pandemic.",""

"2021-01-27","Q&A","housing is now—the level of housing activity is at its highest level since before the Global Financial Crisis,",""

"2021-01-27","Q&A","And that So you asked about corporate debt, I guess?",""
"2021-01-27","Q&A","So we, we monitor pretty much all of the big financial markets pretty carefully.",""
"2021-01-27","Q&A","beginning with the announcement of our corporate credit facility,",""
"2021-01-27","Q&A","you’ve seen lenders lending and borrowers borrowing.",""
"2021-01-27","Q&A","You’ve seen relatively significantly fewer defaults than we—than we expected.",""
"2021-01-27","Q&A","There were a lot of downgrades and some defaults at the beginning,",""
"2021-01-27","Q&A","and those have really slowed down.",""
"2021-01-27","Q&A","And, by the way, the same is true for bank loans.",""
"2021-01-27","Q&A","Banks are not experiencing the kinds of defaults that,",""
"2021-01-27","Q&A","that we all were concerned about in the early months of the pandemic.",""
"2021-01-27","Q&A","So they’re having to reverse some of their loss reserves, actually.",""
"2021-01-27","Q&A","Debts—corporate debt spreads are, are tight.",""
"2021-01-27","Q&A","at the—during the acute phase of the pandemic,",""
"2021-01-27","Q&A","they’re now at the lower end of their typical range.",""
"2021-01-27","Q&A","it’s not something we can control or operate on directly,",""
"2021-01-27","Q&A","but we do—we do watch those things.",""
"2021-01-27","Q&A","it’s good that companies have been able to finance themselves during this period,",""
"2021-01-27","Q&A","because they—they’ve been able to stay in business.",""
"2021-01-27","Q&A","They’ve been able to keep their employees working.",""
"2021-01-27","Q&A","And, you know, that’s a good thing.",""
"2021-01-27","Q&A","And that’s, that’s part of highly accommodative financial conditions.",""
"2021-01-27","Q&A","You know, the, the, the big thing is that the jury’s out.",""
"2021-01-27","Q&A","And this has been a concern since the very beginning,",""
"2021-01-27","Q&A","is the concern that people—if,",""
"2021-01-27","Q&A","if they become disconnected from the industry or the job where—that they used to work in,",""
"2021-01-27","Q&A","it can be years or never when they get back into the labor force,",""
"2021-01-27","Q&A","particularly for people who are well along in their careers—the same kind of scarring for small businesses,",""
"2021-01-27","Q&A","which don’t have the kind of resources that you need to get through this.",""
"2021-01-27","Q&A","So we’ve, we’ve had a big concern about, about both of those.",""
"2021-01-27","Q&A","We haven’t seen as much of it as we—as we feared.",""
"2021-01-27","Q&A","the jury is out here—9 or 10 million people still out of work because of the pandemic.",""
"2021-01-27","Q&A","They’re—a big chunk of them are people who worked in public-facing jobs in the service sector.",""
"2021-01-27","Q&A","they’ve gotten a lot of support from fiscal policy and some from monetary policy.",""
"2021-01-27","Q&A","But the question is getting them back to work.",""
"2021-01-27","Q&A","it’s harder if you’re—it takes longer,",""
"2021-01-27","Q&A","to find that next job if you’re looking at a brand-new industry.",""
"2021-01-27","Q&A","It’s not easy to change careers completely midcareer.",""
"2021-01-27","Q&A","stresses the to fly on airplanes,",""
"2021-01-27","Q&A","to go to sporting events and movie theaters,",""
"2021-01-27","Q&A","So those people are still at risk.",""
"2021-01-27","Q&A","very focused on that group of people with our policy and,",""
"2021-01-27","Q&A","the way we look at the economy.",""
"2021-01-27","Q&A","So many people have had that bridge across the pandemic.",""
"2021-01-27","Q&A","You know, we talked about that at the beginning.",""
"2021-01-27","Q&A","it’s clear that they’ve made it across,",""
"2021-01-27","Q&A","it’s been terribly inconvenient and painful,",""
"2021-01-27","Q&A","and schools are closed and things like that.",""
"2021-01-27","Q&A","But there, there’s a bunch of people yet who haven’t found that bridge yet.",""
"2021-01-27","Q&A","And we’re, we’re very focused on that.",""
"2021-01-27","Q&A","Of course, the other thing is, we’re going to a different economy.",""
"2021-01-27","Q&A","And we’re going to be learning more about that as we go.",""
"2021-01-27","Q&A","But, clearly, we’re, we’re learning that things can be done from remote locations.",""
"2021-01-27","Q&A","We’re learning that technology can replace people even more than we thought.",""
"2021-01-27","Q&A","And some of that is happening.",""
"2021-01-27","Q&A","the phase after—even after the economy fully reopens,",""
"2021-01-27","Q&A","I think we’re still going to need to keep people in mind whose lives have been disrupted,",""
"2021-01-27","Q&A","because they’ve lost that—the work that they did.",""
"2021-01-27","Q&A","And I think it would be wise as a country,",""
"2021-01-27","Q&A","for the longer-run productive capacity of the country,",""
"2021-01-27","Q&A","if we were to look out for those people and help them find their way back into the labor force even if it means continuing support for an additional period of time.",""
"2021-01-27","Q&A","I strongly agree with that, as a matter of fact.",""
"2021-01-27","Q&A","I think if you look at either—look at employment gaps or unemployment gaps or wage gaps,",""
"2021-01-27","Q&A","all of those persistent gaps that exist even controlling for many other factors,",""
"2021-01-27","Q&A","they’re—and they’re very difficult to explain.",""
"2021-01-27","Q&A","And so it’s—the reason we talk about inequality and,",""
"2021-01-27","Q&A","and racial inequality in particular,",""
"2021-01-27","Q&A","which is to achieve maximum employment,",""
"2021-01-27","Q&A","with—we want—we want the potential output of the United States to be as high as it can possibly be.",""
"2021-01-27","Q&A","We want—we want an economy where everybody can take part and everybody,",""
"2021-01-27","Q&A","everybody can put their labor in,",""
"2021-01-27","Q&A","and they can share in the prosperity of our great economy.",""
"2021-01-27","Q&A","if you go back to the—to the beginning,",""
"2021-01-27","Q&A","I mean, just, just take the financial markets, for example.",""
"2021-01-27","Q&A","all of those big buildings all over the,",""
"2021-01-27","Q&A","the—New York City and all around the world where people work in the financial markets with terminals and everything,",""
"2021-01-27","Q&A","and they had to take their terminals with them.",""
"2021-01-27","Q&A","And I think there was a real concern that there would be a tremendous loss of functionality just at the time when the financial markets were under floors or on virtual trading floors.",""
"2021-01-27","Q&A","Now, some of that’s reversing now.",""
"2021-01-27","Q&A","But we have definitely learned that we can do more work from home in many,",""
"2021-01-27","Q&A","that’s not possible if your job involves being at a place,",""
"2021-01-27","Q&A","For many people, it’s not possible.",""
"2021-01-27","Q&A","And that’s very much something that skews to higher-income,",""
"2021-01-27","Q&A","higher-educated people being able to work from home and others not so much.",""
"2021-01-27","Q&A","So I think we’ve learned that.",""
"2021-01-27","Q&A","when we saw the wave in the South and the West,",""
"2021-01-27","Q&A","the wave of cases this summer,",""
"2021-01-27","Q&A","having seen what happened in March and April,",""
"2021-01-27","Q&A","we expected there to be a significant hit to economic activity.",""
"2021-01-27","Q&A","And people kind of just got on with their lives and went and,",""
"2021-01-27","Q&A","and it didn’t actually—it had a much smaller effect on economic activity than we expected.",""
"2021-01-27","Q&A","which is just so much larger—a very,",""
"2021-01-27","Q&A","People going indoors, the cold weather, all of that.",""
"2021-01-27","Q&A","And even there, if you look at—I would say, look at the December jobs report.",""
"2021-01-27","Q&A","So, big job losses in, you know, in that part of the service sector.",""
"2021-01-27","Q&A","So I mentioned 400,000 jobs in bars and restaurants.",""
"2021-01-27","Q&A","There’s another 100,000 in similar kinds of activities.",""
"2021-01-27","Q&A","But if you go—if you look elsewhere, it’s not having an effect.",""
"2021-01-27","Q&A","even purchasing manager index and sentiment indexes on,",""
"2021-01-27","Q&A","on areas of the economy that are not directly—really directly—exposed to the pandemic in their economic activity,",""
"2021-01-27","Q&A","the way—the way—the way the housing industry worked,",""
"2021-01-27","Q&A","there was a lot of in-person contact.",""
"2021-01-27","Q&A","They managed that it’s, it’s now quite virtual rather than in person.",""
"2021-01-27","Q&A","So there’s been a lot of adapting,",""
"2021-01-27","Q&A","You just—you know, those are just going to—and that’s—again, that’s millions and millions of people.",""
"2021-01-27","Q&A","And so you’re just going to have to defeat the pandemic,",""
"2021-01-27","Q&A","And we need to—we need to finish the job.",""
"2021-01-27","Q&A","And we—it’s, it’s within our power to do that as a country this year.",""
"2021-01-27","Q&A","And I would just urge that—and I know people are working hard on that.",""
"2021-01-27","Q&A","that is really the main thing about the economy,",""
"2021-01-27","Q&A","is getting the pandemic under control,",""
"2021-01-27","Q&A","That’s the single most important economic growth policy that we can have.",""
"2021-03-17","Opening Statement","I would like to start by noting that it has been a full year since the pandemic arrived with force on our shores.",""
"2021-03-17","Opening Statement","it was clear that addressing a fast-moving global pandemic would be plainly and primarily the realm of health- care providers and experts,",""
"2021-03-17","Opening Statement","and we are grateful to them and to all the essential workers for their service and sacrifice.",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","we’ve said that we would continue asset purchases at this pace until we see substantial further progress.",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","And that’s actual progress, not forecast progress.",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","So—and that’s a difference from, from our past approach.",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","So—and what we mean by that is, is pretty straightforward.",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","that the labor markets have moved—labor market conditions have moved—you know,",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","have made substantial progress toward maximum employment,",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","and inflation has made substantial progress toward the 2 percent goal.",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","That’s what we’re going to want to see.",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","Now, that obviously includes an element of judgment.",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","And when we see—we’ll be—we’ll be carefully looking ahead.",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","in that suggests that we’re on track to perhaps achieve substantial further progress,",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","And we’ll say so well in advance of any decision to actually taper.",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","You know, we, we have a, a range of perspectives on the Committee.",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","and we always come together around a—around a,",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","the strong bulk of the Committee is,",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","is not showing a rate increase during this forecast period.",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","as the outlook improves very significantly since the December meeting,",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","you would expect forecasts to move up.",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","It’s probably not a surprise that some people would bring in their estimate of the appropriate time for liftoff.",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","the bulk of the Committee—the,",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","the largest part by far of the Committee is,",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","is—doesn’t show a rate increase during this period.",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","part of that is wanting to see actual data rather than just a forecast at this point.",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","We do expect that we’ll begin to make faster progress on both spending—you know,",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","labor markets and inflation as the year goes on because of the progress with the vaccines,",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","because of the fiscal support that we’re getting.",""

"2021-03-17","Q&A","Victoria, we’ll have something to announce on that in coming days.",""

"2021-03-17","Q&A","our estimates of maximum employment—and,",""

"2021-03-17","Q&A","It is the guidance that we chose carefully to implement our new framework.",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","And to meet these standards, we’ll need to see data, as I mentioned.",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","So what does—what does this, this SEP really say?",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","It says that we’re committed to our framework and to the guidance we’ve provided to implement that framework.",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","We will wait until the requirements set forth in that guidance are clearly met before considering a change in our policy rate.",""

"2021-03-17","Q&A","The state of the economy in two or three years is highly uncertain,",""

"2021-03-17","Q&A","maybe more quickly than it has in the past,",""

"2021-03-17","Q&A","This could be a different sort of a process.",""

"2021-03-17","Q&A","What I’m telling you is that the stance of monetary policy we have today,",""

"2021-03-17","Q&A","in a number of different dimensions should we deem that that’s appropriate.",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","But, for now, we think that our policy stance on that is appropriate.",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","You’ve spoken about the pandemic’s disproportionate toll on Black Americans,",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","and other groups in the labor market.",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","And I’m curious if you can speak to specific indicators that the Fed will be using to measure job gains for groups that have persistently higher rates of unemployment compared to white Americans.",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","since you’ve described vaccines as key to the economic recovery,",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","is the Fed concerned about lower vaccination rates in communities of color?",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","And what barriers do you think exist there?",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","we do monitor and communicate very regularly about different labor market—disparities in the labor market,",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","So the African American unemployment rate is substantially elevated,",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","and so is the Hispanic unemployment rate.",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","So we look at those and we see those as,",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","it’s slack in the labor market.",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","because those disparities had really come down to record lows since we started keeping the data that way.",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","is they move up at twice the speed of white unemployment.",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","but we’re going to look at those as,",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","as a form of slack in the labor market and hope that,",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","on a part of the economy that employs many minorities and lower-paid workers.",""

"2021-03-17","Q&A","they’re not tremendously well paid,",""

"2021-03-17","Q&A","They’re really not something we, we have within our policy toolkit to address.",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","that the data we have suggests that there are—there are significant disparities between different ethnic groups and—you know,",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","That’s for fiscal authorities and the government more generally to, to work on.",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","So I do think that fiscal policy overall will have really helped us to avoid much of the scarring that we were very,",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","very concerned about at the beginning.",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","And I think that’s just the size and the speed with which Congress has delivered—you know,",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","with the CARES Act and since then,",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","has—is going to wind up very much accelerating the return to full employment.",""

"2021-03-17","Q&A","As I mentioned in my remarks—opening remarks, the recovery has been faster than we expected.",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","given we’ve never seen an event like this.",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","But part of it is just the strength of the fiscal response,",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","will look good over the cases there.",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","and we will keep at it with our policies,",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","to do whatever we can to make sure that’s—that continues.",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","what it takes to drive productive capacity per capita or per hour worked,",""

"2021-03-17","Q&A","to support a more productive economy and raise living standards.",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","And that’s—you know, that hasn’t been the principal focus with these measures—our measures, certainly.",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","And we don’t have those tools.",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","But what Congress has been doing has mainly been replacing lost income and beginning to,",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","support people as the economy returns to normal.",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","But there should be a focus on—a longer-term focus,",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","You’re right that the pace of the recovery is that we’re having diverging recoveries here, as we did after the last crisis.",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","And in this case, as well as the other one, the",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","So we haven’t made a decision on that.",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","We’re a couple weeks away from announcing that decision.",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","I, I won’t foreshadow it here today.",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","I will say, we’re going to continue our data-driven approach.",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","You know that we restricted buybacks and dividends, so the firms are preserving capital.",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","Through 2020, the banks actually increased their level of capital quite stringent.",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","We’re right in the middle of our 2021 stress tests,",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","and we’ll release those results before the end of June.",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","very significant additional stress on top of the stress the banks have already absorbed over the past year,",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","with the unemployment rate going to 11 percent and stock prices falling more than 50 percent.",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","the results of the stress tests and the decision on distributions—all of that is to come fairly soon,",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","Well, you know, it all depends.",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","We’ve set out very clear criteria for liftoff,",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","where we’ve said we want to see labor market conditions that are consistent with our estimates of,",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","And that doesn’t just mean unemployment, it means a much broader set of criteria.",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","We want inflation at 2 percent, and not on a transitory basis.",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","And we want inflation on track to be moderately—to run moderately above 2 percent for some time.",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","Those are the three conditions.",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","Everybody on the Committee agrees to that, right?",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","So it comes down to, what’s your projection for the economy?",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","If you want to—if you want to—you know,",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","of assessments for how good the economy is that uncertainty about the forecast is,",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","is very high compared to the normal level.",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","We haven’t come out of a pandemic before.",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","We haven’t had this kind of fiscal support before, totaling it all up.",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","So you’re going to have different perspectives from Committee participants about how fast growth will be,",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","how fast the labor market will heal,",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","And those things are going to dictate where people write down an estimate of liftoff.",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","Of course, this isn’t a decision to lift off now.",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","We’ll make that decision then.",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","But it’s an estimate based on—based on assumptions about growth.",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","it’s meant to be a tool to generally show the public how,",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","how our objective function works,",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","how we think about the future.",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","It isn’t meant to actually pin down a time when we might or might not lift off.",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","We—you know, we’re not going to make that decision for some time.",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","The chances are that the economy in that time and place will be very different from the one we think it’ll be.",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","I have to be sure to point out that they—they’re not a Committee forecast.",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","And you know this, but it’s—they’re not a Committee forecast.",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","It’s just compiling these projections, really, of individual people.",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","We think it serves a useful purpose.",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","to actually be a promise or even a prediction of when the Committee will act.",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","That will be very much dependent on economic outcomes, which are highly uncertain.",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","it’s not up to us to decide what,",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","what Congress should spend money on or when.",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","I was answering Jeanna’s question,",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","how do we assure lack of damage to—scarring,",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","or lack of damage to the productive capacity of the economy?",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","And I think what’s happened so far has done a pretty good job of that.",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","I wanted to make the longer-run point that if—to work on the productivity—on productivity over longer periods,",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","that is—that is—comes down to a number of things.",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","But one of those things is investment:",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","I’m not in any way suggesting that that’s something Congress should work on right now.",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","Or that, you know, that’s just not my—that’s not our job.",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","that is what fiscal policy can do that,",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","is invest in the future productive capacity of the economy,",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","Those things are completely tools that Congress has.",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","And, again, I wasn’t making a comment at all on the current fiscal setting.",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","So, as you know, financial stability for us is, is a framework.",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","It’s not a particular market or a particular asset or anything like that.",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","debt owed by businesses and households,",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","and leverage among financial institutions.",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","And I’ll just quickly touch on them.",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","So if you look at asset valuations,",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","you can say that by some measures,",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","some asset valuations are elevated compared to history.",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","In terms of households and businesses,",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","the crisis in very good shape by historical standards.",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","Leverage in the household sector had been just kind of gradually moving down and down and down since the—since the financial crisis.",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","there was—there was some negative effects on that,",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","people lost their jobs and that sort of thing,",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","but they’ve also gotten a lot of support now.",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","So the damage hasn’t been as, as bad as we thought.",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","Businesses, by the same token, had a high debt load coming in.",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","And—but—and many saw their revenues decline.",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","But there’s—they’ve done so much financing,",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","and there’s a lot of cash on their balance sheet.",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","So nothing in those two sectors really jumps out as really troubling.",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","Short term—I mentioned funding risk as the—as the last one.",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","breakdowns in parts of the short-term funding markets—came under a tremendous amount of stress.",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","And they’ve been quiet since the spring.",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","And, you know, we shut down our facilities and all of that.",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","we don’t—we don’t feel like we can let the moment pass without just saying again that we—that those—some aspects of the short-term funding markets and,",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","nonbank financial intermediation didn’t hold up so well under great stress—under tremendous stress.",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","And we need to go back and look at that.",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","So a very high priority for us as regulators and supervisors is going to be to go back—and this,",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","this will involve all the other regulatory agencies;",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","it does involve all of them as well—and see if we can strengthen those",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","I wouldn’t read too much into,",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","Remember what it is: It’s a compilation of individual projections by individual members.",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","They’re all making different assessments.",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","They, they have different forecasts, economic forecasts.",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","Some have more optimistic ones, some less optimistic.",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","And they’re—also remember that the SEP doesn’t actually include all the things that go into maximum employment.",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","It’s, it’s only—it only includes unemployment.",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","So I, I would just say, we’ve set out clear guidance.",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","The—the message from the SEP that I would like to leave with people is,",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","it’s labor market conditions consistent with our estimates of maximum employment—and that’s not just unemployment,",""

"2021-03-17","Q&A","totaling up to maximum employment;",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","and inflation on track to exceed 2 percent for—moderately for some time.",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","We’re committed to robustly implementing that guidance.",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","three years is highly uncertain.",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","And I wouldn’t want to focus too much on the exact timing of a potential rate increase that far into the future.",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","we’re committed to giving the economy the support that it needs to return as quickly as possible to a state of maximum employment and price stability.",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","to the extent having rates low and support for monetary policy broadly,",""

"2021-03-17","Q&A","You’re asking about the relationship between unemployment and inflation?",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","Yes, I think I’m hearing you correctly.",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","So I would say a couple things.",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","There was a time when there was a tight connection between unemployment and inflation.",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","We had extremely low unemployment in, in—not extremely low.",""

"2021-03-17","Q&A","what happens is that when wages move up because unemployment is low,",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","companies have been absorbing that increase into their margins rather than raising prices.",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","And that seems to be a feature of late-cycle behavior.",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","when we—when we seek to achieve low unemployment,",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","we think we have the freedom to do that based on the data without worrying too much about inflation.",""

"2021-03-17","Q&A","was—the test was a substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market.",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","Well, it means a substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market.",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","It meant we would communicate when we thought we had that.",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","This is just like that, in a way.",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","What we’re saying is, substantial further progress toward our goals.",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","We’ll tell people when we think—until we—until we say—until we give a signal,",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","you can assume we’re not there yet.",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","well in advance—well in advance—we will give a signal that,",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","So that’s, that’s how we’re planning to handle it.",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","It’s not different, really, from, from QE3.",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","And I think we’ve learned—what we’ve learned from the experience of these last dozen years is to communicate very carefully,",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","it’s an outcome-based set of guidance,",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","and it’s going to depend on the progress of the economy.",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","That’s why it’s not appropriate to start pointing at dates yet.",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","we and everyone who’s forecasting these—what,",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","we are looking at the—at the amount of savings.",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","We’re looking at—you be the tendency of people to spend that money,",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","the marginal propensity to consume.",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","you can develop an estimate of the impact on spending,",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","So that’s, that’s what we’re all doing.",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","we have—we can look at history,",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","and those are all very transparent and public.",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","And you can compare one to the other.",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","And, of course, we’ve all—we’ve all done that.",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","And I think we’ve made very conservative assumptions and sensible mainstream assumptions at each step of that process.",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","what it comes down to is what I said before,",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","there very likely will be a step-up in inflation as March and April of last year drop out of the 12-month window,",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","because they were very low inflation numbers.",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","That’s a—that’ll be a fairly significant pop in inflation.",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","It’ll wear off quickly, though, because it—just the way the numbers are calculated.",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","people will start spending more,",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","you can only go out to dinner once per night,",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","but a lot of people can go out to dinner.",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","And so— and they’re not doing that now.",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","They’re not going to restaurants, not going to theaters.",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","That part of the economy—and travel and hotels—that part of the economy is,",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","But as that happens, people can start to spend.",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","It’s also—wouldn’t be surprising if—and you’re seeing this now,",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","particularly in the goods economy—there’ll be bottlenecks.",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","They won’t be—they won’t be able to service all of the demand maybe,",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","So those things could lead to—and we’ve, we’ve modeled that.",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","We’ve—and what we see is relatively modest increases in inflation.",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","So—but those are not permanent things.",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","airlines are, will be flying again, all of those things will happen.",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","And so it’ll turn out to be a one—a one-time sort of bulge in,",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","but it won’t change inflation going forward,",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","because inflation expectations are strongly anchored around 2 percent.",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","We know that inflation dynamics do evolve over time.",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","And there was a time when, when inflation went up, it would stay up.",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","And, and that time is not now.",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","That hasn’t been the case for some decades.",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","And we think it won’t—it won’t—we won’t suddenly change to another regime.",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","These things tend to change over time.",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","And they tend to—tend to change when the central bank doesn’t understand that having inflation expectations anchored at 2 percent is the key to it all.",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","the—having them anchored at 2 percent is what gives us the ability to push hard when the economy’s really weak.",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","If we saw inflation expectations moving materially above 2 percent,",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","we would conduct policy in a way that would,",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","would make sure that that didn’t happen.",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","We’re committed to having inflation expectations anchored at 2 percent,",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","not materially above or below 2 percent.",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","So that’s—I think if you—if you look at the savings,",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","that’s kind of what comes out of our assessment.",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","it’s a relatively unusual—very unusual situation to have all these savings and this,",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","this amount of fiscal support and monetary policy support.",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","Nonetheless, that, that is our most likely case.",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","as the—as the data come in and the economy performs,",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","Our outcome-based guidance will immediately adapt,",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","to meet whatever the actual path of the economy is.",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","I think it’s impossible to say,",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","I would expect it’s very possible—let’s put it that way—that you will see bottlenecks emerge and then clear over time.",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","And you’ll probably see that over a period of time,",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","the strong data are ahead of us.",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","You know, you’re, you’re—right now the, the checks are going out just, just now.",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","And that’ll, that’ll add to spending.",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","Vaccination is moving, now, quickly.",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","You know, the, the really strong economic data is coming.",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","It should be coming, assuming we stay on this track.",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","And that’s when you’ll really know where, where the bottlenecks are.",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","But you can see, though, that they’re not—these are not permanent.",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","It’s not like the supply side will be unable to adapt to these things.",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","It will—the market will clear.",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","And, and some of the answer to that may be price.",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","In many cases, it won’t be price.",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","You’ll see that people are reluctant to raise prices.",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","it’s a little bit the story about,",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","the wage—the wage Phillips curve does show that as unemployment goes down,",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","But companies choose not to try to,",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","that price increase along to their customers.",""
"2021-03-17","Q&A","So you’ll see a lot of that here too, I think.",""

"2021-04-28","Q&A","And it will take some time before we see substantial further progress.",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","so we have to leave questions about herd immunity and what that looks like to the health experts,",""

"2021-04-28","Q&A","we’ve said that we would continue at the current pace of asset purchases until we see substantial further progress toward our goals.",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","So—and that is, that is what it is, substantial further progress.",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","we want to see labor market conditions consistent with maximum employment,",""

"2021-04-28","Q&A","I won’t say that it’s impossible, but it, it seems—it seems unlikely.",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","It’s much more likely that we would—having achieved maximum-employment conditions—we’d also be seeing 2 percent inflation and be on track to see inflation moving above 2 percent.",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","So that’s not to say inflation won’t—might not move up,",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","but for inflation to move up in a persistent way that,",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","that really starts to move inflation expectations up,",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","that would have to—that would take some time.",""

"2021-04-28","Q&A","there is a—there’s a paragraph in the—in the Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy which says that when the two goals are somewhat in conflict,",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","the time it would take to get back and [so] forth.",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","So we do—it doesn’t really tell you what to do,",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","but it tells you that we will weigh those two factors and how far we are away from them and how long it would take to reach them were we to reach that sort of pretty unlikely state.",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","and I wonder if you can help us understand better your thinking about how COVID infection rates and the virus calibrate with monetary policy.",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","As you recall, we had a major resurgence in the virus last fall.",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","would you need to be assured that there wasn’t such a resurgence coming before you began—I mean,",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","for lack of a better term—thinking about thinking about tapering?",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","And what kind of comfort level would you need?",""

"2021-04-28","Q&A","downgrading the virus from a pandemic—before you have the comfort level to reverse course on policy?",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","we really have—just articulated the goals that I’ve—that I’ve just mentioned a couple of times,",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","which is substantial further progress toward our goals before we taper.",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","that’s very likely—for us to achieve that,",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","it’s very likely going to be the case that we’ve also made really significant progress on controlling the virus through vaccination and,",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","those two things should more or less coexist.",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","We haven’t articulated a separate test for a state of the virus that we’d like to achieve because we’re not—you know,",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","we’re not experts in that area.",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","we’re really focused on the economic outcomes,",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","my guess is that we—it’s very likely,",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","that for us to achieve the economic outcomes,",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","we would need to taper or to raise interest rates.",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","We would also have to have made very substantial progress in getting the virus under control—not,",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","not necessarily fully under control.",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","will have ongoing outbreaks over the summer and various regional outbreaks and potentially next winter",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","So I would say that we were very worried about scarring,",""

"2021-04-28","Q&A","The evidence is clear that it becomes much more difficult if you’re out for a long time to get back in and get back to the life that you had.",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","Same thing with these small businesses, many of which are the work of generations.",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","Were we going to wipe out many of those unnecessarily?",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","here we are in late April of 2021.",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","We haven’t experienced that level of scarring either in the labor market or among smaller businesses.",""

"2021-04-28","Q&A","Notwithstanding that, we’re a long way from full employment.",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","We’re—you know, payroll jobs are 8.4 million below where they were in February of 2020.",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","And also, it’s going to be a different economy.",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","industries that have been employing a lot of people.",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","it may well be—it seems quite likely that a number of the people who,",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","who had those service-sector jobs will struggle to find the same job and may need time to find work and get back to the working life they had.",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","These were people who were working in February of 2020.",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","So those people are going to need—they’re going to need help.",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","while I would say we haven’t seen really highly elevated levels of unemployment for—you know,",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","up in the teens that we thought we might have for an extended period of time,",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","we’ve still got a lot of people who are out to—out of work.",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","We want to get them back to work as quickly as possible,",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","and that’s really one of the things we’re trying to achieve with our policy.",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","So we do monitor the housing market very carefully, of course.",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","it’s a very different housing market than it was before the Global Financial Crisis.",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","And one of the main differences was that households were in very good no-doc lending practices were not there.",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","So we don’t have that kind of thing where we have a housing bubble where people are overlevered and owning a lot of houses.",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","that housing prices are going up,",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","and so we’re watching that carefully.",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","and there’s just not a lot of supply right now.",""

"2021-04-28","Q&A","because it just is going to be that much harder for people to get that first house,",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","we—it’s part of a strong economy,",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","with people having money to spend and wanting to invest in housing.",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","It’s clearly the strongest housing market that we’ve seen since the Global Financial Crisis.",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","housing builders can react to this demand and,",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","and come up with more supply and workers will come back to work in that industry.",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","it is—it’s not an unalloyed good to have prices going up this much,",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","and we’re watching it very carefully.",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","I don’t see the kind of financial stability current concerns,",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","that really do reside around the housing sector.",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","So many of the financial crackups in all countries,",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","that have happened in the last 30 years have been around housing.",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","We don’t—we really don’t see that here.",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","We don’t see bad loans and unsustainable prices and that kind of thing.",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","you were breaking up a little there,",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","but I think I did get your question.",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","So I think there are a number of—a number of things going on there:",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","the tension between a high level of unemployment and yet many,",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","many companies saying they can’t find— an elevated number of companies saying that they can’t find workers.",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","So, what’s really going on there?",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","It, it should be a number of different things.",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","There are workers who don’t actually have the specific skills that the employers are looking for.",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","There may be geographical differences.",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","there—one big factor would be,",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","so there are still people who are at home taking care of their children and would like to be back in the workforce but can’t be yet.",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","There are people afraid of—there are virus fears that are weighing on people,",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","so some—some people don’t want to go back to work.",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","There are also a significant number of people who say they’ve retired—a large number of people that say that they’re retired.",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","it’s hard to say whether they will come back in as the labor market strengthens and as COVID,",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","becomes a—in the rearview mirror,",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","So—but clearly there’s something going,",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","as many companies are reporting labor shortages.",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","We don’t see wages moving up yet,",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","and presumably we would see expansion,",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","but what we saw was that labor supply generally showed up.",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","if you were worried about there—about running out of workers,",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","You know, labor force participation held up.",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","People came in the labor force.",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","They stayed in the labor force longer than expected.",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","So my guess would be that you will see people coming back into the labor force,",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","and these jobs will be—the labor market will reach equilibrium.",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","But I do think that—and I do think also that unemployment insurance benefits will run out in September,",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","so to the extent that’s a factor,",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","it will no longer be a factor fairly soon.",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","it will come back to this economy where we have,",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","equilibrium between labor supply and labor demand.",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","It may take some months, though.",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","So I actually have a couple things I’d like to say about inflation,",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","So let me start with just saying that we’re very strongly committed to achieving our objectives of maximum employment and price stability.",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","our price stability goal is 2 percent inflation over the longer run,",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","and we believe that having inflation average 2 percent over time will help anchor long-term inflation expectations at 2 percent.",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","With inflation having run persistently below 2 percent for some time,",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","the Committee seeks inflation moderately above inflation for two times—above 2 percent for some time.",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","we’re making our way through an unprecedented series of events,",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","in which a synchronized global shutdown is now giving way to widespread reopening of economies in many places around the world.",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","fiscal and monetary policy continue to provide strong support:",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","and the economy is beginning to move ahead with real momentum.",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","During this time of reopening,",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","we are likely to see some upward pressure on prices,",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","But those pressures are likely to be temporary as they are associated with the reopening process.",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","In an episode of one-time price increases as the economy reopens is not the same thing as,",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","persistently higher year-over-year inflation into the future— inflation at levels that are not consistent with our goal of 2 percent inflation over time.",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","Indeed, it is the Fed’s job to make sure that that does not happen.",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","inflation were to move persistently and materially above 2 percent in a manner that threatened to move longer-term inflation expectations materially above 2 percent,",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","we would use our tools to bring ’70s,",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","And we know that our job is to achieve 2 percent inflation over time.",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","We’re committed to that, and we will use our tools to do that.",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","So that’s a very different situation than you had back in the 1960s—or many,",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","So let me talk quickly about the two reasons—two,",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","but really two main reasons why we think inflation will move up in the near term.",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","The first is the base effects.",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","Twelve-month measures of inflation are likely to move well above 2 percent over the next few months as the very low inflation readings recorded in March and April of last year drop out of the calculation.",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","That process has already started to show up.",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","You saw it in the March CPI reading,",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","and you’ll see it later this week in the PCE price data.",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","These base effects will contribute about 1 percentage point to headline inflation and about 0.7 percentage point to core inflation in April and May.",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","So, significant increases, and they’ll disappear over the following months.",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","They carry no implication for the rate of inflation in later periods.",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","The other big one I would talk about is bottlenecks.",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","So this is what we’re seeing in supply chains in various industries,",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","we’re in close touch with all of these industries.",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","the Fed has a network of contacts that is unequaled in businesses and in nonprofits for that matter,",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","So what do we mean by a bottleneck?",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","A bottleneck really is a temporary blockage or restriction in the supply chain for,",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","for a particular good or goods,",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","something that slows down the process of producing goods and delivering them to the market.",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","We think of bottlenecks as things that,",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","will be resolved as workers and businesses adapt,",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","and we think of them as not calling for a change in monetary policy since they’re temporary and bottlenecks,",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","the temporary effects that they will have on prices in the meantime.",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","So, you know, I’ll just sum up and say, we understand our job.",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","we are focused—as you’ve seen,",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","we’ve been focused on inflation deviating below 2 percent,",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","and we used our tools aggressively to keep it back up at 2 percent.",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","if we see inflation moving materially above 2 percent in a persistent way that risks inflation expectations drifting up,",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","then we will use our tools to guide inflation and expectations back down to 2 percent.",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","No one should doubt that we will do that.",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","we would be prepared to use our tools.",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","what we have right now is one really good—I can tell you what it’s not.",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","It’s not one really good employment reading, which is what we got in March.",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","We got close to a million jobs in March and a very strong labor market reading.",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","And I was just suggesting that we’d want to see So we have—we’re a long way from our,",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","And we don’t have to get all the way to our goals to taper asset purchases,",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","we just need to make substantial further progress.",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","On, on “largely,” there are a bunch of factors.",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","I was really thinking—we were thinking of the base effects and also the energy effects.",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","I wasn’t meaning to say there are some real effects.",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","I mean, there are always—there are always relative prices going up and down within inflation.",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","You know, there’s a basket for CPI or",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","we supervise banks to make sure that they have risk- management systems in place so that they can spot these things.",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","We don’t manage their companies for them or, or try to manage individual risks.",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","In the grand scheme of these large What was troubling,",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","was that this could happen in a business for a number of firms that is thought to be—to carry relatively well understood risks.",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","The prime brokerage business is,",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","is a well understood business,",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","and so it was surprising that a number of them would have had this.",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","that they had the same big risk position on with a number of firms,",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","and they weren’t—some of the firms were not aware that there were other firms that had those things.",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","I wouldn’t say it’s in any way an indictment of our supervision of these firms.",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","it may be they were—it seems as though there were risk-management breakdowns at some of the firms,",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","And that’s what we’re looking into.",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","I have not had a chance to do it yet,",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","I don’t want to visit it at a time of a lot of media attention,",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","because I don’t want that to be part of the story.",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","But I will—I will go visit when, when it’s no longer a, a news story.",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","I—I’ve met with homeless people many times,",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","I think it’s always good to talk to people and hear what’s going on in their lives.",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","What you find out is, they’re you.",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","they’ve just found themselves in this place.",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","it’s a—it’s a difficult problem,",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","I mean, I, I think I know what I’ll find there.",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","you connect with these people and what you—again,",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","I mean, that could be your sister.",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","That could be, you know, your kid.",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","you always feel that way in that sort of an encounter,",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","it just is a—it’s a—it’s an important thing to engage in,",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","we bring that understanding into our lives and,",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","into our work—the work that we do as well.",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","So I think the first thing to say is that we feel an obligation to understand the technology and all of the policy issues very,",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","Central bank digital currencies are now possible,",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","and we’re going to see some of them around the world.",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","And we need to understand whether that’s something that would be a good thing for the people that we serve.",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","How would it work in our system?",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","very difficult questions to answer,",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","but I think we—and we are engaged in a serious program to understand both the technology and the policy issues.",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","which are the best in the world;",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","all the things that make the United States the United States.",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","That’s why we’re the, the reserve currency.",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","we have open capital accounts,",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","which is essential if you’re going to be the reserve currency.",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","So those are the factors that make us the reserve currency.",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","I am—I’m less concerned that someone—that another country might have a digital currency first.",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","if you were a company that’s doing international business,",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","would you then suddenly start to use that currency to use your—do your international transactions,",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","or would you still do them in dollars,",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","where— which is what everyone does?",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","And I’m not so concerned about, about that.",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","I am really concerned about getting it right.",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","It is—it is a—it is a tricky set of questions that we have to navigate in a world where we already have,",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","a highly evolved payment system.",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","We have FedNow and other immediately available funds.",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","Pretty soon everybody will be able to,",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","to do what people do in other parts of the world,",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","which is just use their phone to make immediately available payments all the time.",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","And what would be the role of a central bank digital currency in that kind of an environment?",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","Far more important to get it right than it is to do it fast or feel that we need to rush to reach conclusions because other countries are moving ahead.",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","that—what the China—the currency that’s being used in China is not one that would—that would work here.",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","it’s one that really allows the government to see every payment that’s used—for which it is used in real time.",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","It’s much more to do with things that are",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","Inflation expectations before the pandemic hit—and here we think of survey,",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","market based—survey being either households or,",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","and I would say that they were at the low end of what would have been consistent with a 2 percent inflation target,",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","particularly our 2 percent inflation target,",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","which calls for 2 percent average inflation.",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","Inflation expectations actually went down a bit at the beginning of the pandemic,",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","and now they’ve just moved back up to levels broadly—that,",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","that are where they were in 2018,",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","more consistent with our mandate.",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","And we want them to be—we want them to be higher and—you know,",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","We want inflation to run a little bit higher than it has been running for the last quarter of a century.",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","We want it to average 2 percent, not 1.7 percent.",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","we need to see inflation expectations that are consistent with that,",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","really well anchored at 2 percent.",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","Breakevens very carefully, as you would obviously know.",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","So that’s where—that’s where I would say it is.",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","You know, we’re, we’re—inflation measures are always going to be a bit volatile.",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","and headline PCE to move up because of base effects,",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","I—and we expect that to go away.",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","We, we also expect these, these bottleneck effects to come in.",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","We don’t know how persistent they’ll be.",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","of when they will pass through,",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","not whether they will pass through.",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","But we can’t be confident about the exact timing of that or the size of them.",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","They don’t seem especially large at the moment, but, you know, we, we don’t know.",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","I mean, you know, this is—this is all about the reopening of the economy.",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","with a lot of help from fiscal policy,",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","some additional help from monetary policy,",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","a great deal of help from vaccination,",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","we’re seeing a strong rebound in activity.",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","it’s—demand can be spurred with fiscal transfers and—the saved-up fiscal transfers and,",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","and people going back to work and things like that.",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","The supply side will take a little bit of time to adapt.",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","New restaurants will have to be opened.",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","The supply of various inputs into the goods part of the economy will have to be brought back up to speed.",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","And you—you’re seeing some of that.",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","So we look at—financial stability for us is really—we have a broad framework,",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","so we don’t just jump from one thing to another.",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","I know many people just look at asset prices,",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","and they look at some of the things that are going on in the—in the equity markets,",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","which I think do reflect froth in the equity markets.",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","we try to stick to a framework for financial stability so we can—so we can talk about it the same way each time and so we can be held accountable for it.",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","So one of the areas is asset prices,",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","and I would say some of the asset prices are high.",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","seeing things in the capital markets that,",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","that are—that are a bit frothy.",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","I won’t say it has nothing to do with monetary policy,",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","but it also—it has a tremendous amount to do with vaccination and reopening of the economy.",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","That’s really what has been moving markets a lot in the last few months is this turn away from what was a pretty dark winter to now a fast—a much faster vaccination process and a faster reopening.",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","So that’s, that’s part of what’s going on.",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","Leverage in the financial system is,",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","we have very well capitalized large banks.",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","We have funding risks for, for our largest financial institutions that are also very low.",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","We do have some funding risk issues around money market funds,",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","but I would say they’re not systemic right now.",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","And, and the household sector is actually in pretty good shape.",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","It was in—it was in a very good shape as a relative matter before the financial crisis—sorry,",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","with high levels of unemployment and loss of wages and all of that,",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","that the—that the household sector would,",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","So, with the fiscal transfers, money that’s on household balance sheets, they’re in good shape.",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","You see relatively low defaults and that kind of thing.",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","So the overall financial stability picture is mixed,",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","I think it’s appropriate and important for financial conditions to remain accommodative to support economic activity.",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","8½ million people who had jobs in February don’t have them now,",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","there’s a long way to go until we reach our goal.",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","So the federal funds rate has been well within target and—at target range, and money market funds—money market conditions are, are fine.",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","We have the ability to use our administrative tools to make sure that that remains the case.",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","We do expect to, to support rates.",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","And, of course, we will do so if, if the need does arise.",""
"2021-04-28","Q&A","So I think capital requirements for banks are,",""

"2021-06-16","Q&A","you’ll see that the incoming data are,",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","are consistent with the view that prices—that prices that are driving that higher inflation are from categories that are being directly affected by the recovery from the pandemic and the reopening of the economy.",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","So, for example, the experience with, with lumber prices is, is illustrative of this.",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","The thought is that prices like that that have moved up really quickly because of the shortages and bottlenecks and the like,",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","And we did see that in the case of lumber.",""

"2021-06-16","Q&A","and that in fact it would reverse over time.",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","So we think we’ll be seeing some of that.",""

"2021-06-16","Q&A","as I pointed out at the last press conference,",""

"2021-06-16","Q&A","both for the maximum- employment goal,",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","we expect and I expect that we’ll see increases in supply over coming months as the factors that we believe have been suppressing supply abate,",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","I can’t give you an exact number or an exact time,",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","but I would say that we do expect inflation to move down.",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","If you look at the—if you look at the forecast for 2021 and—sorry,",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","2022 and 2023 among my colleagues on the,",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","on the Federal Open Market Committee,",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","you will see that people do expect inflation to move down meaningfully toward our goal.",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","And I think the full range of,",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","of inflation projections for 2023 falls between 2 and 2.3 percent,",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","which is consistent with our—with our goals.",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","I expect that we’ll be able to say more about timing as we see more data.",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","Basically, there’s not a lot of more light I can—I can shed on that.",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","But you can think of this meeting that we had as the “talking about talking about” meeting,",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","And I now suggest that we retire that term,",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","which has—which has served its purpose well,",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","Participants expect continued progress ahead toward that objective.",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","And assuming that is the case,",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","it will be appropriate to consider announcing a plan for reducing our asset purchases at a future meeting.",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","the Committee will continue to assess the economy’s progress toward our goals,",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","and we’ll give advance notice before announcing any decision.",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","will depend on the pace of that progress and not on any calendar.",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","we do tend to look at the longer-term inflation expectations,",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","the shorter-term ones do tend to move around based on,",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","So you’ll see if gasoline prices were to spike,",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","you’ll see the shorter-term inflation expectation measures,",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","that’s maybe not a good signal for future inflation if,",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","if gas happens to spike and then go back down again.",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","sort of further exacerbating concerns that we might find ourselves where,",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","the ECB and the Bank of Japan have been,",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","where you have expectations and inflation itself sliding down and you have a really hard time stopping that process once it begins.",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","to see inflation—longer-term inflation expectations move back up to a range—it’s a range that’s consistent with what our objectives are.",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","These are not precise measures, and that’s—and they, they contain risk premiums of various kinds.",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","And that’s why we look at a broad range of them and tend to look at the movement of that broad range of,",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","It’s, it’s, it’s a wide index, as I’m sure you know.",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","We look at that, and we see them back in the range where they were.",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","they’ve been broadly higher than that,",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","somewhat modestly higher than that,",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","was still anchored at around 2 percent or maybe even a little bit below.",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","I think they are anchored and they’re at a good place right now.",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","It’s gratifying to see them having moved up off of their pandemic lows.",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","it’s fundamental in our framework,",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","to assure that inflation—longer-term inflation expectations are anchored at a place that is consistent with our goal.",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","We, we think that’s an important reason.",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","if inflation expectations are not anchored at a place that’s consistent with your goal,",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","it’s not clear why you would expect to hit your goal over the longer term.",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","the judgment of when we have arrived at substantial further progress is one that the Committee will make.",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","And it would not be appropriate for me to lay out particular numbers that do or do not—that do or do not qualify.",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","That is—that is, you know, the process that we’re beginning now at the next meeting.",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","to assess that progress and talk about what we—what we think we’re seeing and,",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","and just do all of the things that you do to sort of clarify your thinking around the process of deciding whether and how to adjust the pace and composition of asset purchases.",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","the two hikes—so let me say a couple things first of all,",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","These are, of course, individual projections.",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","They’re not a Committee forecast, they’re not a plan.",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","And we did not actually have a discussion of whether liftoff is appropriate at any particular year,",""

"2021-06-16","Q&A","it gives some sense of how participants see the economy evolving in their most likely case.",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","the main message I would take away from the SEP is that participants—many,",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","many participants are more comfortable that the economic conditions in the Committee’s forward guidance will be met somewhat sooner than previously anticipated.",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","And that would be a welcome development.",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","it means the economy will have made faster progress toward our goals.",""

"2021-06-16","Q&A","The focus of the Committee is the current state of the economy.",""

"2021-06-16","Q&A","Liftoff is, is well into the future.",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","The conditions for liftoff—we’re very far from maximum employment, for example.",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","It’s, it’s a consideration for the future.",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","So the near-term thing is really—the real near-term discussion,",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","discussion that will begin is really about the,",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","we had a discussion about that today and expect to,",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","continue to think about our progress.",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","So our intention for this process is that it will be orderly, methodical, and transparent.",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","we see real value in communicating well in advance what our thinking is.",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","And, as I mentioned, we’ll, we’ll give advance notice before announcing a decision to taper.",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","And so all I can say is that we,",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","we think it’s important—we think where the balance sheet’s concerned,",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","as much transparency as we can give,",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","and as far—as far in advance as we can to give people a chance to adjust their expectations.",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","we expect to be in that business until we reach substantial further progress and then have a—have a decision.",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","Again, I have nothing further on time.",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","It wouldn’t be appropriate to say.",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","We’re going to have to see more data.",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","We’re a ways away from substantial further progress, we think.",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","Again, as we—as we approach that goal, we’ll provide, you know, as much clarity as we can.",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","so as part of our year-and-a-half-long process,",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","the review that we did and came out with at the end of that with the—with the new Statement on Longer- Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy,",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","we looked carefully at the idea.",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","We’ve all read all the literature around different formulas for makeup and things like that.",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","I strongly agree—that it’s not wise to,",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","to wed yourself to a particular formulation of that.",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","So we did adopt a discretionary—there’s an element of discretion in it.",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","it says that we will seek to—seek inflation that runs moderately above 2 percent for some time.",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","it’s meant to create a broad sense that we want inflation to average 2 percent over time.",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","And that under the old—under the old formula,",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","2 percent was a ceiling because all of the errors were below.",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","You were always getting back to 2 percent.",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","So you were bouncing back and forth between 1½ and 2,",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","and we wanted them to be centered around 2.",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","So, so that’s, that’s the approach that we’re taking.",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","And you’re right, it’s not—it’s not a formulaic approach.",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","We were clear on that when we announced the framework.",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","Was there another part of your question, Craig?",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","So on the—on the facility, we think it’s doing its job.",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","We think it’s doing—the reverse repo facility is,",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","is doing what it’s supposed to do,",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","which is to provide a floor under money market rates and keep the federal funds rate well within its—well within its range.",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","So we’re not concerned with it.",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","It’s doing—you have an unusual situation where the Treasury General Account is,",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","is shrinking and bill supply is shrinking.",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","there’s downward pressure—we’re buying assets—there’s downward pressure on short-term rates,",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","is doing what we think it’s supposed to do.",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","Sorry, your second question was again?",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","I think we’ll have to see empirically.",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","But it’s designed to keep the federal funds rate, you know, within the range.",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","And I do think it could have some effect on, on broader money market conditions below as it relates to, you know, the very low rates and the downward pressures.",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","And, you know, the funny thing, you would think that it would, but we’ll have to see.",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","It’s, it’s possible that that would not be the case.",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","That’s going to be an empirical question.",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","there isn’t one indicator we can look to,",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","and there’s no one number that we can therefore point to.",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","We look at a range of indicators,",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","you can count to a high number just quickly—but,",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","it will include things like unemployment and participation and wages and many different flavors of that.",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","We’re all going to be informed by what we saw in the last cycle,",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","which was labor supply outperforming expectations over a long period of time.",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","Now, that hadn’t happened in many other cycles, but this was a very long cycle.",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","So we’re going to have to be alert to see whether that can happen again.",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","It is a different—it’s a different economy.",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","We, we have had a slew of retirements, and that may weigh on participation.",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","should wear off in a few years and,",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","as you move through that window,",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","because they would have—people would have retired anyway,",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","So I think we’re—I think that lesson number one is,",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","is just to be careful about assessing maximum employment.",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","And I think if you—during the last cycle,",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","there were—there were waves of concern that we were reaching full employment as early,",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","all going to be informed by that.",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","At the same time, we understand this is a different economy.",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","and that should have a secular effect of,",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","of reducing participation over time.",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","So we have to be sensible about what, what can be done.",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","But I think we’re going to be—we’re going to lean into that and be optimistic.",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","You know, we’re seeing wage increases.",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","That’s, that’s sort of a natural thing to be seeing in a strong economy.",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","And what we’re seeing is—we don’t see anything that’s troubling in the sense of—what would be troubling would be,",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","wages at unsustainable levels without high inflation.",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","wages in excess of productivity and inflation,",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","by a meaningful amount broadly across the economy,",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","sort of forcing companies to keep raising prices and getting into a wage–price cycle.",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","That’s, that’s the old formula for—one of the old formulas for having high inflation.",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","We don’t see anything like that now.",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","for people who are mostly new,",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","many of them in low-skilled jobs.",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","we do think—you’ve got to—you’ve got to think in the labor market right now,",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","where supply and demand are just not matched up well.",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","And, you know, we think it’s a flexible economy and, and it will clear.",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","There will—there will be a level at which supply and demand meet.",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","And that’ll—we think that’ll, that’ll be happening in coming months.",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","So—but the last thing I’ll say is,",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","we are going to be in a very strong labor market pretty quickly here.",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","There are still a big group of unemployed people.",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","And, you know, we’re not going to forget about them.",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","We’re going—we’re going to do everything we can to get people back into work and give them the chance to work.",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","But there’s bit how we’re looking at the—at the labor market.",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","What I can say is, we’re working on it.",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","I don’t have anything to share with you in terms of the particulars or the timing right now,",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","we’ve always—our position has been for a long time and,",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","we’d like the leverage ratio to be a backstop to risk-based capital requirements.",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","it does skew incentives for firms to substitute lower-risk assets for high-risk ones.",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","And because of the substantial increase in reserves,",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","and other safe assets in the banking system,",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","the SLR is rapidly ceasing to become— ceasing to be the intended backstop for big firms that we want it to be.",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","So we do think it’s appropriate to consider ways to adapt it to this new high-reserves environment,",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","and we’re looking hard at the issue.",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","we will take whatever actions are necessary to assure that any changes we do make or recommend do not erode the overall strength of bank capital requirements.",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","Sorry, I can’t give you any more.",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","That’s just something we’re working on.",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","price jumps we’ve seen in some raw materials—lumber,",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","you mentioned that earlier—seem to be easing.",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","And it looks like we’re at the beginning of suppliers catching up with demand.",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","But I wonder if you’re worried at all,",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","if we’re going to end up with excess supply immediately after those shortages wear off and if we just continue this mismatch,",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","as we’re recovering and getting out of the pandemic economy.",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","And I wonder how that would affect the Fed’s outlook at all.",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","Well, that is really not the problem we’re having right now.",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","people who work in commodity industries are very focused on that,",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","build capacity and then find out that it’s not necessary.",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","So, really, the problem now is, is that demand is very, very strong.",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","Incomes are high, people have money in their bank accounts.",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","Demand for goods is extremely high, and it hasn’t— it hasn’t come down.",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","We’re seeing the service sector reopening.",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","And so you’re seeing prices are moving back up off their lows there.",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","there is a possibility on the other side of this that,",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","that inflation could be—could actually be quite low going forward.",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","But that’s not—that’s not really where our focus is right now.",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","our expectation is that these,",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","these high inflation readings that we’re seeing now will start to abate.",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","And that’s, that’s what we think.",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","And it’ll be like the lumber experience,",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","and like we expect the used car experience to be.",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","With things like airplane tickets and hotels,",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","which are the other two factors in the most recent CPI report that went up a lot,",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","we expect that those prices will get back up to where they were,",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","but there’s no reason to think that they’re going to keep going up happen.",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","I think in terms of the timing and the effects on inflation in the near term,",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","The overall story is one that,",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","and we think the incoming data support it and,",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","And if you look at the forecasts on the FOMC,",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","you will—you will see that as well.",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","But we don’t—we don’t in any way dismiss the chance that it can work out that,",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","that this goes on longer than expected.",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","And the risk would be that over time, it does begin to affect inflation expectations.",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","And if we see inflation expectations and inflation—or inflation moving up in a way that is really materially above what we—what we would see as consistent with our goals,",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","we wouldn’t hesitate to use our tools to address that.",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","Price stability is half of our mandate, and we would certainly do that.",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","We do not expect that, though.",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","and in that we’re joined by many other forecasters,",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","but there’s a lot to be humble about among forecasters.",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","Forecasters have a lot to be humble about.",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","It’s a—it’s a highly uncertain business.",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","And we’re, we’re very much attuned to the risks and, and watching the data carefully.",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","we should—as I mentioned earlier,",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","there’s so much uncertainty around this.",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","it’s just a unique situation that we need to see how things evolve in coming months and,",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","and see how that story holds up and act accordingly.",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","You know, it’s a—it’s a continuum, right?",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","What you’ve seen with the pandemic is sharply declining cases, hospitalizations, and deaths.",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","And, and, you know, that should continue.",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","you also saw in the United Kingdom,",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","at least as high if not higher vaccination rates,",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","they’ve had an outbreak of the Delta variety.",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","And it’s—and it’s causing them to have to—to have to react to that.",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","So you’re not—you’re not out of the woods at this point.",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","And it would be premature to—in my thinking, it would be premature to declare victory.",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","Vaccination still has a ways to go to get to levels—it would be good to see it get to a substantially higher level.",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","And, you know, that can only help.",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","So, look, I—but you’re right, the statement language is evolving.",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","I would expect it to continue to evolve.",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","There’s a lot of judgment in that.",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","But you can expect us to drag our feet a little bit on that,",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","because that’s what you do with statement language.",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","It’s, it’s great to see the progress.",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","But, again, I would not declare victory yet.",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","I would say it is so great to see the reopening of the economy,",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","and to see people out living their lives again.",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","You know, who doesn’t want to see that?",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","and I just would encourage people to continue to get vaccinated.",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","since March what’s happened is,",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","people have grown more confident in these very strong outcomes,",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","that they’ll be strong labor demand.",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","We’ve also seen—we have seen inflation above target,",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","they do see inflation coming back down over ’22 and ’23 into,",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","into areas that are very consistent with our—with our mandate.",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","is something that can factor into people’s thinking about appropriate monetary policy.",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","these are 18 different forecasts,",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","and I can’t stand here and say exactly what was in all 18 people’s minds.",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","that is something that I think can factor into things as well—factor into our forecast as well.",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","So what we’re seeing in the near term—again,",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","our base case is that what we’re seeing in the near term is,",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","with the reopening of the sides of the economy adapt.",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","We have a very highly adaptive, you know, flexible economy, more so than most.",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","those increases are really about,",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","or high employment is a way to think about it.",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","That’s about the kind of broad inflationary pressure that results from,",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","a really strong expansion tightening up resource utilization across the whole economy and lifting,",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","And that’s why—that’s why you would see it then,",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","in the forecast—and it’s just a forecast,",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","In people’s forecasts, that’s what’s happening.",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","I think—there may be an element of the latter as well,",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","because inflation expectations have continued to move up.",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","You know, it’s all in people’s individual thinking, and you can’t—it’s hard to say.",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","It’s not something the Committee debates in terms of,",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","So I’m, I’m a little bit speculating, which I shouldn’t do.",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","But it wouldn’t surprise me if there’s an element for some people in,",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","seeing the inflation performance that we’ve had and thinking that I have more confidence that we could see inflation above 2 percent,",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","that it may not be as hard to do that as we thought,",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","and that inflation expectations may move up to a—to a level—they were—they were really at a level that was kind of a little below 2 percent.",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","They might move up as a consequence of this or,",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","You know, we did see inflation expectations moving",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","We’re looking at an economy that will not have the degree of, of fiscal support.",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","The fiscal support in the forecast is much less than it was this year.",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","you’ve still got a very strong growth,",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","well above the longer-run potential output of the— of the economy.",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","You’ve got—you’ve got growth meaningfully above that,",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","and inflation is lower next year in all of our—in all of our forecasts.",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","of core PCE forecast for next year is 1.7 to 2.5 in 2022 and,",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","3½ percent growth for next year.",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","that’s a really good year—coming on the back of a 7 percent growth year,",""

"2021-06-16","Q&A","A higher neutral rate would mean that interest rates would run higher by that amount.",""
"2021-06-16","Q&A","and that would be a good thing from the standpoint of the economy,",""

"2021-07-28","Q&A","Any central bank has to deal with that by looking at the inflation and asking whether it is broad based and likely to be persistent and,",""

"2021-07-28","Q&A","It’s a—it’s a really unusual situation to have—to have the ratio of vacancies to unemployed be this high.",""

"2021-07-28","Q&A","There, there’s research that suggests that there is a speed limit on that.",""

"2021-07-28","Q&A","There are many parts of the country where it might not have an effect,",""

"2021-07-28","Q&A","That’s not what “transitory” means.",""

"2021-07-28","Q&A","then you have a price increase,",""
"2021-07-28","Q&A","but you don’t have an inflation process.",""
"2021-07-28","Q&A","And so part of that just is that,",""
"2021-07-28","Q&A","if it doesn’t affect longer-term inflation expectations,",""
"2021-07-28","Q&A","then it’s very likely not to infect—to affect the process of inflation going forward.",""

"2021-07-28","Q&A","does that mean they’re going to go up the next year by the same amount?",""
"2021-07-28","Q&A","So you’re going to be in a process where inflation, the inflation process, gets going.",""
"2021-07-28","Q&A","And, and that happens because people’s expectations about future inflation move up.",""
"2021-07-28","Q&A","And we don’t we have two mandates: maximum employment and price stability.",""
"2021-07-28","Q&A","Price stability, for us, means inflation averaging 2 percent over time.",""
"2021-07-28","Q&A","And so we’ve got to be very careful about that.",""
"2021-07-28","Q&A","I think it’s a good point that it’s,",""
"2021-07-28","Q&A","it’s a term—what it really means is temporary.",""
"2021-07-28","Q&A","But then you’ve got to understand that it doesn’t mean that the—that the increases will be taken back.",""
"2021-07-28","Q&A","Some of them will be, but, but that’s not really what it means.",""
"2021-07-28","Q&A","and we’ll be coming back down the road in a couple of months,",""

"2021-07-28","Q&A","it’s there to help address pressures in money market—money markets that could impede the effective implementation of monetary policy.",""
"2021-07-28","Q&A","it’s to support the function of—functioning of monetary policy and its,",""
"2021-07-28","Q&A","And it’s set up with that purpose in mind.",""
"2021-07-28","Q&A","so we think it’s doing what it’s supposed to do,",""
"2021-07-28","Q&A","which is to help provide a floor for money market rates and help ensure that the federal funds,",""
"2021-07-28","Q&A","funds rate stays within the target range.",""
"2021-07-28","Q&A","what’s happening is that it just results in a lower aggregate amount of Federal Reserve liabilities that are in banks in the form of reserves and a higher amount of Federal Reserve liabilities in money market funds in the form of overnight RRP balances.",""
"2021-07-28","Q&A","So that, that’s all that’s really happening there.",""
"2021-07-28","Q&A","And we expect it to be high for some time.",""
"2021-07-28","Q&A","by the relatively lower quantity of Treasury bills and,",""

"2021-07-28","Q&A","we’re targeting a moderate overshoot of 2 percent inflation for some time.",""

"2021-07-28","Q&A","are—we’re actually responsible for this,",""

"2021-09-22","Opening Statement","We at the Fed will do everything we can to support the economy for as long as it takes to complete the recovery.",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","So the test for beginning our taper is that we’ve achieved substantial further progress toward our goals of [2 percent] inflation and maximum employment.",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","And for inflation, we appear to have achieved more than significant progress—substantial further progress.",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","So that part of the test is achieved,",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","in my view and in the view of many others.",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","So the question is really on the maximum-employment test.",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","So if you look at a good number of indicators,",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","in many cases more than half of the distance,",""

"2021-09-22","Q&A","So that could be substantial further progress.",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","I guess my own view would be that the test—the “substantial further progress” test for employment is all but met.",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","once we’ve met those two tests,",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","once the Committee decides that they’ve met [them]—and that could come as soon as the next meeting;",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","that’s the purpose of that language,",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","is to put notice out that that could come as soon as the next meeting.",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","The Committee will consider that test,",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","and we’ll also look at the broader environment at that time and make a decision whether to taper.",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","the inflation forecasts have moved up a bit in the outyears.",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","And that’s really, I think, a reflection of—and they’ve moved up significantly for this year.",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","a reflection of the fact that the bottlenecks and shortages that are being—that we’re seeing in the economy have really not begun to abate in a meaningful way yet.",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","So those seem to be going to be with us at least for a few more months and perhaps into next year.",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","So that suggests that inflation’s going to be higher this year,",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","and a number—I guess the inflation rates for next year and 2023 were also marked up,",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","but just by a couple of tenths.",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","Why—those are very modest overshoots.",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","You’re looking at 2.2 and 2.1,",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","we want to foster a strong labor market,",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","and we want to foster inflation averaging 2 percent over time,",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","and I think we’re very much on track to achieve those things.",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","In terms of the framework, I see this as very consistent with the framework.",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","We want inflation expectations to be anchored at around 2 percent.",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","we’re—that’s really the ultimate test of whether we’re getting this done under the framework.",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","And, you know, we do want inflation to run moderately above 2 percent.",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","I wouldn’t put too much on a couple of tenths over 2 percent in 2023 and ’24—one-tenth in ’24.",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","But you’re right, those are the numbers.",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","So let me say that there’s very broad support on the Committee for this plan,",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","both as to the timing and as to the pace of the taper.",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","So this was a unanimous vote today,",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","and I’d say quite broad support for this approach.",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","You’re correct that there are some who would prefer to have gone sooner,",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","and they’ve made their arguments publicly.",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","For some of them, it’s a financial stability concern.",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","And for others, it’s other concerns.",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","They can make their own arguments.",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","This is an approach that the Committee will broadly support,",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","and it will put us having completed our taper sometime around the middle of next year,",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","Then, as the recovery got going, they supported aggregate demand, as they will do.",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","And now we’re in a situation where they still have a use,",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","but it’s time for us to begin to taper them.",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","Their usefulness is much less as a tool than it was at the very beginning.",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","this leaves the whole question of rate increases ahead,",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","which is really where the framework—the framework is all about how we deal with rate increases and that sort of thing.",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","So we think this is the appropriate way to go.",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","And, again, broad support on the Committee.",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","substantial further progress toward our goals is the test for beginning the taper.",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","And the taper takes some months in everyone’s figuring.",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","So you’re going to be well away from satisfying the liftoff test when we begin the taper.",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","So in terms of the liftoff test,",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","it’s what we adopted last September.",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","It’s labor market conditions consistent with maximum employment.",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","And while we have interesting signs that,",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","the labor market’s very tight,",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","we also have lots of slack in the labor market,",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","and we think that those imbalances will sort themself out.",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","Inflation at 2 percent and on track to achieve it,",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","that test by the time we reach liftoff.",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","if you look at what people are writing down for year-end 2022 numbers,",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","some people are writing down very low unemployment rates.",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","And that’s only one indicator, but it suggests a very strong labor market.",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","And I think they’re writing down in good faith what they see as meeting the test.",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","There’s a range of perspectives about where the economy will be,",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","all but one participants have us lifting off during 2023.",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","So it’s not really an unusually wide array of views about this.",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","So, no, I was not aware of the specifics of what they were doing.",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","So let me just say a couple things about this subject.",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","We understand very well that the trust of the American people is essential for us to effectively carry out our mission.",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","And that’s why I directed the Fed to begin a comprehensive review of the ethics rules around permissible financial holdings and activity by Fed officials.",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","the same as those for government agencies,",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","plus a number of things that apply specifically to us because of our business.",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","there are times when we’re not allowed to trade at all or to,",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","buy and sell financial assets.",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","And that’s the period immediately before and during an FOMC meeting.",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","And, third, there’s regular disclosure.",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","ownership and activities are all disclosed on an annual basis.",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","I would have had to go back and read people’s financial disclosures to know what their activities have been.",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","This has been our framework for a long time,",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","and I guess you’d say it’s served us well.",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","The other thing you would say—that it is now clearly seen as not adequate to the task of really sustaining the public’s trust in us.",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","and we’re going to do that as a consequence of this.",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","This will be a thoroughgoing and comprehensive review.",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","We’re going to gather all the facts and look at ways to further tighten our rules and standards.",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","I think that’s a reasonable thing.",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","Yeah, and, of course, for the most part, we don’t.",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","I mean, it was a real coincidence; I happened to pre-own these munis.",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","They were bought many years ago, actually.",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","And so we started buying munis as part of the Municipal but as a general principle, yeah, that makes a lot of sense.",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","I’ll call it a unique situation where,",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","very widespread reports from employers all over the economy saying it’s quite difficult to hire people,",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","I think— widespread view a few months ago was that several things were coming together in the fall,",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","including kids back to school,",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","which would lighten caregiving duties,",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","including the expiration of unemployment—extra unemployment benefits,",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","and other things would come together to provide an increase in labor supply,",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","and so we’d get out of this strange world where there’re lots of unemployed people and a high unemployment rate but a labor shortage.",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","or when they’re always at a threat of being closed because of Delta,",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","Rather than going ahead and taking a job and starting work only to have to quit it three weeks later,",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","you’re going to wait until you’re confident of that.",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","So some of that may not have happened.",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","hiring and spending in these face-to-face service industries,",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","it just kind of stopped during those months.",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","was largely in travel and leisure,",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","and that’s because of—clearly because of Delta.",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","And so what we—we know things that didn’t happen.",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","I think there’s still—it may just be that it’s going to take more time.",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","people will—these are people who were largely working back in February of 2020.",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","They’ll get back to work when it’s time to do that.",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","It just may take a longer time.",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","though—it didn’t happen with any force in September,",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","In terms of the—you asked also about the test for November.",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","I think if the economy continues to progress broadly in line with expectations,",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","then I think—and also the overall situation is appropriate for this,",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","then I think we could easily move ahead at the next meeting.",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","Or not, depending on whether we feel like that, those tests are met.",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","So Dodd-Frank created this position,",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","there’s actually a specific assignment in the Dodd-Frank language,",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","what it means is that the Vice Chair for Supervision is charged with setting the regulatory agenda.",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","And, you know, it’s a specific grant of authority.",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","that person has really done that.",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","Dan Tarullo certainly did it, and Vice Chair Quarles did it as well.",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","And I would, I think—I respect that authority.",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","I respect that that’s the person who will set the regulatory agenda going forward,",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","In terms of Vice Chair Quarles’s term,",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","we’re not currently in that situation,",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","and I actually don’t have any updates for you on that today.",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","We’ll keep you posted on that.",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","so the point of the broad and inclusive goal was not to target a particular unemployment rate for any particular group.",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","we look at a broad range of—a very broad range of metrics when we think about what maximum employment is.",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","And one of the things we look at is unemployment rates and participation rates and wages for different demographic and age groups and that kind of thing.",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","So I think if you look back, what were we really thinking?",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","So we all saw the benefits of a strong labor market.",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","If you look at the last two or three years of,",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","you saw—after a lot of long progress,",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","you saw a really strong labor market.",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","And you saw wages at the low end moving up faster than everywhere else—something that’s great to see.",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","We also saw the lowest unemployment rates for minorities of various,",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","We saw a really, really healthy set of dynamics.",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","And, by the way, we also—there was no reason why it couldn’t continue.",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","So I was very much thinking that the country would really benefit from a few more years of this.",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","It would have been—so we’re all quite eager to get back to that.",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","We also said we wouldn’t raise rates just in response to very low unemployment,",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","So that was another aspect of it,",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","because we saw that that really benefited labor market participants in a broad and inclusive way.",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","That’s, of course, not the current situation.",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","We have significant slack in the economy and inflation well above target,",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","So that’s, really, how we think about it.",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","It isn’t really just targeting the headline numbers,",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","but it’s about taking all of those things into account in your thinking about what constitutes maximum employment.",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","Well, you really—I mean, first of all, ideally, there wouldn’t be any gap, of course.",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","We would all love to see no such gap.",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","This is a persistent gap, and it’s very hard to explain based on typical metrics.",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","famously broad and blunt tools.",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","I think eliminating inequality and racial discrimination and racial disparities and that kind of thing is really something that fiscal policy and other policies—frankly,",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","education policies and that kind of thing—are better at focusing on.",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","I think we’ve identified the part that we can do, and we’ll do that part.",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","But I’ve always been clear that it’s going to take policies broadly across society to work on these problems.",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","So, I missed the first few words, but I think I got your question.",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","So it’s just very important that the debt ceiling be raised in a timely fashion so that the United States can pay its bills when and as they come due.",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","That’s a critically important thing.",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","The failure to do that is something that could result in severe reactions,",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","severe damage to the economy and to the financial markets.",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","And it’s just not something that we could contemplate, that we should contemplate.",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","I’m not going to comment on particular tactics or things like that.",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","I’m just going to say that I think we can all agree that the United States shouldn’t default on any of its obligations—should pay them when and as due.",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","no one should assume that the Fed or anyone else can protect the markets or the economy in the event of a failure—fully protect in the event of a failure to,",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","to make sure that we do pay those debts when they’re due.",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","You know, I don’t generally ever talk about the conversations I have with elected officials or other appointed officials.",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","But, look, you can see that this is a major focus among those who have responsibility for it, and—including elected people.",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","urging the Fed to break up Wells Fargo, citing what she called “ungovernable behavior” from the bank.",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","I’m just curious, under what circumstances would the Fed actually consider revoking a financial holding company’s license?",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","And if the indiscretions at Wells Fargo, in your opinion, warrant such an action?",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","very closely monitoring Wells Fargo’s efforts to fix its widespread and pervasive problems.",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","They represent a serious matter to us, and the firm is required to remediate them.",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","And we will take appropriate supervisory action if the firm fails to meet our expectation.",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","We continue to hold the firm accountable for its deficiencies with an unprecedented asset cap that will stay in place until the firm has comprehensively fixed its problems.",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","And we’re not going to remove that asset cap until that’s done.",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","we’ll take strong supervisory action if a firm is engaging in unsafe and unsound practices or violating laws.",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","But I can’t speak to our confidential supervisory assessments of any individual bank.",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","So that’s, yeah, that’s a good question.",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","the five-year review that we do under this unusual provision of law where all of the Reserve Bank presidents are reviewed for reappointment at the same time every five years,",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","that is really a broad review about their leadership of the institution,",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","their performance on the FOMC,",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","And if there were a concern—a public concern or a private concern—about something that someone had done,",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","we wouldn’t wait for the five-year.",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","We wouldn’t wait that day if there were concerns.",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","you can trade financial instruments, but not specific ones like bank debt.",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","You can’t trade during the FOMC period and during the meeting—the blackout period and then during the meeting.",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","And then you disclose all this, and we have disclosed it for years.",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","So all of these things have been going—to the extent they’ve been going on,",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","they’ve been a matter of public record.",""

"2021-09-22","Q&A","So I think we’ll be able to get to sensible decisions fairly expeditiously when it’s time.",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","But it’s just not time yet, in my thinking.",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","So within—let’s just take the household surveys generally.",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","let me talk about that specifically,",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","and this is from the New York Fed.",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","It’s only an eight-year-old survey,",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","and it does seem as though the,",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","they’re looking three years out.",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","And it seems like there’s a high correlation between three-year and one-year.",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","surveys are showing that households expect higher inflation in the near term but not in the longer term.",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","And that’s also what expectations are showing.",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","So there are many, many different inflation measures, of course.",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","And that’s why we have this thing called the CIE,",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","it’s an index of—it’s market-based measures,",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","And you just put them all—it’s not,",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","it doesn’t have a lot of grand theory about it.",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","You put them all in, and you measure the change.",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","you measure things like the dispersion and that sort of thing,",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","And, you know, it tells a story of inflation expectations moving up.",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","Many of the different measures will also show inflation expectations moving back up to where they were in,",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","which was before the really—the drop in inflation expectations broadly happened in ’14 and ’15—around then.",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","So that’s not a troubling thing.",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","But, you know, inflation expectations are terribly important.",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","We spend a lot of time watching them.",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","And if we did see them moving up in a troubling way and running persistently above levels that are really consistent with our mandate,",""

"2021-09-22","Q&A","we can always—we haven’t decided to taper yet,",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","and we haven’t decided the pace yet.",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","So, you know, it’s not my expectation that we would have to.",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","We can certainly speed up or slow down the taper if we—if it becomes appropriate,",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","we always said we weren’t on a preset course.",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","I think this will be a shorter period.",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","The economy’s much farther along than it was when we tapered in 2013.",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","So it makes sense to allow the runoff to happen.",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","It will be when we agree on it.",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","but we certainly have the freedom to either speed it up or slow it down if that becomes appropriate.",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","You wouldn’t, no, because, you know, when you’re—as long as you’re buying assets, you’re adding accommodation, and it wouldn’t make any sense to, you know, then lift off.",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","I mean, what you would do is, you’d speed up the taper, I think, if that were the situation you’re in.",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","Not—we don’t expect to be in that situation, but I do think it would be wiser at that point to go ahead and speed up the taper, just because the two are then working in the same direction.",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","So we think it’s really important that the central bank maintain a stable currency and payment system for the public’s benefit.",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","We also live in a time of transformational innovation around digital payments,",""
"2021-09-22","Q&A","and we need to make sure that the Fed is able to continue to deliver to the public a stable and trustworthy currency and payment system.",""

"2021-09-22","Q&A","and today they really are not in some cases.",""

"2021-11-03","Q&A","By the way, we’re also not at maximum employment, as I mentioned.",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","So I would want to assure people that we will use our tools as appropriate to get inflation under control.",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","We don’t think it’s a good time to raise interest rates,",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","because we want to see the labor market heal further.",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","And we have very good reason to think that that will happen as the Delta variant declines,",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","So “transitory” is a word that people have had different understandings of.",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","it carries a sense of “short lived,” and that’s,",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","there’s a real time component—measured in months,",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","what “transitory” has meant is that if something is transitory,",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","it will not leave behind it permanently or very persistently higher inflation.",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","we took a step back from “transitory.” We said “expected to be transitory,” first of all,",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","to show uncertainty around that—we’ve always said that,",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","we just hadn’t done it in the statement—but also to acknowledge,",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","that it means different things to different people.",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","And then we added some language to really explain more what we’re talking about in paragraph two and paragraph three.",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","We said that “supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic and the reopening of the economy have contributed to sizable price increases,” and we said,",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","“Progress on vaccinations and an easing of supply constraints are expected to support continued gains in So it’s,",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","it’s become a word that’s attracted a lot of attention that maybe is distracting from our message,",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","which we want to be as clear as possible.",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","the only other thing I would say is,",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","we understand completely that it’s particularly people who are living paycheck to paycheck or seeing higher grocery costs,",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","higher gasoline costs—when the winter comes,",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","higher heating costs for their homes.",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","We understand completely what they’re going through.",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","we will use our tools over time to make sure that that doesn’t become a permanent feature of life.",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","Really, that’s one of our principal jobs, along with achieving maximum employment.",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","That’s a decision for the Committee.",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","I would put it to you this way.",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","When we reach maximum employment,",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","when we reach a state where labor market conditions are at maximum employment in the Committee’s judgment,",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","it’s very possible that the inflation test will already be met.",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","We’re aware that that language sounds,",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","it sounds a little out of touch with what’s going on,",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","we’re not at maximum employment.",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","we’ll look to see whether the inflation test is met,",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","and there’s a good chance that it will be if you look at how inflation has evolved in the last year and a half.",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","how should we wonder what “moderately” over and “for some time” mean?",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","What I’m really saying is, that question is not before us right now.",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","You know, we had the question on when to taper.",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","We’ve now answered that question and the speed of it and all that.",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","We have not focused on whether we meet the liftoff test,",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","because we don’t meet the liftoff test now because we’re not at maximum employment.",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","given where inflation is and where it’s projected to be,",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","let’s say we do meet the maximum-employment test.",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","Then the Committee—the question for the Committee at that time will be,",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","has the inflation test been met?",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","I don’t want to get ahead of the Committee on that,",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","but the answer may very well be “Yes,",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","it’s been met.” But we’re not asking that question today,",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","because we’re not running a liftoff test.",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","We’re not evaluating the liftoff test today.",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","We didn’t have that discussion at today’s meeting.",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","We did talk about the economy and the development of the economy,",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","but we didn’t ask ourselves whether the liftoff test is met,",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","it’s clearly not met on the maximum-employment side.",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","So that’s not a decision for bank regulators or for any agency.",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","That’s a decision for elected representatives.",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","So we feel that any role that we have—and we do think we have a role in climate change.",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","It relates to our existing mandates,",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","and our existing mandates are,",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","prudential regulation of financial institutions.",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","and the public will expect us to expect them,",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","to understand and be in a position to manage their risks.",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","So that’s physical risk, and it’s transition risk for climate.",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","the large financial institutions are doing this already,",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","we think that’s right within our mandate.",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","There’s also a financial stability question, the overall stability of the financial system.",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","And so, from that standpoint, we can do research.",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","We can try to help understand what will the pathways be through which climate change effects the economy—both physical risk and transition risk.",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","That’s what we can do, and that’s what we will do.",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","Within the frame of our existing mandates, we’ll do it well.",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","We’re not the people who will decide the national strategy on climate change.",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","That has to be elected people, and not so much us.",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","We feel like we have that narrow mandate, and we will do it well.",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","we—let me just say that this system,",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","the ethics system we had in place had been in place for decades and had,",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","and then that was no longer the case.",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","And so we had no moment of denial about that.",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","As a group, we stepped in, and we took the actions that we took.",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","we announced a new set of rules to,",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","to try to put us back where we need to be,",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","we need to have the complete trust of the American people that we’re working in their interest all the time—absolutely critical to our work,",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","as it is for any government agency.",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","And I feel like this called that into question.",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","So we reacted, I would characterize it, strongly and forcefully.",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","If there were other things that we could do that were reasonable,",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","So you asked me about blind trusts.",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","the overall authority for ethics around these issues in the federal government is the Office of Government Ethics,",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","let me say what’s happened—and we’re very,",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","very straightforward about it—is that inflation has come in higher than expected,",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","and bottlenecks have been more persistent and more prevalent.",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","We see that just like everybody else does,",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","and we see that they’re now on track to persist well into next year.",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","That was not expected—not expected by us, not expected by other macro forecasters.",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","it’s difficult enough to just forecast the economy in normal times.",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","global supply chains in turmoil,",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","And you’re talking about a pandemic that’s holding people out of the labor force for reasons that we can sample,",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","but we don’t have a lot of experience with this.",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","So it’s very, very difficult to forecast and not easy to set policy.",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","So we have to set policy, though.",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","to look at your question this way,",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","I don’t think that we’re behind the curve.",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","I actually believe that policy is well positioned to address the range of plausible today.",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","And the reason is that there’s still ground to cover to get to maximum employment.",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","And we don’t want to stop that when there’s good reason to think—there’s still good reason to think,",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","there’s good reason to think that the economy will reopen,",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","particularly if we do get past,",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","So in terms of the balance sheet,",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","those questions that you mention—we haven’t gone back to them.",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","I expect that that’s exactly know,",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","when we’re doing a new subject like that,",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","we’ll have a series of briefings and discussions.",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","And that’s what we will now begin to do.",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","In terms of the effect of asset purchases on the economy,",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","there’s a tremendous amount of research and scholarship on this.",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","you can kind of—you can find different people coming out with different views.",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","the most mainstream view would be that you’re at the effective lower bound,",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","so how do you affect longer-term rates?",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","One, so you can’t lower rates—let’s say you can’t lower rates any further, hypothetically.",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","So you can give forward guidance.",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","we’re going to keep the rates low for a period of time,",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","either [for] a specific period,",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","[or] until certain conditions are met.",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","and that’ll have an effect on longer-term borrowings even,",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","The other thing you can do is,",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","you just go buy those securities,",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","That will drive down longer-term rates and hold them lower,",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","right across the rate spectrum matter for borrowers.",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","So lower rates encourage more borrowing, encourage more economic activity.",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","People—you can service your debt.",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","You know, it’s not different from what we do at the short end.",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","So that was discussed long before anybody did it.",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","That was—I think Milton Friedman said that that was what you could do if you were pinned at the lower bound,",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","So, anyway, that’s how it’s supposed to work.",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","it’s quite hard to be precise about these things because,",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","and you can’t run two different economies right next to each other and do a scientific experiment.",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","But most people do what we do.",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","More accommodative financial conditions lead to more economic activity, over time, with a lag.",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","So I think that’s the main finding I would say on",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","So I’m not going to—I won’t have any—I will answer your question, Paul, but I’m not going to have any comment whatsoever on the renomination process at all.",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","that I have briefed Administration officials,",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","and I’ve briefed people on Capitol Hill in detail about what we did and why we did it,",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","this is—part of my job is—Congress has oversight over the Fed,",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","and we take that very seriously.",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","one of the two committees that has oversight over us,",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","then I’m in regular contact with you,",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","And, you know, when something like this comes up, I’m on the phone.",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","I’m offering to meet with you and explain it to you and answer your questions and identify any concerns people might have.",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","So I don’t have anything for you on supplemental leverage ratio right now.",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","if there are ways we can address liquidity issues through that channel.",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","We’re also—we also have a—there’s a working group headed by [the] Treasury about,",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","and what happened in the acute phase of the pandemic,",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","and what structural things may need to be done.",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","So that would be part of that workstream,",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","and I know that there’s a lot going on.",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","I’m not sure when that report will be out.",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","That’s one of the many issues that are part of that,",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","along with things like central clearing of Treasuries,",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","It’s important that we have a liquid Treasury [securities] market.",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","It’s a huge public benefit that we do,",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","I think we need to do those things that enable that,",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","while also assuring the safety and soundness of our largest financial institutions,",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","who tend to be the main dealers.",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","So we have to make sure that that’s always a first order of concern as well.",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","I’m not going to answer who I spoke to at all.",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","I just, I’m not going to give you any names, so don’t take that as a “yes” or “no.” I’m just not going to start down that road.",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","So, what’s happening is, people are leaving their jobs.",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","They’re quitting their jobs in all-time-high numbers—but,",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","going back into employment and getting higher wages.",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","So a lot of the higher wages you’re seeing are for job switchers rather than incumbents.",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","that’s a sign of a really strong labor market,",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","as opposed to people just running off and quitting.",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","There have also been—there are a significant number of retirements,",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","and we’ll just have to see what that means.",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","toward the end of the last cycle,",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","which was the longest in our recorded economic history,",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","we did see labor force participation moving up well above what economists estimate was the trend,",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","and part of that was people staying in the labor force or just not retiring at the rates they were expected to retire.",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","So maybe this was just catch-up on that.",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","you won’t know how far—you won’t know what can happen with labor force participation in advance.",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","You’re just going to have to give it some time,",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","because we saw that over and over again.",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","Labor force participation is a much more flexible subject for me,",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","and so I do think we need to be So in terms of full employment,",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","at the very beginning of the recovery,",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","the natural thing to do was to look back at labor conditions,",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","labor market conditions in February of 2010,",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","at the end of the longest expansion in our history.",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","There was so much to like about that labor market,",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","a really historically good labor market—never perfect,",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","We’re in a different world now.",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","This is a—it’s just very different.",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","The pandemic recession was the deepest, and the recovery has been the fastest.",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","And wages didn’t really go down.",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","And, you know, real incomes were more than fully replaced by fiscal policy [support].",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","All of this is completely unusual.",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","an economy where inflation was driven by services is now inflation where—all the inflation is in goods,",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","which have had negative inflation for a quarter-century.",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","So you ask about full employment.",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","I think we have to—I’m very open to the thought that it’s going to be an empirical question of where it is located,",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","and we’re just going to learn more and more.",""
"2021-11-03","Q&A","I hope we’ll learn in the next,",""

"2021-12-15","Q&A","longer than the traditional thought of,",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","when we communicate about what we’re going to do,",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","the markets move immediately [in response] to that.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","So financial conditions are changing to reflect,",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","the forecasts that we made and basically,",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","fairly in line with what markets were expecting.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","But financial conditions don’t wait to change until, until things actually happen.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","They, they change on the expectation of things happening.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","So I don’t think it’s a question of having to wait.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","So we, we haven’t made any decision of that nature.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","And so, no, I wouldn’t say that’s our position at all.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","We really haven’t taken a position on that.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","I will say that we did talk today–We had our first discussion about the balance sheet,",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","And we went through the way—the sequence of events regarding the runoff and that sort of thing with the balance sheet,",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","And I think people thought that was an interesting discussion.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","They thought that it was informative,",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","but people pointed out that this is a significantly different economic situation that we have at the current time,",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","and that those—the differences that we see now would tend to influence how we think about the balance sheet.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","And the same thing would be true about raising rates.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","I don’t—I don’t foresee that there would be that kind of very employment.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","Inflation is running well above target, and growth is well above potential.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","There wouldn’t be the need for that kind of long delay.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","we’ll make this decision in coming meetings,",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","and it’s not—it’s not a decision that the Committee has really focused on yet.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","we’re not going back to the same economy we had in February of 2020.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","And I think early on, that was—the sense was that that’s where we were headed.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","The post-pandemic labor market, and the economy in general, will be different.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","And the maximum level of employment that’s consistent with price stability evolves over time within a—within a business cycle and over a longer period,",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","in part reflecting [the] evolution of the factors that affect labor supply,",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","including those related to the pandemic.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","we’re at 4.2 percent now and it’s been—the unemployment rate has been dropping very quickly.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","So we’re already in the vicinity of 4 percent.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","as unemployment insurance ran off,",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","that we would see a significant surge,",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","So we’ve begun to see some improvement.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","We certainly welcome the 2/10 improvement that we got in the November report.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","But I do think that it’s—it feels likely now that the return to higher participation is going to take longer.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","that’s been the pattern in past cycles—that labor force participation has tended to recover in the wake of a strong recovery in unemployment,",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","which is what we’re getting right now.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","So you—it could well have been that this cycle was different because of the short nature of it and the very strong—the number of job openings,",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","you would have thought that that would have pulled people back in.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","But, really, it’s the pandemic, it’s a range of factors.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","we don’t have a strong labor force participation recovery yet,",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","and we may not have it for some time.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","At the same time, we have to make policy now.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","And inflation is well above target.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","So this is something we need to take into—take into account.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","So this is—this is not at all a decision that the Committee has made.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","But you’re really asking a question about how our framework works.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","there is a— there’s a provision,",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","it used to be called the “balanced approach” provision,",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","that in situations in which the pursuit of the maximum-employment goal and [the pursuit of] the which could,",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","be taken and it’s in our framework,",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","it’s been in our framework a long time.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","I’ve talked about it on a number of occasions.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","it is a provision that would enable us to,",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","move before achieving maximum employment.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","we’re making rapid progress toward maximum employment in my—in my thinking,",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","And I don’t at all know that we will—that we’ll have to invoke that,",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","that is part of our framework—and has been,",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","I think there’s a lot of uncertainty,",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","which is why we—why we called it out in our statement,",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","we follow the same experts and I—we,",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","we talk privately to the same experts that everyone else does and read the same articles in the paper and the same research and,",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","so the—you mentioned the early assessment is highly transmissible,",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","from States and replace Delta as the dominant variant fairly quickly.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","I think there’s another step there,",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","though—which is what’s going to be the effect on the economy.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","on how much it suppresses demand as opposed to suppressing supply.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","It is not clear how big the effects would be on either inflation or growth or hiring on top of what’s already going on,",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","wave of Delta that’s hitting large parts of the country across the northern United States and all the way to the eastern seaboard and now coming down.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","We’re having quite a wave of Delta.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","it’s very difficult to say what the economic effects would be.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","I do think, wave upon wave, people are learning to live with this.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","More and more people are getting vaccinated.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","So [vaccinated] people who get the new variant,",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","it affects them much less than it tends to affect,",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","people who are not vaccinated.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","So the more people get vaccinated, the less the economic effect.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","It doesn’t mean it won’t have an economic effect.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","Delta had an effect of slowing down hiring.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","And it actually—it had an effect on global supply chains.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","And that sort of—that hurt the process of the global supply chains getting worked out.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","So it can have an economic effect.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","I just think, at this point, we don’t know much.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","We’ll know a whole lot more in three weeks,",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","and we’ll know more than that in six weeks.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","So I guess I would go back and—you know, it’s been a continual process, really.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","Inflation really popped up, right?",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","And we had a view—it was very,",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","very widely held in the forecasting community—that this would be temporary.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","It was quite narrow, you know, a limited number of factors were causing it.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","And there was a decent amount of evidence to support that view,",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","that it would be temporary or transitory,",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","we had five months of declining month on month—monthly readings of inflation,",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","but we didn’t see much in the way of progress on labor supply or on other supply-side issues.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","we started to see—it started to become clear that this was both larger in its effect on inflation and more persistent.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","and one of the consequences of that is that we move the taper forward.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","We moved the taper forward and we—and it’s a much faster taper than had been planned.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","So we’ve been adapting—I’ve been saying we’re adapting our policy.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","reading for the employment compensation index for the third quarter,",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","And I thought for a second there whether we—whether we should increase our taper,",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","[We] decided to go ahead with what we had—what we had “socialized.” Then,",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","we got the next Friday after the meeting,",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","we got a very strong employment report and,",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","revisions to prior readings and,",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","and no increase in labor supply.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","really decided that I thought we needed to—we needed to look at,",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","So that’s, that’s really what happened.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","It was essentially higher inflation and faster—turns out much faster progress in the labor market.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","what’s happening is the unemployment rate is catching up—seems to be catching up—with a lot of the other readings of a tight labor market,",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","6/10 [decline] over one cycle.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","So that’s really what happened and,",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","widely supported in the Committee today,",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","as you can see—unanimous vote—but beyond that I think widely,",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","So—but I said—you, you quoted me correctly.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","we don’t see—wages are not a big part of the high-inflation story that we’re seeing.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","let’s assume that the goods economy does sort itself out,",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","and supply chains get particular—we don’t see this yet,",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","but if you had something where wages were persistently— [increases in] real wages were persistently above productivity growth,",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","It would take something that was persistent and material for that to happen.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","But with the kind of hot labor market readings— wages we’re seeing,",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","it’s something that we’re—that we’re watching.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","And the other thing, of course, is, is rents, which are very important.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","You know, owners’ equivalent rent.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","That’s another thing which is very economically sensitive.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","Unlike the things that are causing the inflation now,",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","this is economically sensitive—and so would be expected to move up.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","And so as the—as some things go down,",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","Where will we be when we come out the other side of this?",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","And we need to keep our eyes on those things.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","Well, as you know, you know, the SEP is not a plan.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","or really discuss in terms of what the right answer should be.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","their assumptions—their assessment of appropriate policy based on 4 percent and then unemployment will be 3½ percent by the end of the year.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","So that’s a really strong economy.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","if the—if the economy turns out to be quite different from that,",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","we can’t change our policy because we wrote something down in December.” No one’s ever said that or will.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","It will—the actual rate decisions we make will depend on our evolving assessment of the forecast.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","if the economy were to slow down significantly,",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","then you would expect that that would have an effect of slowing down rate increases.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","maximum employment and price stability,",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","and we make policy based on them,",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","and not with respect to what we wrote down in a prior",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","whether or not we— whether or not we say “we’re at conditions—labor market conditions consistent with,",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","with maximum employment” next year,",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","we would all be open and I think expect,",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","that the level of maximum employment that’s consistent with price stability would increase further over time—for example,",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","So I—we would certainly—we would not,",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","want to foreclose the idea that the labor market can get even better.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","with inflation as high as it is,",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","we have to make policy in real time.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","We’ve got to make that assessment in real time.",""

"2021-12-15","Q&A","Quits, the wages—all those things are, are even hotter.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","But what would it take for labor force participation to move up more?",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","You know, that’s—really, “Why is it low?” is the question.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","and all of them probably have some,",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","Part of it will be that people—for certain people,",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","they don’t want to go back in the labor force because either they’re medically vulnerable or they’re not comfortable going back while COVID is still everywhere.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","The lack of availability of childcare made for caretakers is certainly part of it—not just for children,",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","It has been pointed out by many that the stock market is high,",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","people’s portfolios are stronger—they may go back to being a one-income rather than a two-income family.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","The same thing with people’s houses.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","People buy—they have a mortgage,",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","and the house price increases,",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","the equity they have in their home might have doubled.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","And they might make—reach the same conclusion.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","So they’re—and people have savings on their balance sheet because of forced savings because they couldn’t spend on travel and things like that and also because of,",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","for all of those reasons—and it’s hard to know exactly the part each of them plays— we,",""

"2021-12-15","Q&A","people—and this is how they want to maximize their welfare and that’s,",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","it’s something that will abate very quickly if their new life and they lose contact with their old jobs.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","That’s, that’s what the evidence would say.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","It isn’t that the economy lacks stimulus.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","it’s that there aren’t enough jobs and people can’t find jobs and,",""

"2021-12-15","Q&A","The problem is a supply-side problem,",""

"2021-12-15","Q&A","That’s what everyone would really like to see:",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","What does the labor force— what does the labor market look like in a world without COVID?",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","That would be the thing that we’d really like to see but,",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","it doesn’t look like that’s coming anytime soon.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","Well, there’s a demographic trend underlying all of this.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","And we actually got above the demographic trend at the end of the last expansion.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","But—so one would expect over time that labor force participation would,",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","would move down because an aging population,",""

"2021-12-15","Q&A","that the trend would be lower and that,",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","The question of how much we can get back up closer to where we were in February of 2020—and,",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","for the year or so before that—is a good one.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","And, I mean, I—What we can getting paid well.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","In the labor market we had before,",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","you know—the biggest wage increases were going to people at the bottom end of the wage spectrum for the last couple of years.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","There were just a lot of really desirable aspects of a labor market like that.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","Higher participation is one of them.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","And we’d love to get back there.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","we have the tools that we have,",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","which are essentially to stimulate demand and also to control inflation.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","it might be—one of the two big threats to getting back to maximum employment is actually high inflation,",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","the evidence grows that it’s going to take some time.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","And what we need is another long expansion, like the ones we’ve been having.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","three of the four longest in our recorded history,",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","which was the longest in our recorded history.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","That’s what it would really take to get back to the kind of labor market we’d like to see.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","And to have that happen, we need to make sure that we maintain price stability.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","and the median forecasts for core and headline inflation did move up by 4/10 each.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","So that’s a significant—you know, in an SEP, that’s a pretty significant move up.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","You know, it’s, it’s based on both of those things, I suppose.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","I do think there’s a broad expectation among forecasters,",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","that the bottlenecks will alleviate sometime over the course of this year.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","If you look at where Blue Chip forecasts are—which is,",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","large forecasting operations with a I would say,",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","as well that our policy should begin to have an effect.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","but it should begin to have an effect on that as well.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","And, you know, that’s the most likely case.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","I guess what—the thing I would want to say,",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","is we can’t act as though that’s a certainty,",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","and we’re not going to act as though that’s a certainty.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","that inflation may be more persistent and that may be putting inflation expectations under pressure,",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","and that the risk of higher inflation becoming entrenched has increased.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","I don’t think it’s high at this moment, but I think it’s increased.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","And I think that’s part of the reason behind our move today.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","[It] is to put ourselves in a position to be able to deal with that risk.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","And I think we are in a position to deal with that risk.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","We need to see how the inflation data and the—all the data evolve in coming months,",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","to use our tools to make sure that higher inflation doesn’t get entrenched.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","it’s one of the two big threats,",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","the other being the pandemic itself,",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","to getting back to maximum employment.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","You know, I think the concerns there are not so much current financial-stability concerns.",""

"2021-12-15","Q&A","particularly if they were to be,",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","associated with one of the very large tech networks that exist and you could have a payment network that was immediately systemically important—close to immediately systemically important that didn’t have appropriate regulation and protections.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","The public relies on the government—and [on] the Fed,",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","in particular—to make sure that the payment system is safe and reliable,",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","as well as the dollar and—you know,",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","to provide a safe and reliable trusted currency.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","So—but I do think those are longer term.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","that are really speculative assets,",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","I don’t see them as a financial-stability concern at the moment.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","they’re not backed by anything,",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","and I think there’s big consumer—issues for consumers who may or may not understand what they’re getting.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","And there’s certainly developments in the—in the markets that are worth following,",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","which are really not in our jurisdiction,",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","the kind of leverage that’s built into and those sorts of things is certainly worth,",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","Going back to inflation, is the Fed “behind the curve” on getting inflation under control?",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","I actually think we are well positioned to deal with,",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","with the range of plausible outcomes that can come.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","And I think if you look at how we got here,",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","we’ve been adapting to the incoming data,",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","noticing and calling out that,",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","that the—both the effects and the persistence of inflation of bottlenecks and labor shortages and things like that.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","So we’ve been calling out the fact that those were becoming longer,",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","And now we’re in a position where we’re ending our taper within the next—well,",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","and we’ll be in a position to raise interest rates as and when we think it’s appropriate.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","And we will, if that—to the extent that’s appropriate.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","At the same time, we’re going to be seeing a few more months of data.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","I don’t actually think we’re out of position now.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","I think this was an important move for us to make.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","I think that the data that we got toward the end of the fall was a—was a really strong signal that inflation is more persistent and higher—and that the risk of it remaining higher for longer has grown.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","And I think we’re reacting to that now.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","And we’ll continue to adapt our policy.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","So I wouldn’t look at it that we’re “behind the curve.” I would look at it that we’re actually in position now to take the steps that we’ll need to take,",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","in a thoughtful manner to address all of the issues,",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","So our interest rate—I mean, they are separate tools.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","So the—you know, the, the asset purchases are a separate tool from interest rates.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","Stopping asset purchases does not remove accommodation.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","It just stops adding further accommodation.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","Whereas raising interest rates starts to remove accommodation from what is a highly accommodative stance.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","the extent to which they’ll be separated in time is,",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","is something we haven’t really discussed at the Committee [meetings] yet.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","We will be discussing that, obviously, in coming meetings.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","there was quite a long separation before interest rates.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","I don’t think that’s at all likely in this cycle.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","very different place with high inflation,",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","the SEP medians are for 4 percent growth next year,",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","3½ percent— 3½ percent unemployment at the end of the year,",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","headline inflation of 2.6 percent next year,",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","one in which it’s appropriate for,",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","So they’re separate, I would say.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","Your—sorry, your second question was?",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","we did have a balance sheet discussion,",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","first discussion of balance sheet issues today,",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","We’ll have another at the next meeting and another at the interesting and informative.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","And—but to one degree or another,",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","people noted that this is just a different situation,",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","and those differences should inform the decisions we make about the balance sheet this time.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","So [we] haven’t made any decisions at all about,",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","about when runoff would start,",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","but we’re—we’ll be continuing to—you know,",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","in relation to when either liftoff happens or the end of the taper.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","But those are exactly the decisions we’ll be turning to in coming meetings.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","No, I’m not expressing any judgment about, about the stimulus in, in that comment.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","there’s a—there’s a sense among some that “you wanted inflation,",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","how do you like it?,” you know?",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","this is not the inflation that we were—what we were talking about in the—in the framework was inflation that comes from a tight labor market,",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","So we had 3½ percent unemployment for a period,",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","and we had inflation that was just barely getting to 2 percent.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","we can afford to wait to raise rates until we see actual inflation rather than [acting] preemptive[ly] because,",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","no one had seen what 3½ percent unemployment would look like—with high labor force participation,",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","No one had seen what it would look—really look like for an extended period,",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","And we didn’t incorporated that into our framework.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","This is something completely different.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","that’s a situation where you had a very,",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","very high level of employment and low inflation.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","This is literally the opposite.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","where we have very high inflation and we’ve had it since the labor market was in terrible shape.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","this inflation has really nothing to do with tightness in the labor market.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","and strong demand was supported by the Fed,",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","I’m not making any judgments on Congress, it’s not my job.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","what we certainly hope will be a once in a lifetime,",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","certainly historic—the first really global modern pandemic—which looked at the beginning like it might cause a global depression.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","And, you know, so we threw a lot of support at it [the economy].",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","people will judge in 25 years whether we—whether we overdid it or not,",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","is the right one for the situation that we’re in.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","Sure, I’d be happy to talk about that.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","So, as I mentioned, we got the ECI reading just before the November meeting.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","We got the labor market report two days after the meeting.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","I think on the 12th of November,",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","It was really the CPI reading,",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","I just came to the view over that weekend that we needed to speed up the taper.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","And we started working on that.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","That's a full 10 days or so before the President made a decision of renominating me.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","So, honestly, it had—it had nothing to do with that at all.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","And I just thought this is what we got to do.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","My colleagues were out talking about the—a faster taper.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","And that doesn’t happen by accident.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","They were out talking about a faster taper before the President made his decision.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","So it’s a decision that effectively was in—more than in train and,",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","to the point where people were talking about it publicly.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","And it had absolutely nothing to do with it whatsoever.",""
"2021-12-15","Q&A","We’re always going to just do what we think is the right thing,",""

"2022-01-26","Opening Statement","We at the Federal Reserve will do everything we can to achieve our maximum-employment and price- stability goals.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","as I—as I referred to in my opening statement,",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","it’s—it is not possible to predict with much confidence exactly what path for our policy rate is going to prove appropriate.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","And so, at this time, we haven’t made any decisions about the path of policy.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","And I stress again that we’ll be humble and nimble.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","We’re going to have to navigate crosscurrents and actually two-sided risks now.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","So—and, and I’ll say also that we’re going to be guided by the data.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","what I’ll say is that we’re going to be led by the incoming data and the evolving outlook,",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","which we’ll try to communicate as clearly as possible,",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","we know that the economy is in a very different place than it was when we began raising rates in 2015.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","Specifically, the economy is now much stronger.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","The labor market is far stronger.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","Inflation is running well above our 2 percent target,",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","much higher than it was at that time.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","And these differences are likely to have important implications for the appropriate pace of policy adjustments.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","Beyond that, we haven’t made any decisions.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","Just getting both, both parts of your question written down.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","So I would say—and this view is widely held on the Committee—that both sides of the mandate are calling for us to move steadily away from the very highly accommodative policies we put in place during the challenging economic conditions that the economy faced earlier in the pandemic.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","And I would say that most FOMC participants agree that labor market conditions are consistent with maximum employment in the sense of the highest level of employment that is consistent with price stability.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","And that is—that is my personal view.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","very broad support on the Committee for the judgment that it will soon be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","will evolve over time and through the course of the business cycle.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","In the particular situation we’re in now, it may well increase.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","Max—the level of maximum—of employment that’s consistent with stable prices may increase.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","as more people come back into the labor market,",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","And the policy path that we’re broadly contemplating would be supportive of that comment—that outcome as well.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","So the thing about the labor market right now is that there are—there are many millions of,",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","of more job openings than there are unemployed people.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","So you ask whether we can— whether we can raise rates and,",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","and move to less accommodative,",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","Record levels of job openings, of quits.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","Wages are moving up at the highest pace they have in decades.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","If you look at surveys of workers, they find jobs plentiful.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","Look at surveys of companies—they find workers scarce.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","And all of those readings are at levels,",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","that we haven’t seen in a long time—and,",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","and my strong sense is that we can—we can—we can move rates up without,",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","I also would point out that there are—there are other forces at work this year,",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","which should also help bring down inflation,",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","including improvement on the supply side,",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","The timing and pace of that are uncertain.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","fiscal policy is going to be less supportive of,",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","of growth this year—not of the level of economic activity,",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","but the fiscal impulse to growth will be significantly lower.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","So there are multiple forces—which should be working over the course of the year for inflation to come down.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","We do realize that the timing and pace of that are,",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","are highly uncertain and that inflation has persisted longer than we—than we thought.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","we’re prepared to use our tools to assure that higher inflation does not become entrenched.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","So I’m afraid to tell you that those are all great questions,",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","and they’re questions that the Committee is just turning to now.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","So we had—we had a discussion,",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","an introductory discussion of the balance sheet and a teeing up of the issues.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","we’ve gone through and carefully put together a set of principles at a high level.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","And those are meant to guide the actual decisions we’ll make about the pace and about all of the questions that you’re,",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","And I expect that this process will,",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","will be something that we spend time on in coming meetings.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","I can’t tell you how long it will take.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","But—and then, you know, at the appropriate time, we’ll provide additional information.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","So I did—the last cycle when we—when we went through balance sheet issues,",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","over the course of two or three meetings,",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","we did come to interesting and better answers,",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","So we’re just in that process now.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","more of the details that you’re—that you’re asking about.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","The balance sheet is, is much bigger.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","I’d say it has a shorter duration than the last time.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","And the economy’s much stronger, and inflation is much higher.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","So—and I think that leads you to—and I said,",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","I’ve said this—being willing to move sooner than we did the last time and also perhaps faster.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","it’s really—it’s really not appropriate for me to speculate exactly what that would be.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","and—but I would point you to principle number one,",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","which is “the Committee views changes in the target range for the federal funds rate as its primary means of adjusting the stance of monetary policy.” So we do want the federal funds rate—we,",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","we want to operationalize that [as the primary means].",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","we think of the balance sheet as,",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","as moving in a predictable manner,",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","and that the active tool meeting to meeting is not both of them,",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","There are—there are rules of thumb—I’m reluctant to land on one of them—that,",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","And—but there’s also an element of, of uncertainty around the balance sheet.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","I think we have a much better sense,",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","of how rate increases affect financial conditions and,",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","is still a relatively new thing for,",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","so we’re less certain about that.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","our—I think our—the pattern we’ll follow is to—is to arrive at a,",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","a timing and a pace and composition and all those things and then announce that with advance notice,",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","and it will—it will start in the background.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","And then we’ll look to have that just running in the background and have—and have the interest rates,",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","be the active tool of monetary policy.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","That’s, that’s at least the plan.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","I can’t tell you much more about any of the— any of the very good issues about size,",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","But we’ll be turning to all of those at coming meetings.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","the ultimate focus that we have is on the real economy:",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","maximum employment and price stability.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","And financial conditions matter to the extent that they have implications for achieving the dual mandate.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","we look at broader financial conditions,",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","And what we’re always asking ourselves is,",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","are we seeing changes that are both persistent and material enough that—of a change in financial conditions—that they are inconsistent with the achievement of our goals?",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","So that’s how we’re looking at that.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","And I don’t want to comment on today’s financial conditions broadly,",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","but we’re not looking at any one market or,",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","In terms of what we’ve seen, I would say this.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","we said at our last meeting we published the Summary of Economic Projections,",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","the median of which—the median participant expected three rate increases this year.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","And, you know, it’s six weeks, seven weeks later now.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","And you have seen that our communication channel with the markets is working.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","Markets are, are now pricing in a number of rate increases.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","Surveys show that market participants are expecting a balance sheet runoff to begin,",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","sometime later this year perhaps.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","We haven’t made that decision yet.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","we feel like the communications we have with market participants and with the general public are working and",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","We haven’t got—we haven’t gotten to that point yet.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","We haven’t made a decision yet, and we’ll make that decision at the March meeting.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","We’ll make a decision whether to raise the federal funds rate.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","I would say that the Committee is,",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","to raise the federal funds rate at the March meeting,",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","assuming that conditions are appropriate for doing so.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","We have—we have our eyes on, on the risks, particularly around the world.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","But we do expect some softening in the economy from Omicron,",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","but we think that that should be temporary.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","And we think that the economy should—the underlying strength of the economy should,",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","should—show through fairly quickly after that.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","I think the path is highly uncertain and that we’re committed to using our tools to make sure that inflation,",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","high inflation that we’re seeing,",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","So a number of factors would be—it’s not just monetary policy—a number of that it will come slower than,",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","than we had expected and hoped—that there will be relief on the supply side.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","should—should lower the supply-side barriers,",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","which are a big part of the story of why inflation is high.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","In addition, monetary policy will be becoming significantly less accommodative.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","we’ll be asking this question all year long,",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","are things turning out as we expect?",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","the economy slows more and inflation slows more than expected;",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","we see inflation at a higher level or a more persistent level,",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","we’re well aware that this is a different economy than—than existed during the last tightening cycle,",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","and our policy is going to reflect those differences.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","So let me—let me—let me start by talking about that last paragraph.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","So you’ll remember during the last cycle that this process of building up and then shrinking the balance sheet is a complicated one,",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","we amended our balance sheet principles a number of times.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","Now, we didn’t intend to do that.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","It just—events required us to do so.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","So we got a pretty robust paragraph there that says we’re free to do this at any time.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","And it doesn’t mean we’re going to,",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","but if the situation turns out to be different than we had thought,",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","we’re not going to be—we’re not going to stick with something that isn’t working.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","It’s meant to be quite a general statement rather than a, a hint.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","our philosophy of the balance sheet is,",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","is embodied in these principles.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","the federal funds rate is the primary means of adjusting the stance of policy,",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","that we’ll use—determine the timing and pace of reducing the size of the balance sheet to foster the dual mandate,",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","that we’ll begin to reduce the size after we begin the process of raising rates,",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","that— those are all the things that,",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","that try to describe how we will proceed.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","function, as they were at—right after the—in the critical phase of the Global Financial Crisis.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","And then after [that], they were a macroeconomic tool to support demand.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","And now the economy no longer needs this,",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","this highly accommodative policy that we put in place.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","So it’s time to stop asset purchases first and then,",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","start to shrink the balance sheet.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","Now, the balance sheet is, is substantially larger than it needs to be.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","We’ve identified the end state as—in amounts needed to implement monetary policy efficiently [and] effectively in the ample-reserves regime.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","So there’s a substantial amount of, of shrinkage in the balance sheet to be done.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","That’s going to take some time.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","We want that process to be orderly and predictable.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","And so those are some of the ways that I would think this,",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","the way we—the way we’re thinking about this.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","In terms of the timing, I can’t really help you.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","You know, it just says after, after we get under way.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","we’re going to have another discussion at,",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","we’ll have at least one other discussion at the meeting after that.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","And, you know, we’ll, we’ll tell you as we make progress.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","we’ll start the process of allowing runoff and shrinking the balance sheet at what we find to be the appropriate time.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","But, honestly, we haven’t made those decisions.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","And we actually haven’t even really had the,",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","the important discussions on a lot of the details that we will have at coming meetings.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","So you asked about the risks first.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","the one risk is that inflation risks are still to the upside in the views of most FOMC participants and,",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","that the high inflation we’re seeing will be prolonged,",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","and there’s a risk that it will move even higher.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","So we don’t—we don’t think that’s the base case,",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","but you asked what the risks are.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","And that’s—we have to be in a position with our monetary policy to address all of the plausible outcomes.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","And that calls for us to be in position.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","we have an expectation about the way the economy is going to be evolved,",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","but we’ve got to be in a position to,",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","including the one where inflation remains higher.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","And, of course, that is a risk to the—to the—to the expansion.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","we’ve been saying that what we need here is another long expansion,",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","which is the kind of thing we saw over the last [one],",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","which was a record long expansion.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","We saw labor force participation rise.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","We saw wages persistently higher for people at the lower end,",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","there really was no obvious So we’d love to find a way to get back to that.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","That’s going to require price stability,",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","and that’s going to require the Fed to tighten interest rate policy and do our part in getting inflation back down to our 2 percent goal.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","So I mentioned two-sided risks.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","And COVID can continue to evolve,",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","and it’s just—we have to accept that it’s not over,",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","and the risks to it can slow down growth.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","And that would be—that’s sort of a downside risk from a growth standpoint.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","further problems in the supply chains,",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","which could slow down activity.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","And you see the situation in China as a situation there where that’s—their no-COVID policy may cause more lockdowns,",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","and that may play into—may play into more problems in supply chains.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","In addition, there’s what’s going on in Eastern Europe and things like that.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","So there’s plenty of risk out there.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","And we, you know, we can’t—we can’t forget that there are risks on both sides.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","I know you’ve been all over this issue with,",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","We don’t—we don’t have that information at the Board.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","I hand— I asked the inspector general to do an investigation,",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","And I don’t—I really—I can’t help you here today on this issue.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","I would say that the inflation situation is about the same but probably slightly worse.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","I’d be inclined to raise my own estimate of 2022 core PCE inflation—let’s just go with that—by a few tenths today.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","But we’re not writing, writing down an SEP at this meeting.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","But I think it’s—it hasn’t gotten better.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","It’s probably gotten just a—just a bit worse, and that’s been the pattern.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","So I think if you look at the—the FOMC participants are—there’s a range there.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","And that range has been moving to the right for, for a year now.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","if you look at other forecasters,",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","essentially all other macro forecasters who do this for a living,",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","So, what do we think about that?",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","we wrote down rate increases in the December meetings,",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","And I think to the extent the situation deteriorates further,",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","our policy will have to address that,",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","if it deteriorates meaningfully further,",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","either in the time dimension or in the size of the inflation dimension.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","So that’s how we’re thinking about it.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","over time, to a policy that’s not accommodative, in time.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","I don’t know when that will be.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","That’s—those are the things that we’re—that we’re thinking about.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","Another part of it is that fiscal policy provided an impulse to growth over the last two years.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","That impulse will be less, in fact, will be—will be negative this year.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","The other one is, we will eventually get relief on the supply side.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","And, you know, the ports will be cleared up.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","And there will be semiconductors and things like that.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","Now, what we’re learning is, it’s just taking much longer, so I think—longer than expected.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","raise the risk that high inflation will be more persistent.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","I do think we’ll come off of the highs that we saw in the early part of this episode in the—in the spring last year.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","But, really, what’s—the question is going to be, what is inflation running at?",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","And so we’ll be watching that.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","And I, you know, we—our objective is to get inflation back down to 2 percent.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","It’s also to provide enough support to keep the labor market healthy.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","and I think that that strength will continue.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","There’s a—there’s really a shortage of workers.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","We see it particularly among production and nonsupervisory workers and people in the lowest quartile.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","You see very large wage increases.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","I mentioned some of the other indicators.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","So I think that’s, that’s what we’re looking at.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","that this outlook is quite uncertain and that we’re going to have to adapt.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","And we’re going to communicate as clearly as we can.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","But we’re going to have to be adaptable and, you know, move, move as appropriate.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","So, as I mentioned, we have not made these decisions.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","is that we fully appreciate that this is a different situation.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","If you look back to where we were in 2015,",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","’18 when we were raising rates,",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","inflation was very close to 2 percent,",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","Unemployment was, was not at our estimates of the natural rate.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","And growth was, you know, in the 2 to 3 percent range.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","we have inflation running substantially above 2 percent and,",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","more persistently than we would like.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","We have growth—even in forecasts,",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","even in the somewhat reduced forecast for 2022—we still see growth higher than,",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","substantially higher than what we estimate to be the potential growth rate.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","And we see a labor market where, by so many measures, it is historically tight.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","the least tight aspect of it is,",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","is looking at the unemployment rate,",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","which is still below our median estimate of,",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","of [the unemployment rate consistent with] maximum employment.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","If you look at things like quits and job openings,",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","and just the ratio of job openings to unemployed—you’re seeing a very,",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","Now, we also know that labor force participation is significantly lower.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","It’s 1½ percentage points lower than it was in February of 2020.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","Maybe a [full] percentage point of could come back into the labor force.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","But it’s not happening very quickly,",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","and it may not—it may continue to not happen very quickly as long as the pandemic is on[going].",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","So that’s, that’s, that’s how we think about that.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","We haven’t made—to your specific question—we really have not addressed those questions.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","And we’ll begin to address them as we—as we move into the March meeting and meetings after that.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","it’s more a matter of—I think the problem that we’re—that we’re talking about here is really that people who are on fixed incomes who are living paycheck to paycheck,",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","they’re spending most or all of their—of,",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","of what they’re earning on food,",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","right away forces people like that to make very difficult decisions.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","inflation literally falling more on,",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","The point is, some people are just really in a—prone to suffer more.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","I mean, for people who are economically well off, inflation isn’t good.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","but they’re going to be able to continue to eat and keep their homes and drive that it’s particularly hard on people with fixed incomes and low incomes who spent most of their—of their income on necessities,",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","which are—which are experiencing high inflation now.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","I would not say that I would expect the supply chain issues to be completely worked out by the end of this year.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","I do not expect them, and I have not expected them.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","is that I expect progress to be made in the second half of this year,",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","mainly—progress because we’re not making much progress.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","If you look at a ton of metrics,",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","you can find some that suggest that delivery times are shorter and inventories in some industries moving up.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","But, overall, we’re not—we’re not making progress.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","things like the semiconductor issue are going to—they’re going to be quite a long time.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","I would think they’ll go more than through 2023.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","possibility that inflation will continue to run higher, more persistently than we’d expected.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","And we think we are positioned to make the changes in our policy to do that,",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","and we’re committed to doing that.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","And that’s, that’s really where we are.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","we haven’t—we haven’t faced those decisions.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","It isn’t possible to sit down here today and tell you with any confidence what the—what the precise path will be.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","But in—as we work our way through this,",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","we are aware that this is a very different,",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","And I think those differences are likely to be reflected in—in the policy that we implement.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","There’s no—there’s nothing in our framework about having inflation run below 2 percent so that we would do that, try to achieve that outcome.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","So the answer to that is, is “no.” What we’re trying to do is get inflation, keep inflation expectations well anchored at 2 percent.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","That’s, that’s always the, the ultimate goal.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","And we do that in the expectations would be anchored at 2 percent.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","So that, that’s the way we think about that.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","You know, it—what was the last part of your—of your question?",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","I mean, I would say you have a tremendously strong labor market.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","And you have growth this year at—forecast to be well above—well above potential.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","I mean, people who are forecasting growth think potential growth is around 2 [percent].",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","Most forecasts [of actual growth] are significantly above that for 2022,",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","with policy becoming substantially less accommodative.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","So the labor market’s going to be strong for some time.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","We’re—ideally, what we’re trying to achieve is inflation getting back down to 2 percent.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","And we’re trying to do that in a process that,",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","that will also leave the labor market in a very strong position.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","And no one really knows what that will take.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","Again, I would say that it isn’t just monetary policy that’s helping inflation get down.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","less fiscal impulse in all likelihood.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","So—but monetary policy will do our job.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","It is our job to get inflation down to 2 percent.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","where the two goals are—the two goals can be in tension is a difficult one.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","But I—but I don’t really think they are here,",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","because I think a really significant threat to further strengthening in the labor market in the form of higher participation over time is high inflation.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","And also, high inflation is taking away the benefits of some of these larger wage",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","State dependency was particularly around the thought that if we—if we saw a very strong labor market, we would wait to see actual inflation—actual inflation before we tightened.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","And so that was a very state-dependent thought because, for a long time, we’d been tightening on the expectation of high inflation, which never appeared.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","And that was the case for, for a number of years.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","So in this particular situation, we will be clearly monitoring incoming data as well as the evolving outlook.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","So I think it’s too soon to write that history, really.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","The—if you remember what it felt like at the beginning of the pandemic,",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","literally the global economy shutting down in large part,",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","and people going to their homes for weeks on end in masks,",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","and it could be a really long And I think Congress responded remarkably with the—with the CARES Act,",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","incredibly timely and very powerful.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","People will—there’ll always be flaws in these things.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","But in real time, it was a remarkable achievement.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","And what we were able to do was,",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","stave off a collapse of the financial system at the beginning and make time for what really needed to happen,",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","which was the income replacement and then the recovery that Congress enabled with the CARES Act.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","So now, that was a lot of—that was a lot.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","we have the strongest recovery of any,",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","And we have—we have a recovery that looks completely unlike other recoveries that we’ve had,",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","we’ve put so much support behind the recovery.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","the relatively high-class problems that come with that,",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","which are high inflation and a labor shortage.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","So—and these are serious problems,",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","very serious problems that we,",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","we’re working as hard as we can on.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","Again, I’m going to leave that to the historians.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","we’ll look back at this incident,",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","we’ll have a—we’ll have a much better basis to make a judgment about the actions that people took.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","in a—in a very strong reaction to a,",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","And I guess I’ll have to leave it at that.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","I look for—I hope I’ll be around to see how that looks in 25 years.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","we do monitor the slope of the yield curve,",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","but we don’t control the slope of the yield curve.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","Many flat—many factors influence longer-term interest rates.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","But it is something that we watch,",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","and you will know that from when we had this issue a few years ago.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","along with many other financial conditions,",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","as we try to assess the implications of all those conditions for the economic outlook.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","So that’s, that’s one thing I would say.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","Another is, currently, you’ve got a slope.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","2-year Treasury to 10-year Treasury,",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","I think that’s around 75 basis points.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","That’s well within the range of a normal—of a normal yield-curve slope.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","So it’s something we’re monitoring.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","We don’t think of it as—I don’t think of it as some kind of an iron law.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","But we do look at it and try to understand the implications and what it’s telling us.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","And it’s—but it’s one of many things that we monitor.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","We’d—that’s, that’s a good question in, in real time.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","I would describe what we’re doing along these lines.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","This is going to be a year in which we move steadily away from the very highly accommodative monetary policy that we put in place to deal with the—with the economic effects of the pandemic.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","And that’s going to involve a number of things.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","It’s going to involve and does involve finishing asset purchases.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","It’s going to involve lifting off.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","And it’s going to involve additional rate increases as appropriate.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","we have—we’re going to write down in March our next assessment of what that might be.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","It’s going to continue to evolve as the data evolve.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","We need to be quite adaptable, I think, in our understanding of this.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","The last thing we’re going to do is,",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","we’re going to have a couple more meetings,",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","to talk about allowing the balance sheet to begin to run off and [to] do so in a predictable manner.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","And that’s, that’s something that we will also be doing as appropriate.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","And I wouldn’t—I don’t think it’s possible to say exactly how this is going to go.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","And we’re, we’re going to need to be, as I’ve mentioned, nimble about this.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","And the economy is quite different this time.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","I’ve said this several times now.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","The economy is quite different.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","The labor market is much, much stronger than it was.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","And growth is above trend, even this year, let alone last year.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","So all of those things are going to go into our thinking as we make—as we make monetary policy.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","We, we, of course, have a financial stability framework.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","And what it shows is a number of, of positive aspects of financial stability.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","But you mentioned, really, [the behavior of] asset prices is one of the four.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","So asset prices are somewhat elevated,",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","and they reflect a high risk appetite and that sort of thing.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","I don’t really think asset prices themselves represent a significant threat to financial stability,",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","and that’s because households are in good shape financially than they have been.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","Businesses are in good shape financially.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","Defaults on business loans are low and that kind of thing.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","The banks are highly capitalized with high liquidity and quite resilient and strong.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","There are some concerns in the—in the nonbank financial sector around—still around money market funds,",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","although the SEC is making—has made some very positive proposals there.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","And we also saw some things in the Treasury market during the acute phase of the crisis,",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","which we’re looking at ways to address.",""
"2022-01-26","Q&A","But, overall, the financial stability vulnerabilities are manageable—are manageable, I would say.",""
"2022-03-16","Opening Statement","I want to begin by acknowledging the tremendous hardship the Ukrainian people are suffering as a result of Russia’s invasion.",""
"2022-03-16","Opening Statement","The financial and economic implications for the global economy and the",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","So I guess I would start by saying that,",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","the probability of a recession within the next year is not particularly elevated.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","Aggregate demand is currently strong, and most forecasters expect it to remain so.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","If you look at the labor market, [you find that it is] also very strong.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","and payroll job growth is withstand,",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","but certainly flourish—as well in the face of less accommodative monetary policy.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","So I guess that’s how I would say I’m looking at that.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","the objective is to achieve price stability while also sustaining a strong labor market.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","And that is our overall objective.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","But we do feel the economy is very strong and well positioned to withstand tighter monetary policy.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","I don’t think that’s a big piece of it, actually.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","I think some of that is just an early assessment of the effects of spillovers from the war in Eastern Europe,",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","which will hit our economy through a number of channels.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","Highly uncertain, but, you know, you’re looking at higher oil prices, higher commodity prices.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","It’ll be—we think that will weigh on GDP to some extent.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","So that’s part of what moved those assessments down.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","monetary policy works with a lag,",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","so some of that would also be in there.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","But remember, as well, that 2.8 percent is still very strong growth.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","If we think that the potential growth rate of the economy is somewhere between,",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","2.8 percent is strong economic growth.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","It would have been one of the strongest years, in fact, of the last expansion.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","So, while it’s lower than last year’s 5.8 percent, it’s still quite strong growth.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","So I would say it’s quite a strong forecast.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","come in bigger chunks or evenly paced through the year.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","So, you know, the way we’re thinking about this is that every meeting is a live meeting.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","And we’re going to be looking at evolving conditions.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","And if we do conclude that it would be appropriate to move more quickly to remove accommodation, then we’ll do so.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","I can’t be perfectly specific about it, but that’s certainly a possibility as we go through the year.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","So I guess I would say that at the—before the invasion of Ukraine by Russia—so let’s go back to that.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","I would have said that the expectation was that inflation would peak sometime in the first quarter,",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","maybe the end of the first quarter of this year,",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","and then maybe stay at that level or a little bit lower and then start to come down in the back half of the year.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","we’re getting—we’re going—we’re already seeing a little bit of short- term upward pressure in inflation due to higher oil prices,",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","natural gas [prices] a little bit but not so much for us since we have our own natural gas supply,",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","going to mean more tangled supply chains.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","So that could actually push out [in time] the relief we were expecting on supply chains generally.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","So I guess I would say that the expectation is still that inflation will begin to come down in the second half of the year.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","But if you look at where I read the SEP headline median,",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","we still expect inflation to be high this year,",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","particularly with the effects of the war,",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","but also the data we’ve seen so far this year—we expect inflation to remain high through the middle of the year,",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","and then come down more sharply next year.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","So that’s one of many ways of capturing the situation,",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","which is that we—the Committee really does understand that the time for rate increases and for shrinking the balance sheet has come.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","I would go back to “the economy is very strong,” as I mentioned.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","Tremendous momentum in the labor market.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","As I—it’s clearly time to raise interest rates and begin the balance sheet shrinkage.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","determined to use our tools to do exactly that.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","You couched it in terms of real rates.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","you’ve got people getting close to or even above,",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","their estimate of the longer-run neutral rate.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","So I understand that doesn’t do it for real rates.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","But if you go out a year or two,",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","are having tight policy from a real interest rate standpoint.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","So that’s something that we’re focused on.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","Of course, it’s a highly uncertain environment.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","And, you know, we don’t know what’s going to happen.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","But we do know that we’re going to deploy our tools to achieve our goals—and that includes the price-stability goal.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","Tell me again your first question.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","So I don’t—Neil, I’ve never talked about my own SEP projection.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","I think Fed Chairs have generally not done that,",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","because we just haven’t done it.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","we have to put together the consensus on the Committee and present that consensus.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","So I wouldn’t talk about my individual one.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","And in terms of the pacing of it,",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","I would just point out that that is—there’s seven remaining meetings this year.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","This isn’t something we discuss or debate or agree on.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","But there’s seven remaining meetings, and there’s seven rate hikes.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","I would add there’s also the shrinkage of the balance sheet,",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","you people do the math different ways,",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","but that might be the equivalent of another rate increase just from the runoff of the balance sheet.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","We haven’t made any decisions on front-end loading or going steadily through the year.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","a good number of participants do see more than seven or eight increases this year.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","I’m not going to try to give you a really specific test for what it would take to do that.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","that we’ll be And we’ll be going—each meeting is a live meeting.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","And if we conclude that it would be appropriate to raise interest rates more quickly,",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","So I just would say a couple things.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","We have the tools that we need, and we’re going to use them.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","we have a plan over the course of this year to raise interest rates steadily and also to run off the balance sheet.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","We will take the necessary steps to ensure that high inflation does not become entrenched,",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","while also supporting a strong labor market.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","if we conclude that it would be appropriate to move more quickly,",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","I’ll leave it to others to make the judgment you asked for.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","We lost you in the middle of the question.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","So, of course, that’s something we’re watching report by report.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","And we’re certainly, we noticed it in the last meeting.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","And it’s part of the overall picture.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","We have expected services inflation to move back up to where it was,",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","and that’s part of what’s happening is,",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","prices are still getting back up to where they were before the crisis.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","In other cases, it’s pretty clear that inflation has spread more broadly across services.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","In the meanwhile, we see some progress on the good side.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","the Committee acutely feels its obligation to move to make sure that we restore price stability and is determined to use its tools to do so.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","So our, if you look, our—first of all, there is no—you’re looking at medians.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","But understand that there’s no, it’s not something we voted on.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","people do have their in—by the end of this year,",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","above their estimates of longer-run neutral interest rate.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","So that should stop pushing—that should,",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","that should be a removal of accommodation for monetary policy,",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","At the same time, we will have done significant balance sheet runoff.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","And you can think of that as further.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","and just looking at the median,",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","what people estimate to be the longer-run median.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","So why does unemployment remain at 3.5 percent?",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","You know, it—I mean, a couple points.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","One is the connection between—in the economy we had before the pandemic,",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","the connection between inflation and the level of the unemployment rate was not very tight.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","long run with 2 percent inflation,",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","will move back down to levels which are still very attractive,",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","full-economy kind of—full-employment kind of wages,",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","but not to a point where they’re pushing up inflation anymore.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","And, as I mentioned, there are a lot of factors causing inflation to come down.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","and we don’t know what will actually happen.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","this is a Committee that is determined to use its tools to make sure that higher inflation does not become entrenched.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","And so we are determined on that front, and we’ll deal with what comes.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","This is a modal, or most likely, expectation.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","But we’ll deal with what comes, whether it’s better or worse.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","if you take a look at today’s labor market,",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","what you have is 1.7-plus job openings for every unemployed person.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","very tight labor market— tight to an unhealthy level,",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","if you were—let’s say that our tools work about as you described,",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","we’re trying to better align demand and supply,",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","let’s just say in the labor market.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","if you were just moving down the number of job openings so that they were more like one to one,",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","you would have less upward pressure on We’re hearing from companies that they can’t hire enough people.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","They’re having a hard time hiring.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","So that’s really the thinking there,",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","these are fairly well-understood channels,",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","we’d like to slow demand so that it’s better aligned with supply;",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","a better alignment of supply and demand.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","And that, over time, should bring inflation down.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","we don’t have a perfect crystal ball about the future,",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","and we’re prepared to use our tools as needed to restore price stability.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","as I mentioned in my opening remarks,",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","there—you really can’t have a sustained period of maximum employment.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","It’s our—one of our most fundamental obligations is to maintain and restore,",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","So we’re very committed to that.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","the plan is to restore price stability while also sustaining a strong labor market.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","That is our intention, and we believe we can do that.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","But we have to restore price stability.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","So, as you know, policy works through financial conditions.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","That’s how it reaches the real economy—by just the mechanisms you mentioned.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","And remember that the financial conditions we had for the last couple of years were a function not only of very aggressive,",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","but also highly accommodative monetary policy—the monetary policy settings that we put in place at the worst parts of the pandemic.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","So it is very appropriate to move away from those.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","that will lead to some tightening in financial conditions in the form of higher interest rates and just the sorts of things—we’re not targeting any one or more of those things,",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","but financial conditions generally should move to a more normal level so that—because we know the economy no longer needs,",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","so it’s time to move to a more normal setting of financial conditions,",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","and we do that by moving monetary policy itself to more normal levels.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","So I would say, we look at a broad range of financial conditions.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","And, of course, when we tighten monetary policy, we do expect that they will adjust in sync over time with monetary policy.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","It’s not any particular financial condition, but a broad range of financial conditions.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","They will reflect to some extent—they reflect any number of things.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","But, yes, we need our policy to transmit to the real economy.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","And it does so through financial conditions, which means that, as we tighten policy or remove accommodation so that",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","at our meeting today and yesterday,",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","we made excellent progress toward agreeing on the parameters of a plan to shrink the balance sheet.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","And I’d say we’re now in a position to finalize and implement that plan so that we’ll actually begin a runoff at a coming meeting.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","And that could come as soon as our next meeting in May.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","That’s not a decision that we’ve made.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","But I would say that that’s how well our discussions went in the last two days.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","So a couple things just to add.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","We’ll be mindful of the broader financial and economic context when we make the decision on timing,",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","and we always want to use our tools to support macroeconomic and financial stability.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","We want to avoid adding uncertainty to what’s a highly uncertain situation already.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","So all of that will go into the thinking of the timing around this.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","In terms of the—I would say this.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","I don’t want to get too much into the details,",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","because we’re literally just finalizing them.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","But the framework is going to look very familiar to people who are familiar with the last time we did this.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","But it’ll be faster than the last time.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","And, of course, it’s much sooner in a cycle than last time.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","But it will look familiar to you.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","And I would also say that there’ll be—I’m sure there’ll be a more detailed discussion of our—in the minutes",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","So I want to clear one thing up again.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","And that is that nothing in our new framework or in the changes that we made has caused us to wait longer to raise interest rates.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","What we said in the framework changes was—and this was really a reflection of what had happened for the preceding couple of decades,",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","then we’re not going to raise rates ’til we actually see inflation.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","That’s what we said, and that was the sense of it.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","if we got a burst of really high inflation,",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","That’s simply not in the framework.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","The framework is all about anchoring inflation expectations at 2 percent.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","So I do hear this, you know, that the framework—really, we can’t blame the framework.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","It was a sudden, unexpected burst of inflation.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","And then it was the reaction to it, and it was what it was.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","But it was not in any way caused by or related to the framework.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","You know, I think our vision on this on the Committee is very, very clear.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","What we see is a strong labor market.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","We see a labor market with a lot of momentum, great job creation.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","And we see the underlying economy’s strong.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","Yes, there are threats to growth But inflation is far above our target.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","the help we’ve been expecting and other forecasters have been expecting from supply-side improvement,",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","all those things getting better—it hasn’t come.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","And so we’re looking now to using our tools to restore price stability,",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","and we’re committed to doing that.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","And you see that, I think, in the Summary of Economic Projections.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","And you see that in the decision we make,",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","and you’ll continue to see it in the decisions we make,",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","is to restore price stability while also sustaining a strong labor market.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","We have a dual mandate, and they’re sort of equal.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","But, as I said earlier, you know, price stability is an essential goal.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","for achieving the kind of labor market that we want,",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","which is a strong and sustained labor market.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","We saw the benefits of a long expansion, a sustained labor market.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","and there were really no imbalances in the economy that threatened the long expansion.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","It, just, the pandemic arrived; it was just a completely exogenous event.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","So that’s how we’re thinking about it.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","We, of course, want to achieve, you know, price stability with a strong labor market.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","But we do understand also that,",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","you can’t have maximum employment for any sustained period without price stability.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","So we need to focus on price stability particularly,",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","because the labor market is so strong and the economy is so strong.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","We feel like the economy can handle tighter monetary policy.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","Wanted to ask just kind of the broad question about how you are communicating what the Fed’s doing here today to the average American who might not be reading the dot plots or understanding what the SEP is.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","How is the 25 basis point hike today and then the signaling on future Fed policy going to address the inflation that they’re feeling at the stores on a daily basis?",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","So I guess I’d start by just assuring everyone that we’re fully committed to bringing inflation back down and also sustaining the economic expansion.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","We do understand that these higher prices,",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","have real effects on people’s well- being.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","And, really, high inflation takes a toll on everyone.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","on people who use most of their income to buy essentials like food,",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","we’ve all seen charts that show,",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","if you’re a middle-income person,",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","you’ve got room to absorb some inflation.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","If you’re at the lower end of the income spectrum,",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","it’s very hard because you’re spending most of your money already on necessities,",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","But it’s punishing for everyone.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","So it has been a difficult time for the economy.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","But we do anticipate that inflation will move back down, as I mentioned earlier.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","It may take longer than we like,",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","but I’m confident that we’ll use our tools to bring inflation down.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","that should gradually slow down demand for the interest-sensitive parts of the economy.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","And so what we would see is demand slowing down,",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","but just enough so that it’s better matched with supply.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","And that brings—that will bring inflation down over time.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","I think we do understand very much,",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","and we very much take to heart,",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","that it’s our obligation to restore price stability.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","we’ve had price stability for a very long time and maybe come to take it for granted.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","I’m old enough to remember what very high inflation was like.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","we’re strongly committed as a Committee to not allowing this higher inflation to become entrenched and to use our tools to bring inflation back down to more normal levels,",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","which—our target is 2 percent inflation.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","And I just would want people to understand that,",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","and that’s—but the way we do that is by raising interest rates and by shrinking our balance sheet.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","And so financial conditions will become,",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","less supportive of various kinds of economic activity.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","That will slow the economy, while also allowing the labor market to remain very strong.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","the economy and the labor market are quite strong.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","And that means the economy, we think, can handle interest rate increases.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","Well, I, you know, I say that our intention is to bring inflation back down to 2 percent, while still sustaining a strong labor market and that the economy is very strong.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","If you look at where forecasts are, people are forecasting growth that’s strong within the context of",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","Well, so, of course, central bankers around the world are generally very in favor of these sanctions.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","But let me say this: Sanctions are really the business of the elected government, and that’s true everywhere.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","So the Administration and the Treasury comment on sanctions really much because, again, they’re not for us [to decide].",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","We have a very specific mandate.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","And these are really the province of elected governments, as I mentioned.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","So I’d have to leave it at that.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","So the way I would say it is this:",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","I would agree with the premise that wages moving up is a great thing.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","You know, that’s how the standard of living rises over time.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","And, generally, it’s driven over long periods by rising productivity.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","the wage increases that we have,",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","we look at a—we’re blessed with a range of measures of wages that all measure different things.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","they’re all showing the same thing,",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","which is that the increases—not the levels,",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","but the increases—are running at levels that are well above what would be consistent with 2 percent inflation,",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","And that may be—we don’t know how persistent that phenomenon will be.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","the sense of your question about a wage–price spiral;",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","is that something that’s going to start happening and become entrenched in the system?",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","in some sectors that got very high wage increases early on,",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","those wage increases looked like they may have slowed down to a normal level.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","what I’m saying here—which is,",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","there’s a misalignment of demand and supply,",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","guide inflation back down to 2 percent.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","And that would be in the context of an extraordinarily strong labor market.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","We think this labor market can handle, as I mentioned, tighter monetary policy.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","And the overall economy can as well.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","wages are moving up faster than is consistent with 2 percent inflation,",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","but it’s good to see that moving up.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","But it wouldn’t be sustainable over too long of a period to see them moving up that much higher.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","And that’s because of this misalignment between supply and demand.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","We expect to get more labor supply.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","We got more than we expected during the last cycle.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","This time, we’ve gotten much less than expected.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","So it’s not easy to predict these things.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","But we do expect that we’ll get people coming back in the labor market,",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","particularly as COVID becomes less and less of a factor in many people’s lives,",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","But, so that’s how we think about it.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","So we are not—we don’t have the luxury of 20/20 hindsight in actually implementing real-time decisions in the world.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","so the question is—the right question is,",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","did you make the right decisions based on what you knew at the time?",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","But that’s not the question I was answering, which is knowing what you know now.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","So I think if we what was going to happen, then in hindsight, yes.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","It would have been appropriate to move earlier.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","But, again, we don’t have that luxury.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","but that’s a separate question from your other question,",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","which is “behind the curve.” And,",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","I don’t have the luxury of looking at it that way.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","we have our tools—powerful tools—and the Committee is very focused on using them.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","We’re acutely aware of the need to restore price stability while keeping a strong labor market.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","And what I saw today was a Committee that is strongly committed to achieving price stability,",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","and prepared to use our tools to do that.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","We’re not going to let high inflation become entrenched.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","The costs of that would be too high.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","And we’re not going to wait so long that we have to do that.",""
"2022-03-16","Q&A","No one wants to have to really put restrictive monetary policy on,",""

"2022-05-04","Q&A","There’s a path by which we would be able to have demand moderate in the labor market and therefore have vacancies come down without unemployment going up,",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","because vacancies are at such an extraordinarily high level.",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","There’re 1.9 vacancies for every unemployed person, 11.5 million vacancies, 6 million unemployed people.",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","So we haven’t been in that place on the vacancy,",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","sort of the vacancy/unemployed curve,",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","We haven’t been at that sort of level of a ratio in the modern era.",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","it seems as though by moderating demand,",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","we could see vacancies come down and,",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","as a result—and they could come down fairly significantly and,",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","put supply and demand at least closer together than they are.",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","And that would give us a chance to get inflation down,",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","and then get inflation down without having to slow the economy and have a recession and have unemployment rise materially.",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","I think we have a good chance to have a soft or softish landing or outcome,",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","And I’ll give you a couple of reasons for that.",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","One is, households and businesses are in very strong financial shape.",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","excess savings on balance sheets—excess in the sense that they’re substantially larger than the prior trend.",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","Businesses are in good financial shape.",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","The labor market is, as I mentioned, very, very strong.",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","And so it doesn’t seem to be anywhere close to a downturn.",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","Therefore, the economy is strong and is well positioned to handle tighter monetary policy.",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","So, but I’ll say, I do expect that this that’s what we’re going to do.",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","So a 75-basis-point increase is not something the Committee is actively considering.",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","What we are doing is, we raised [the funds rate by] 50 basis points today.",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","assuming that economic and financial conditions evolve in ways that are consistent with our expectations,",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","there’s a broad sense on the Committee that additional 50- basis-point increases should be on the table for the next couple of meetings.",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","So we’re going to make those decisions at the meetings,",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","and we’ll be paying close attention to the incoming data and the evolving outlook as well as to financial conditions.",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","we will be communicating to the public about what our expectations will be as they evolve.",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","So the test is really just as I laid it out—economic and financial conditions evolving broadly in line with expectations.",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","I think expectations are that we’ll start to see inflation,",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","flattening out—and not necessarily declining yet,",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","We’ve seen some evidence that core PCE inflation is perhaps either reaching a peak be a lot more information.",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","I just think we want to see that information as we get there.",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","It’s a very difficult environment to try to give forward guidance 60,",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","There are just so many things that can happen in the economy and around the world.",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","we’re leaving ourselves room to look at the data and make a decision as we get there.",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","I don’t think the one month is—no.",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","One month’s reading doesn’t tell us much.",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","we‘d want to see evidence that inflation is moving in a direction that gives us more comfort.",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","we’ve got two months now where core inflation is a little lower,",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","but we’re not looking at that as a reason to take some comfort.",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","I think we need to really see that our expectation is being fulfilled—that inflation,",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","is under control and starting to come down.",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","But, again, it’s not like we would stop.",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","We would just go back to 25-basis-point increases.",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","It’ll be a judgment call when these meetings arrive.",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","if we see what we expect to see,",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","then we would have 50-basis-point increases on the table at the next two meetings.",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","We don’t really see strong evidence of that yet,",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","but that does not in any way make us comfortable.",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","I think if you look at short-term inflation expectations, they’re quite elevated.",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","And you can look at that and say,",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","that’s because people expect inflation to come down.” And,",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","inflation expectations [at longer horizons] come down fairly sharply.",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","Longer-term inflation expectations have been reasonably stable but have moved up to—but only to levels where they were in 2014,",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","And I think that’s a fair description of the picture.",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","But it’s really about the risks.",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","We don’t see a wage–price spiral.",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","We see that companies have the ability to raise prices,",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","but there have been price shocks.",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","So I just think it takes you back to the basic point—was that we know we need to expeditiously move our policy rate up to ranges of more normal,",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","And we need to look around and keep going if we don’t see that financial conditions have tightened adequately or that the economy is behaving in ways that suggest that we’re not where we need to be.",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","you don’t see those things yet,",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","but I would say there’s no basis for feeling comfortable about that.",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","It’s a risk that we simply can’t run.",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","We can’t allow a wage–price spiral to happen.",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","And we can’t allow inflation expectations to become unanchored.",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","It’s just something that we can’t allow to happen,",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","and so we’ll look at it that way.",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","Okay, so in terms of the vacancies-to-unemployment ratio, we don’t have a goal in mind.",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","There’s no specific number that we’re saying,",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","“We’ve got to get to that.” matching functions in the labor markets are working.",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","the longer these expansions go on,",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","you can get very efficient with all of that,",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","and the Beveridge curve shifts out.",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","And that also tends to, you know, to help.",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","So there isn’t a specific number.",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","I think when we got to one-to-one in the,",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","we thought that was a pretty good number.",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","But, again, we’re not shooting for any particular number.",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","What we’d like to see is progress, but we’re not really looking at that.",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","We’re looking at wages, and we’re looking at, ultimately, inflation.",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","So, you know, there are a bunch of channels through which policy works.",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","and then you can think of another big one as asset values broadly.",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","a lot of different channels that are related to that.",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","we don’t focus on any one market—the equity market or the housing market—we focus on financial conditions broadly.",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","So we wouldn’t be targeting any one market,",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","for going up or down or taking a view on whether it’s at a good level or a bad level.",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","We just would be looking at very broad measures of financial conditions—all the different financial conditions indexes,",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","But they also include debt and other, many other things—credit spreads, things like that—too.",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","So, first, the first thing to say is that we understand.",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","And some of us are old enough to have lived through high inflation,",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","It’s just something people don’t—when they experience it for the first time,",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","you’re paying more for the same thing.",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","If you’re a normal economic person,",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","then you probably don’t have that much extra to spend.",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","And it’s immediately hitting your spending on groceries,",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","So we understand the pain involved.",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","So how do you get out of that?",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","And it’s our job to make sure that inflation of that unpleasant,",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","high nature doesn’t get entrenched in the economy.",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","one of the main things we’re here for—perhaps the most fundamental thing we’re here for.",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","we try to get supply and demand back in sync with each other,",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","so that the economy is under less stress and inflation will go down.",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","the process of getting there involves higher rates—so higher mortgage rates,",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","So it’s not going to be pleasant either.",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","But in the end, everyone is better off.",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","Everyone— particularly people on fixed incomes and at the lower part of the income distribution are better off with stable prices.",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","And so we need to do everything we can to restore stable prices.",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","We’ll do it as quickly and effectively as we can.",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","We think we have a good chance to do it without a significant increase in unemployment or,",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","we think about the medium and longer term,",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","and everyone will be better off if we can get this job done—the sooner,",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","So the economy is doing fairly well.",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","We expect growth to be solid this year.",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","household spending and business investment as fairly strong— and even in the first quarter,",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","which was relatively slow on some other fronts.",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","and the labor market—if you look at the labor market,",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","for people who are out of work and looking,",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","there are lots of job opportunities for—wages are moving up and at rates that haven’t been seen in quite a long time.",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","So it’s a good time to be a worker looking to,",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","either change jobs or get a wage increase in your current job.",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","and nothing about it suggests that it’s close to,",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","given events around the world and fading fiscal policy effects and higher rates,",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","you could see some slower economic activity.",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","it will not be—last year was an extraordinarily strong growth year as we recovered from the pandemic.",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","As I mentioned, growth [was] over 5 percent.",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","But most forecasters have growth this year at,",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","at a solid pace above 2 percent.",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","I think we have a good chance to restore price stability without a recession—without,",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","And I mentioned the reasons for that.",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","So I see a strong economy now.",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","I see a very strong labor market, for example.",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","Businesses can’t find the people to hire—they can’t people out of work.",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","The issue will come that we don’t have precision surgical tools.",""

"2022-05-04","Q&A","There are a range of opinions, though, and that’s only appropriate.",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","You know, it’s really the Fed that has responsibility for price stability.",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","And we take whatever arrives at the Fed in terms of fiscal activity,",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","and we don’t evaluate it—it’s not our job,",""

"2022-05-04","Q&A","you’ve recently spoken in great praise of Paul Volcker,",""

"2022-05-04","Q&A","I shouldn’t be singled out in this respect.",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","But I knew him just a little bit and have tremendous admiration for him.",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","And I— But I would phrase it this way:",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","He had the courage to do what he thought was the right thing.",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","It was that he always did—he always did—what he thought was the right thing.",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","If you read his last autobiography, that really comes through.",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","It isn’t, will we do one particular thing?",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","And so it’s really essential, particularly for the labor market.",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","like if you look at the last cycle,",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","very—longest expansion cycle in our recorded history.",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","you had the benefits of this tight labor market going to people in the lower quartiles.",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","but income gaps were coming down,",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","We’d all love to get back to that place.",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","But to get back to anything like that place, you need price stability.",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","So, basically, we’ve been hit by historically large inflationary shocks since the pandemic.",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","This isn’t anything like regular business.",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","we have the highest unemployment,",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","Then we have this outsized response from fiscal policy and monetary policy.",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","Then we have a war in Ukraine,",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","which is cutting the commodity,",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","And now we have these shutdowns in China.",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","So it’s been a series of inflationary shocks that are really different from anything people have seen in 40 years.",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","So we have to look through that and look at the economy that’s coming out the other side.",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","And we need to somehow find price stability out of this.",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","And it’s obviously going to be very challenging,",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","which are famously difficult to deal with.",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","So I guess that’s how I think about it.",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","So I didn’t—if I said “necessary,” I meant to say “appropriate.” We’re not going to be erecting a high barrier for this.",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","It’s more, if we think it’s appropriate.",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","You know, the point is, we’re a very long way from neutral now.",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","We’re moving there expeditiously, and we’ll continue to do so.",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","And we can’t make that decision, really, today.",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","The decision for about how high to go will be on the table to be made when we reach neutral.",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","And, you know, I expect we’ll get there expeditiously, as I’ve mentioned.",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","So it’s not that we don’t want to—making that decision today wouldn’t really mean anything.",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","if we do believe that it’s appropriate to go to those levels,",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","and that happened to be the date that we picked.",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","It was—nothing magic about it.",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","You know, it’s not going to have any macroeconomic significance over time.",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","Sometimes we publish these calendars on the first day of the month,",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","I wouldn’t read anything into it.",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","I would just stress how uncertain the effect balance sheet shrinkage compared to quantitative easing?",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","And, you know, these are very uncertain.",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","I really can’t be any clearer.",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","There won’t be any clearer [estimates].",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","on the path we’re on—and this will be taken,",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","too seriously—but sort of ¼ percent,",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","one rate increase over the course of a year at this pace.",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","But I would just say, with very wide uncertainty bands—very wide.",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","There are other estimates that are much smaller than that, by the way.",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","And some of you may read about that.",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","That’s kind of a mainstream estimate.",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","We know that it is part of returning to more normal, more neutral financial conditions.",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","our strategy is to set up a plan and have it operate and really have,",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","have the interest rate be the active tool of monetary policy.",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","In terms of speaking to the American people,",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","so I feel like sometimes I just want to remind us,",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","and that it’s inflation that people are feeling all over the country.",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","And it’s very important that they know that we know how painful it is and that we are working hard on fixing it.",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","I thought it was quite important to do that.",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","And so that was really the thinking behind that.",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","And a good example of why would be—in the fourth quarter of last year,",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","as we started talking about tapering sooner and then raising rates this year,",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","you saw financial markets reacting,",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","Not to bless any particular day’s measure,",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","but the way financial markets,",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","the forward rate curve has tightened in response to our guidance and our actions really amplifies our policy.",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","It’s—monetary policy is working through expectations now, to a very large extent.",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","We’ve only done two rate increases.",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","But if And that’s all through the economy.",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","People are feeling those higher rates already.",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","And so that shows that the markets think that our forward guidance is credible.",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","And I think we want to keep it that way.",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","you can see places where the demand is substantially in excess of supply.",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","And what you’re seeing as a result of that is prices going up and at unsustainable levels,",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","levels that are not consistent with 2 percent inflation.",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","And so what our tools do is that as we raise interest rates,",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","you know—businesses will invest a little bit less,",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","consumers will spend a little bit less.",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","getting supply and demand back,",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","is what gives us 2 percent inflation,",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","which is what gives the economy a footing where people can lead successful economic lives and not worry about inflation.",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","I mean, so, yes, there may be some pain associated with getting back to that.",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","the big pain over time is in not dealing with inflation and allowing it to become entrenched.",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","I think what you’ve seen is—really,",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","in the middle of last fall—there was a time when our policy stance was still pretty much in sync with what the data were saying.",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","If you remember, there were a couple of weak jobs reports.",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","inflation had come down till September,",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","And then around the end of October,",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","we got three or four really strong readings that just said,",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","this is a much stronger economy.",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","with the restatement of the jobs numbers,",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","it looked like the job market was much more even and stronger in the second half of the year.",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","we got an ECI reading—employment compensation,",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","[employment cost] index reading—the Friday before the November meeting.",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","Then we got a really strong jobs report.",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","Then we got a really high CPI report.",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","And so I think it became clear to the Committee that we needed to adjust and adapt.",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","Ever since then, really ever since then, we’ve been adapting.",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","you know—the Committee moved by the time of the December meeting to a median [in participants’ 2022 projections] of three rate increases,",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","then to a median of seven increases at the March meeting.",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","And that’s why I say—and I actually mentioned this at the March meeting—that no one should look at any single SEP as sort of a real resting place for 90 days,",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","because we’re in a fast-evolving situation.",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","You can see— unanimous vote today, of course.",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","And I told you the guidance—that broad support on the adapting to the data and to the situation and using our tools to deal with it.",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","So unemployment rates for all racial groups have come down a lot and are now much closer to where they were before the pandemic hit.",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","So that’s one thing I would say.",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","see the two sides of the mandate as in tension.",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","I don’t, because you can see that the labor market is out of balance.",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","You can see that there’s a labor shortage.",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","There aren’t enough people to fill these job openings.",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","and wages are moving up at levels that would not,",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","be consistent with 2 percent inflation over time.",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","And, of course, everyone loves to see wages go up.",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","but you want them to go up at a sustainable level,",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","to get the kind of labor market we really want to get,",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","we really want to have a labor market that serves all Americans,",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","especially the people in the lower-income part of the distribution,",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","To do that, you’ve got to have price stability.",""
"2022-05-04","Q&A","And we’ve got to get back to price stability so that we can have a labor market where people’s wages aren’t being eaten up by inflation and where we can have a long expansion,",""

"2022-06-15","Q&A","we’ve seen financial conditions tighten,",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","But the federal funds rate, even after this move, is at 1.6 percent.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","the Committee is moving rates up expeditiously to more normal levels,",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","and we came to the view that we’d like to do a little more front-end loading on that.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","So I think that the SEP gives you the levels that people think are appropriate at given points in time.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","This was really about the speed in which we would get there.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","75 basis points today—I said the next meeting could well be about a decision between 50 and 75.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","at the end of the July meeting,",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","in that range—in that more normal range,",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","and that’s a desirable place to be,",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","because you begin to have more optionality there about the speed with which you would proceed going forward.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","Just talking about the SEP for a second:",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","What it really says is that Committee participants widely would like to see policy at a modestly restricted—restrictive level at the end of this year.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","And that’s six months from now,",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","and so much data [can accrue] and so much can happen,",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","so remember how highly uncertain this is.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","But so that is generally a range of 3 to 3½ percent.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","and that’s what they want to see,",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","knowing what they know now and understanding that we need to be—we need to show resolve but also be flexible [in responding] to incoming data as we see it.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","we don’t need to do that much,",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","then we either do that much or possibly even more.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","But in any case, it will be very data dependent.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","Then you’re looking at next year,",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","people see more—a bit more tightening and a range of maybe 3½ to 4 percent.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","And that’s generally what meeting, and that’s what we did.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","So the question really is, how high does the rate really need to go?",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","And this is—the estimates on the Committee are in that range of 3½ to 4 percent.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","And how do you think about that?",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","you can think about the longer-run neutral rate,",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","and we think that’s in the mid-2s.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","You can look, frankly, at broader financial conditions.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","you can look at the effect they’re having on the economy,",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","credit spreads—all of those things go into that.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","You can also look at the yield curve and ask,",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","So for much of the yield curve now, real rates are positive.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","That’s not true at the short end.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","At the short end of the yield curve in the early years,",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","you don’t have real—you have negative rates still.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","ways—rigorous ways to think about it,",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","do we think financial conditions are in a place where they’re having the desired effect on the economy?",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","And that desired affect is, we’d like to see demand moderating.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","Demand is very hot still in the economy.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","We’d like to see the labor market getting better in balance between supply and demand,",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","and that can happen [as a result of developments coming] both from supply and demand.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","there’s—demand is substantially higher than available supply,",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","so we feel that there’s a role for us in moderating demand.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","Those are the things we can affect with our policy tools.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","There are many things we can’t affect,",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","the things—the commodity price issues that we’re having around the world due to the war in Ukraine and the fallout from that,",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","and also just all of the supply-side things that are still pushing upward on inflation.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","So that’s really how I think—how I think about it.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","I think it’s certainly in the range of plausible numbers.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","I think we’ll know when we get there really.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","that would be—you would have positive real rates,",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","and inflation coming down by then.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","I think you’d have positive real rates across the [yield] curve.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","I think that the neutral rate is pretty low these days.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","So I would think it would, but you know what?",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","We’re going to find that out empirically.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","We’re not going to be completely model driven about this.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","We’re going to be looking at this,",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","and reacting to incoming data both on financial conditions and on what’s happening in the economy.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","your policy to work through expectations.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","this decision was something quite different from how you and almost all of your colleagues had set those expectations during the intermeeting period.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","And I know you just said that what changed was really the inflation data—the inflation expectations data.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","on the inflation expectations data,",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","was there something you saw that was unsettling enough to risk eroding the credibility of your verbal guidance by doing something so different from what you had “socialized” before?",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","So if you look at a broad range of inflation expectations—so you’ve got the public,",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","you’ve got surveys of the public and of experts,",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","and you’ve also got market based.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","And I think if you look across that broad range of data,",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","what you see is that expectations are still in the place,",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","where short-term inflation is going to be high but comes down sharply over the next couple of years.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","And that’s really where inflation expectations are.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","as you get away from this episode,",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","they get back down close to 2 percent.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","And so this is really very important to us—that that remain the case.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","And I think if you look for most measures,",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","If we even see a couple of indicators that bring that into question,",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","We do not take this for granted—we take it very seriously.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","So the preliminary Michigan [survey] reading—it’s a preliminary reading;",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","We also noticed that the index of common inflation expectations at the Board has moved up after being pretty flat for a long time,",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","“this is something we need to take seriously.” And that is one of the factors,",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","as I mentioned—one of the factors in our deciding to move ahead with 75 basis points today was what we saw in inflation expectations.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","We’re going to—I’ll just say, we’re going to react to the incoming data and appropriately, I think.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","So I wouldn’t want to put a number on what that might be.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","The main thing is to get rates up,",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","we’ll be in an area where we’re—I think as you get closer to the end of the year,",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","you’re in a range where you’ve got restrictive policy,",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","Forty-year highs in inflation—we think that policy is going to need to be restrictive, and we don’t know how restrictive.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","So I think that’s how we’ll take it.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","To take your second question first, yes.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","we’re resolved to take this on,",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","but we’re going to be flexible in the implementation of it.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","Sorry—and your [first] question was [about] guidance.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","the overall exercise is that we try to be—provide as much clarity about our policy intentions as we can,",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","because we think that makes monetary policy work better.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","because you have to live with that guidance,",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","and it helps a lot of the time.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","I, significantly through the expectations channel, as we’ve made it clear what our plans are.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","So I think that’s been a very healthy thing to be happening.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","And I would hope that our—it’s always going to be—any guidance that we give is always going to be subject to things working out about as we expect.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","we’re looking for something specific,",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","and that is progress on inflation.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","We want to see—inflation can’t go down until it flattens out,",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","and that’s what we’re looking to see.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","then that’s the kind of thing that will—even if we don’t see progress for a longer period,",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","Soon enough, we will be seeing some progress at some point.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","And we’ll react [as] appropriate to that, too.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","that our guidance is still credible,",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","but it’s always going to be conditional on what happens.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","pretty close to—very close to our meeting.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","Very unusual to [have] one that would actually change the outcome.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","So I’ve only seen—in my 10-years-plus here at the Fed,",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","I’ve only seen something like that,",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","So I don’t think it’s something that’ll come up a great deal.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","what we want to see is a series of declining monthly readings for inflation,",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","and we’d like to see inflation headed down.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","But, you know—and right now, our policy rate is well below neutral, right?",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","we’ll have our policy rate— let’s assume the world works out about like the SEP says:",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","The policy rate will be up where we think it should be.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","And then the question would be: Do you slow down?",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","Does it make you— you’ll be making these judgments about,",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","is it appropriate now to slow down—from 50 to 25,",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","So that’s the kind of thinking we’ll be doing,",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","we’re not going to declare victory until we see a series of these,",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","that inflation is coming down.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","And that’s what I mean by—that’s what it would take for us to say,",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","we think this job is done.” Because we saw—and,",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","we saw last year—inflation came down over the course of the summer and then turned right around and went back up.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","So I think we’re going to be careful about declaring victory.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","the implementation of our policy is going to be flexible and sensitive to incoming data.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","I think that—I do think that our objective,",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","and this is what’s reflected in the SEP,",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","is to bring inflation down to 2 percent while the labor market remains strong.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","I think that what’s becoming more clear is that many factors that we don’t control are going to play a very significant role in deciding whether that’s possible or not.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","supply chain getting more challenging because of these external forces—and that path is to move demand down,",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","and you have a lot of surplus demand.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","Take, for example, in the labor market.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","So you have two job vacancies,",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","for every person actively seeking a job,",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","and that has led to a real imbalance in wage negotiating.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","You could get to a place where that ratio was at a more normal level,",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","and you wouldn’t—you would expect to see those wage pressures move back down to a level where people are still getting healthy wage increases,",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","but at a level that’s consistent with 2 percent inflation.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","And you could say the same thing about some of the product markets where there’s just excess capacity and really where the strong demand has gone into—sorry,",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","what we think of as a vertical supply curve or close to it.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","and it shows up in higher prices—not higher quantities,",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","because they can’t make the cars because they don’t have the semiconductors.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","So in principle, that could work in reverse.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","you could see—and it’s not guaranteed—but you could see prices coming down more than the typical economic relationships that you see in the textbooks would suggest,",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","because of the unusual situation we’re in on the supply side.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","it’s going to depend to some extent on factors we don’t control.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","we have unemployment going up to 4 point—the median is 4.1 percent—of course,",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","[there is] a range of actual forecasts.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","And I would characterize that,",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","if you were to get inflation down to,",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","on its way down to 2 percent and the unemployment rate went up to 4.1 percent,",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","that’s still a historically low level.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","We hadn’t seen—we hadn’t seen rates,",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","unemployment rates below 4 percent until a couple years ago for—we’d seen it for,",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","So the idea that—3.6 percent is historically low in the last century.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","So a 4.1 percent unemployment rate with inflation well on its way to 2 percent—I think that would be—I think that would be a successful outcome.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","So we’re not looking to have a higher unemployment rate.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","But I would say that I would certainly look at that as a successful outcome.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","We’re not—again, we’re not, we don’t seek to put people out of work, of course.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","and fewer people need to have jobs.” But we also think that you really cannot have the kind of labor market we want without price stability.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","And we have to go back and establish price stability so we can have that kind of labor market,",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","and that’s a labor market where workers are getting wage increases—maybe the workers at the lower end of the spectrum are getting the biggest wage increases,",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","as they were before the pandemic—where participation is high,",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","where there’s lots of job opportunities,",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","where it’s just a really—I mean,",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","the labor market we had before the pandemic was—that’s what we want to get back to.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","And you see disparities between various groups at historic lows.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","We’d love to get back to that place.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","But, to get there—it’s not going to happen with the levels of inflation",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","Not trying to induce a recession now.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","We’re trying to achieve 2 percent inflation consistent with a strong labor market.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","That’s what we’re trying to do.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","So let me talk about that sentence.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","it’s our goal to bring about 2 percent inflation while keeping the labor market strong,",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","And that’s kind of what the SEP says.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","The SEP has inflation getting down to 2,",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","a little above 2 percent in 2024,",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","with unemployment at 4.1 percent.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","And this is a strong labor market—this is a good labor market.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","And, as I mentioned, there are pathways to do it.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","But those pathways have become much more challenging due to factors that are not under our control.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","thinking here of the fallout from the war in Ukraine,",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","which has brought a spike in prices of energy,",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","and also just the supply chains more broadly,",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","which have been larger and longer lasting than anticipated.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","So the sentence that we deleted said that we believe that appropriate monetary policy,",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","can bring about the result of 2 percent inflation with a strong labor market.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","And so much of it is really not down to monetary policy.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","Well, yeah, I think you’ve seen—again, we’ve been expecting progress, and we didn’t get that.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","So I also think the situation,",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","really—since the consequences of the Ukraine war become more and more clear,",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","what you’re seeing is the situation getting more difficult.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","And you look around the world—I mean,",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","lots of countries are—lots of countries are looking at inflation of 10 percent,",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","and it’s largely due to commodities prices.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","But all over the world, you’re seeing these effects.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","And so—and we’re seeing them here: gas prices at all-time highs, and things like that.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","That’s not something we can do something about.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","So that is really—and, by the way, headline inflation, headline inflation is important for expectations.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","People—the public’s expectations, why would they be distinguishing between core inflation and headline inflation?",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","Core inflation is something we [on the Committee] think about because it is a better predictor of future inflation.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","But headline inflation is what people experience.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","So that’s—expectations are very much at risk due to high headline inflation.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","So it’s become—the environment has become more difficult,",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","in the last four or five months,",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","and hence the need for the policy actions that we took today.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","Hence our resolution to get rates up and,",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","get them to where we think they need to be in coming months.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","market by falling and then revisions to the previous months were down.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","Are you hearing from contacts about consumers slowing spending or changing their habits?",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","very carefully for that and looking at the retail—the big store numbers and all that kind of thing.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","And so I—but I think the fair summary of what we see is,",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","you see continuing shifts in consumption,",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","you see some things getting—sales going down,",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","but overall spending is very strong.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","The consumer’s in really good shape financially.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","There’s no sign of a broader slowdown that I can see in the economy.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","People are talking about it a lot—consumer confidence is very low.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","That’s probably related to gas prices and also just stock prices to some extent for other people.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","We’re not seeing a broad slowdown.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","We see job growth slowing, but it’s still at quite robust levels.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","We see the economy slowing a bit but still growth levels—healthy growth levels.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","It would be hard to watch anything much more closely than we watch consumer spending, but we watch everything.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","We watch business fixed investment, which actually has softened a bit.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","And we watch—we’re responsible for watching everything.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","Consumption is 60-some percent of the economy, two-thirds of the economy, so, naturally, we spend a lot of time on that.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","And, again, there’s a lot going on—there are a lot of flows back and",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","So the—we’re responsible for inflation in the law.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","And inflation means headline inflation.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","very carefully at core inflation because it is—it’s a much better predictor,",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","and it’s much—it’s a much better predictor of where inflation is going,",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","and it’s also more relevant to our tools.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","the parts that don’t go into core are mostly outside the scope of our tools,",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","But it’s—the current situation is particularly difficult because of what I mentioned about expectations.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","We can’t affect, really—I mean, the energy prices are set by global commodity prices.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","And most of food—not all of it,",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","but most food prices are pretty heavily influenced by global commodity prices,",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","So we can’t really have much of an effect.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","But we have to be mindful of the potential effect on inflation expectations [coming] from headline [inflation readings].",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","So it’s a very difficult situation to be in,",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","we can’t do much about the difference between [headline and core inflation rates due to] the elements that make up headline that are not in core.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","It reflects all of the economic readings.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","It also reflects the 75 basis point increase.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","So people had that in hand when they—when their SEPs were submitted.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","So it’s—in other words, it’s not in addition to what’s in the",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","So I think the role that we can play—maybe the way to get at this is to say that the role that we can play is around demand,",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","And we’ll be able to see—the areas that we can affect are those associated with excess demand,",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","and we’ll be able to see our effect on,",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","And that would tell us what’s—that would tell us about wages.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","Wages are not principally responsible for the inflation that we’re seeing,",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","particularly in the service sector.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","Sorry, I’m not sure I’m getting to your question.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","There’s always a risk of going too far or going not far enough,",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","and it’s going to be a very difficult judgment to make,",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","or maybe not—maybe it’ll be really clear.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","But we’re—and we’re quite mindful of the dangers.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","the worst mistake we could make would be to fail,",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","We have to restore price stability.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","We really do, because everything—it’s the bedrock of the economy.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","If you don’t have price stability,",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","the economy’s really not going to work the way it’s supposed to.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","It won’t work for people—their wages will be eaten up.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","So we want to get the job done.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","This inflation happened relatively recently.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","We don’t think that it’s affecting expectations in any kind of fundamental way.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","We don’t think that we’re seeing a wage–price spiral.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","We think that the public generally sees us as very likely to be successful in getting inflation down to 2 percent,",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","It’s absolutely key to the whole thing that we sustain that confidence.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","So that’s how we’re thinking about it.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","So, clearly, people don’t like inflation—a lot.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","And many people are experiencing it,",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","because we haven’t had anything like this kind of inflation in 40 years.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","And it’s really something people don’t like.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","And they’re experiencing that, determined to do what we can to get inflation back down.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","So that’s really what we’re saying.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","We’re not—I’m not—clearly, it’s an incredibly unpopular thing, and it’s very painful for people.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","the really critical question from the perspective of doing our job is making sure that the public does have confidence that we have the tools and will use them and they do work to bring inflation back down over time.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","inflation has started—it started off in quite narrow,",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","and it’s spread now broadly across the economy and into the services sector as well.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","It was really in the goods sector at the beginning.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","if you’ve flown on a plane lately—planes are very full,",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","and plane tickets are very expensive.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","Some of that will be pass- through of energy prices,",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","but it’s—so you’re experiencing services inflation.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","So the question—and then you see the Cleveland measure going up,",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","and many other measures are going up.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","So it’s a time when we’re not seeing progress and we want to see be,",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","in the thinking of the Committee,",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","somewhere in the range of 3 to 3½ percent by year-end.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","And then after that, you see what the rest of the SEP says.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","So I hope that’s responsive to your question.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","So I think what’s in the SEP would certainly meet that test.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","If you see—you’re looking at getting back down to almost a 2 percent inflation by 2024,",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","and the unemployment rate is still as low as 4.1 percent.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","That would be—I would call that as meeting that test.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","Do I still think that we can do that?",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","I think there’s—I think there’s—I don’t want to be the handicapper here.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","I just—that is our objective, and I do think it’s possible.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","I think that events of the last few months have raised the degree of difficulty,",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","can we still do it—there’s a much bigger chance now that it’ll depend on factors that we don’t control,",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","fluctuations and spikes in commodity prices could wind up taking that option out of our hands.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","very focused on getting inflation back down to 2 percent,",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","which we think is essential for the benefit of the public and also to put us on a path back to a sustainably strong labor market like the one we had before the pandemic.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","financial conditions have tightened over the last seven months,",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","But the federal funds rate, even after this increase, is at 1.6 percent.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","So it’s hard to see how that is too high of a rate.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","And even if we did another—so we’re going to get here by the end of the summer,",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","Still, that’s still a low rate.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","So that’s not a rate that is calculated to bring a recession on.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","And we’ll—by then, we’ll have seen a whole lot more data.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","As I mentioned a couple times,",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","the Committee’s views are around a modestly restrictive stance,",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","which will be in the 3 to 3½ percent range by the end of this year,",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","but that’s conditioned on that being the appropriate thing to do.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","If we see data going in a different direction,",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","it’ll be reflected in our policy,",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","We’ll be watching—if things go in a direction we don’t expect,",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","And I would say, this is a highly uncertain environment—extraordinarily uncertain environment.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","So, again, we’ll be determined and resolved, but flexible.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","we’ve been looking very carefully and hard at why inflation picked up so much more than expected last year and why it proved so persistent.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","We— it’s hard to overstate the extent of interest we have in that question morning,",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","But you have to understand the context.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","For decades before the pandemic and the reopening,",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","you had a world where inflation was dominated by disinflationary forces such as declining population or aging demographics,",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","So and that’s how all the models work is,",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","decades and decades of data—they look at that.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","It’s a very flat Philips curve world,",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","and the supply shocks tend to be transient,",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","So we have now experienced an extraordinary series of shocks,",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","followed by the war in Ukraine,",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","followed by shutdowns in China—the war in Ukraine potentially having effects for years here.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","So we’re aware that a different set of forces are driving the economy—we have been,",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","But this is a different—these forces are different.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","it really is a question of very strong demand.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","But you couldn’t get this kind of inflation without a change on the supply side,",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","which is there for anybody to see,",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","which is these blockages and shortages and people dropping out of the labor force and things like that.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","So that’s how we’re looking at it.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","And we’ve done a lot of work internally on,",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","you don’t know whether those forces are—to what extent are they going to be sustained?",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","will we go back to a world where it looks a little more like the and sort of there’s a “new normal,” and things settle down.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","But, honestly, we don’t know what that’s going to be.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","we have to find price stability in this new world and maximum employment in this new world where,",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","inflationary forces are—you’re seeing them everywhere.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","Again, if you look around the world at where inflation levels are, it’s absolutely extraordinary.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","we’re sort of in the middle of the pack,",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","a different kind of inflation than other people have,",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","partly because our economy is stronger and more highly recovered.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","We’ve done a lot of introspection and work on that and—sorry,",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","we’ve communicated really clearly to the markets about what we’re going to do there.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","Markets seem to be okay with it.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","We’re phasing in—Treasury [security] issuance is down quite a lot,",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","quite a lot from where it’s been,",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","so I have no reason to think—markets are forward looking,",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","I have no reason to think it will lead to illiquidity and problems.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","It seems to be kind of understood and accepted at this point.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","So rates were very low—a good place to start is that rates were very,",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","very low for quite a while because of the pandemic and the need to do everything we could more normal,",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","while rates were low and while demand was really high,",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","obviously demand for housing changed from wanting to live in urban areas to some extent to living in single-family homes in the suburbs,",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","And so the demand was just suddenly much higher.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","And we saw prices moving up very, very strongly for the last couple of years.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","and rates have moved up—we’re well aware that mortgage rates have moved up a lot—and you’re seeing a changing housing market.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","We’re watching it to see what will happen.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","How much will it really affect residential investment?",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","How much will it affect housing prices?",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","It’s—I mean, obviously, we’re watching that quite carefully.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","You would think over time—I mean,",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","so there’s a tremendous amount of supply in the housing market of unfinished homes,",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","and as those come on line—whereas the supply of finished homes,",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","inventory of finished homes that are for sale,",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","So it’s still a very tight market.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","So prices may keep going up for a while even in a world where rates are up.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","So it’s a complicated situation.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","I would say if you’re a homebuyer,",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","somebody or a young person looking to buy a home,",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","We need to get back to a place where supply and demand are back together and where inflation is down low again and mortgage rates are low again.",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","So this will be a process whereby we—ideally,",""
"2022-06-15","Q&A","we do our work in a way that the housing market settles in a new place and housing availability and credit availability are at appropriate levels.",""
"2022-07-27","Opening Statement","My colleagues and I are strongly committed to bringing inflation back down,",""
"2022-07-27","Opening Statement","and we’re moving expeditiously to do so.",""
"2022-07-27","Opening Statement","We have both the tools we need and the resolve it will take to restore price stability on behalf of American families and businesses.",""
"2022-07-27","Opening Statement","The economy and the country have been through a lot over the past two and a half years and have proved resilient.",""
"2022-07-27","Opening Statement","It is essential that we bring inflation down to our 2 percent goal if we are to have a sustained period of strong labor market conditions that benefit all.",""
"2022-07-27","Opening Statement","From the standpoint of our congressional mandate to promote maximum employment and price stability,",""
"2022-07-27","Opening Statement","the current picture is plain to see:",""
"2022-07-27","Opening Statement","The labor market is extremely tight,",""
"2022-07-27","Opening Statement","and inflation is much too high.",""
"2022-07-27","Opening Statement","today the FOMC raised its policy interest rate by ¾ of a percentage point and anticipates that ongoing increases in the target range for the federal funds rate will be appropriate.",""
"2022-07-27","Opening Statement","we are continuing the process of significantly reducing the size of our balance sheet.",""
"2022-07-27","Opening Statement","And I’ll have more to say about today’s monetary policy actions after briefly reviewing economic developments.",""

"2022-07-27","Opening Statement","Growth in consumer spending has slowed significantly,",""

"2022-07-27","Opening Statement","Activity in the housing sector has weakened, in part reflecting higher mortgage rates.",""

"2022-07-27","Opening Statement","We anticipate that ongoing increases in the target range for the federal funds rate will be appropriate;",""

"2022-07-27","Opening Statement","We will continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting and communicating—and communicate our thinking as clearly as possible.",""
"2022-07-27","Opening Statement","As the stance of monetary policy tightens further,",""
"2022-07-27","Opening Statement","it likely will become appropriate to slow the pace of increases while we assess how our cumulative policy adjustments are affecting the economy and inflation.",""
"2022-07-27","Opening Statement","Our overarching focus is using our tools to bring demand into better balance with supply in order to bring inflation back down to our 2 percent goal and to keep longer-term inflation expectations well anchored.",""

"2022-07-27","Opening Statement","Inflation has obviously surprised to the upside over the past year,",""
"2022-07-27","Opening Statement","and further surprises could be in store.",""
"2022-07-27","Opening Statement","We therefore will need to be nimble in responding to incoming data and the evolving outlook.",""

"2022-07-27","Opening Statement","We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum-employment and price-stability goals.",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","So we did judge that a 75 basis point increase was the right magnitude in light of the data and in the context of the ongoing increases in the policy rate that we’ve been making.",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","I’d say that we wouldn’t hesitate to,",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","to make an even larger move than we did today if the Committee were to conclude that that was—that that were appropriate.",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","That was not the case at this meeting.",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","There was very broad support for the move that we made.",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","You mentioned the—the June meeting.",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","we had said many times that we were prepared to move aggressively,",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","if inflation continued to disappoint.",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","And that’s why we did move to a more aggressive pace at the June meeting,",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","So I guess I’d start by saying we’ve been saying we would move expeditiously to get to the range of neutral.",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","And I think we’ve done that now.",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","We’re at—we’re at 2.25 to 2.5 [percent],",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","and that’s right in the range of what we think is neutral.",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","So the question is, how are we thinking about the path forward?",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","So one thing that hasn’t changed is that—won’t change—is that our focus is continuing to—is going to continue to be on using our tools to bring demand back into better balance with supply in order to bring inflation back down.",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","That’ll continue to be our overarching focus.",""

"2022-07-27","Q&A","we’ll be looking at the incoming data,",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","and that’ll start with economic activity.",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","Are we seeing the slowdown that we—the slowdown in economic activity—that we think we need?",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","And there’s some evidence that we are at this time.",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","we’ll be looking at labor market Of course,",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","we’ll be looking closely at inflation.",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","You mentioned headline and core.",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","Our mandate is for headline, of course; it’s not for core.",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","But we look at core because core is,",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","is actually a better indicator of headline and of all inflation going forward.",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","So we’ll be—we’ll be looking at both.",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","And we’ll be looking at them for—at those both,",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","really—for what they’re saying about the outlook rather than just simply for,",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","But we’ll be asking: Do we see inflationary pressures declining?",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","Do we see actual readings of inflation coming down?",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","the question we’ll be asking is whether the stance of policy we have is sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation back down to our 2 percent target.",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","And it’s also worth noting that these rate hikes have been large,",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","and they’ve come—they’ve come quickly.",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","And it’s likely that their full effect has not been felt by the economy.",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","So there’s probably some additional tightening, significant additional tightening, in the pipeline.",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","So where are we going with this?",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","I think the best—I think the Committee broadly feels that we need to get policy to at least to a moderately restrictive level.",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","And maybe the best data point for that would be what we wrote down in our SEP at the—at the June meeting.",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","So I think the median [federal funds rate] for the end of this year,",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","the median would’ve been between 3¼ and 3½ [percent].",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","And, then, people wrote down 50 basis points higher than that for 2023.",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","So that’s—even though that’s now six weeks old, I guess, that’s—that’s the most recent reading.",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","Of course, we’ll update that reading at the—at the September meeting in eight weeks.",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","So that’s how we’re thinking about it.",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","I said that another unusually large increase could be appropriate,",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","but that’s not a decision we’re making now.",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","It’s one that we’ll make based kind of clear guidance that we had provided on the way to neutral.",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","So I’m going to start by pointing out that it’s very hard to say with any confidence in normal times—in normal times—what the economy’s going to be doing in 6 or 12 months.",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","And to try to predict what the appropriate monetary policy would respond— response would be—of course,",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","you’ve got to take any estimates of what rates will be next year with a grain of salt,",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","because there’s so much uncertainty.",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","There’s significantly more uncertainty now about the path ahead than I think there ordinarily is,",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","the only data point I have for you really is the June SEP,",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","which I think is just the most recent thing that the Committee’s done.",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","Since then, inflation has come in higher; economic activity has come in weaker than expected.",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","end of this year—by which I mean somewhere between 3 and 3½ percent—and that when the Committee sees further rate increases in 2023,",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","But that’s really the best I can do on that.",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","So I wouldn’t say it was—I think we didn’t expect a good reading,",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","but this one—this one was even worse than expected,",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","I don’t talk about my own personal estimate of,",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","of what the terminal rate would be.",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","I do—I will write down that in—it’s going to evolve.",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","it has evolved over the course—I think,",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","it has evolved over the course of the year as we learn how persistent inflation’s going to be.",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","And by the time of the September meeting,",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","we will have seen two more CPI readings and two more labor market readings and a significant amount of readings about economic activity and perhaps geopolitical developments,",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","It’s an eight-week intermeeting period, so I think we’ll see quite a lot of data.",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","And we’ll make our decision at that meeting based on that data.",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","So we’re going to be—again, we’re going to be focused on getting inflation back down.",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","And we—as I’ve said on other occasions,",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","price stability is really the bedrock of the economy.",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","And nothing works in the economy without price stability.",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","We can’t have a strong labor market without price stability for an extended period of time.",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","We all want to get back to the kind of labor market we had before the pandemic,",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","racial and gender differences and that kind of thing were at historic minimums,",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","We want to get back to that, but that’s not happening.",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","That’s not going to happen without, without restoring price stability.",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","So that’s something we see as, as something that we simply must do.",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","And we think that in the—we don’t see it as a tradeoff with,",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","We see it as a way to facilitate the sustained achievement of the employment mandate in the longer term.",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","So we’re trying to do just the right amount, right?",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","We’re not—we’re not trying to have a recession.",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","And we don’t think we have to.",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","We think that there’s a path for us to be able to bring inflation down while sustaining a strong labor market,",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","some softening in labor market conditions.",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","So that is— that’s what we’re trying to achieve,",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","and we continue to think that there’s a path to that.",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","really based on events that are outside of our control.",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","I do think—as I said just now—that restoring price stability is just something that we have to do.",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","there isn’t an option to fail to do that because that is the thing that enables you to have a strong labor market over time.",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","over the medium and longer term,",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","to actually have a strong—a sustained period of very strong labor market conditions.",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","we serve both sides of the dual mandate,",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","but we actually see them as well aligned on this.",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","We’re trying not to make a mistake.",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","Let me put it this way: We do see that there are two-sided risks.",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","There would be the risk of doing too much and,",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","imposing more of a downturn on the economy than,",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","but the risk—the risk of doing too little and leaving the economy with this entrenched inflation,",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","If They start to factor high inflation into their decisions—when that—on a sustained basis.",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","When that starts to really happen,",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","and we don’t think that’s happened yet,",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","but when that starts to happen,",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","it just gets that much harder.",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","And the pain will be that much greater.",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","So I really do think that it’s important that we—that we address this now and get it done.",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","Ah, haven’t seen it, and, and we’ll just have to see what it says.",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","I don’t—I mean, I would say, generally, the GDP numbers do have a tendency to be revised pretty significantly.",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","It’s just—it’s just that it’s very hard—it’s very hard to cumulate [to an estimate of]",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","So those are—those are the toughest rules in place,",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","at any comparable institution that I’m aware of.",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","We think—you know, we’ve thought about this carefully, and we put them in place.",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","And we’re building the infrastructure so that—so that,",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","the enforcement will be tight,",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","you won’t be able to make trades unless they’re precleared.",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","And the amount of trades you make,",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","they’ll have to be 45 days or more before any FOMC meeting.",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","It’s just—I think we’ve really,",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","created a very strong and robust set of rules that will,",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","support public trust in the institution.",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","And, again, we’re just now—the system is just now up and running.",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","wanted to ask a little bit more about the 75 basis points versus 50 versus 25.",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","Can you talk a little bit about what,",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","what kind of goes into your thinking for,",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","making the decision on how much to raise rates and,",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","just talking about a very large amount that you alluded to?",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","Could that possibly be 100 basis points?",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","is there any sort of weakness in the economy,",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","that would lead you to slow your hiking pace?",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","So I’m going to—I’m going to take that as a question about the next meeting and thereafter.",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","we’re going to be looking at all of those things:",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","And we’re going to be thinking about our policy stance and where does it really need to be.",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","as this process—now that we’re at neutral—as the process goes on,",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","And we haven’t made a decision when that point is,",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","but intuitively that makes sense,",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","We’ve been front-end-loading these very large rate increases,",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","and now we’re getting closer to where we need to be.",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","So that’s how we’re thinking about it.",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","we’re going—we’re going to watch the data and the evolving outlook very carefully and factor in everything and make a decision in September about what to do.",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","And I’m not really going to provide any specific guidance about what that might be.",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","So, you know, but I mentioned that we might do another unusually large rate increase.",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","But that’s not a decision that we’ve made at all.",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","So we are—you know, we’re going to be guided by the data.",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","And I think you can still think of the,",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","the destination as broadly in line with the September—sorry,",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","because Committee thinks it needs to get at the end of the year and then into next year.",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","So it’s an interesting, interesting situation.",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","Of course, we’ve, we’ve long used PCE because we think it’s just better at capturing the inflation that people actually face in their lives.",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","And I think that that view is pretty widely understood.",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","That said, the public really reads about",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","just talking about demand for a second:",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","I think you pretty clearly do see a slowing now in demand in the second quarter— consumer spending,",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","people widely looked at the first-quarter numbers and thought they didn’t make sense and might have been misleading in terms of the overall direction of the economy—[that was] not,",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","not true of the second quarter.",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","But at the same time, you have this labor market.",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","So there are plenty of experiences where GDP has been reported as weak and the labor market as strong.",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","And the economy has gone right through that and been fine.",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","So that—that’s happened many times.",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","And it used to happen—if you remember,",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","in the first quarter of every year,",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","and the labor market was moving on just The truth is,",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","we think that demand is moderating.",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","We’re going to have to watch the data carefully.",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","There are—there is a great deal of money on people’s balance sheets that they can spend.",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","The unemployment rate is very low.",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","There are many, many job openings.",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","So it’s the kind of thing where you think that the—that the economy should actually be,",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","be doing pretty well in the second half of the year.",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","We don’t know that because you do see a marked slowing in the second quarter that does—that is fairly broad.",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","we do want to see demand running below potential for a sustained period to create slack and,",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","and give inflation a chance to come down.",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","So I think you’re already seeing—you’ve seen,",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","what you’ve seen is a decline from very high levels of job creation last year and earlier this year to modestly slower job creation—still,",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","You’re seeing some increase—some increase in initial claims from insurance,",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","although that may actually have to do with seasonal adjustments.",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","We’re not sure that that’s actually real.",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","employment compensation index measurement, I think, on Friday, I guess.",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","And that’s a very important one because it adjusts for compensation—composition.",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","you hear much—the sort of level of concern on the part of businesses that they simply can’t find workers is probably down a little bit from what it was,",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","late in the latter parts of last year.",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","So there’s a feeling that the labor market is moving back into balance.",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","If you look at—if you look at job openings or quits,",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","you see them moving sideways or perhaps a little bit down.",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","But it’s only the beginning of an adjustment.",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","once you start citing these things,",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","If you look at the household survey,",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","you see much lower job creation,",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","and the household survey can be quite volatile,",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","but it has no jobs created in the last three months.",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","So that might be a signal that job creation’s actually a little bit slower than we’re seeing in the—in the establishment survey.",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","I would say there’s some evidence that labor demand may be slowing a bit—labor supply,",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","We have been disappointed that labor force participation really hasn’t moved up since January.",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","That may be related to yet another big wave of",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","So I think we’re looking—we’re going to be looking at, at inflation as well.",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","You know, as I mentioned, we need to see inflation coming down.",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","that the labor market can adjust because of the huge overhang of job openings,",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","There should be able to be an adjustment that would have lower than—perhaps lower-than-expected increases in unemployment—lower than would be expected in the ordinary course of events because the level—the ratio of,",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","of vacancies to unemployed is just out of keeping with historical experience.",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","And that suggests that this time could be different.",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","So as, as I mentioned, it doesn’t seem that the",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","So we think it’s working fine.",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","As you know, we, we tapered up into it.",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","And, and in September, we’ll go to full strength.",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","And the markets seem to have accepted it.",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","By all assessments, the markets should be able to absorb this.",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","And we expect that’ll be the case.",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","So I guess your second question was getting—the process of getting back down to the new equilibrium will take a while.",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","the model would suggest that it could be between two,",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","And this is a much faster pace than the last time.",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","Balance sheet’s much, much bigger than it was.",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","But we looked at this carefully,",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","And we have no reason to think it’s not.",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","So a big piece of that is inflation expectations—you know,",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","It’s a good thing that markets do seem to have confidence in,",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","in the Committee’s commitment to getting inflation back down to 2 percent.",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","So we like to see market-based, you know, readings of inflation expectations come down.",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","You know, broader financial conditions have tightened, tightened a good bit.",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","and then financial conditions are what affects the economy.",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","And we don’t control that second step.",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","We’re just going to do what we think needs to be done.",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","We’re going to—we’re going to get our policy rate to a level where we’re confident that and that they’re having the effect that we would hope they’re having,",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","which is to see demand moderate and inflationary pressures recede and,",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","we said that we wouldn’t lift off until we had basically achieved our dual-mandate goals.",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","And the reason we did it in real time was that,",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","the first look at the new framework that we’d rolled out,",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","You’ll never get inflation to 2 percent.” Some of our critics now who say inflation’s too tight—too high were the same ones who were saying,",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","“You’ll never get to 2 percent.” Well,",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","So we, we thought we needed to really make a strong statement with that.",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","It wasn’t part of the framework.",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","The December ’20 guidance was not part of our overall new framework.",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","It was just guidance that we put in place.",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","One, I don’t think that that has materially changed the situation.",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","But I have to admit, I don’t think I would do that again.",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","I don’t think I would do that again.",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","the situation evolved in a highly But did it matter in the end?",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","You know, we—if you look at—I really don’t think it did.",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","I’m not sure it would’ve mattered if we’d been raising rates three months earlier.",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","Does anybody think that would’ve made a big difference?",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","lots of central banks were raising rates three months earlier,",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","this is a—this is a global phenomenon that’s happening now—admittedly,",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","different in the United States,",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","So I think we learned—there’ve been multiple taper tantrums, right?",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","So there was the famous one in 2013.",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","There’s what happened at the December ’18 meeting,",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","markets can ignore developments around the balance sheet for years on end and then suddenly react very sharply.",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","So we just had developed a practice of moving predictably and doing it in steps and things like that.",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","It was just like that’s how we did it.",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","And so we did it that way this time.",""

"2022-07-27","Q&A","Yes, we were trying to avoid a tantrum because they can be quite destructive.",""

"2022-07-27","Q&A","that people would go back to work,",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","that labor force participation would come back,",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","and labor force participation would jump back up.",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","That’s what we were—that was very broadly thought to be the case:",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","these supply-side issues would get solved reasonably quickly.",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","So that’s really the learning,",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","is around how complicated these supply-side issues can be.",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","We haven’t seen this before in a long, long time.",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","what accounts for the pace at which we moved,",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","When inflation changed direction, really, in October, we’ve moved quickly since then.",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","But before then, inflation was coming down month by month.",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","And, you know, we kind of thought we had the story—probably had the story right.",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","you started to see a range of data that said “No.",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","This is a much stronger economy and much higher inflation than we’ve been thinking.” And,",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","a lot of economists think that the—that the natural rate of unemployment will have moved up to some significant extent above where we think it was before.",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","And the reason is there’s—it’s the usual matching issue,",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","where matching has become less effective,",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","and that kind of thing when you have the kind of turbulent downturn and don’t know it.",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","We can never know where these star variables are in real time with any confidence.",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","But I would say it must have moved up materially.",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","But the other side of that is,",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","as all these jobs get created and people go back to work and unemployment is so low,",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","you could see it coming back down pretty significantly.",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","take pressure off of inflation because it’s that gap—it’s the gap between actual unemployment and the—and the natural rate that really is relevant for,",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","the negative slack we have in the economy with the overtight labor market.",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","So if you were to—you wouldn’t observe this.",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","but you could actually be seeing inflationary pressures coming down if that does happen.",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","And we don’t—we don’t control that.",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","if the pandemic and the disorder in the labor market caused the natural rate to move up,",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","then as the labor market settles down,",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","you should see it move back down.",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","No, all I’ve really said is I don’t think it’s likely that the",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","there are precedents for the FOMC moving very quickly— for example,",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","So we’ve been known to do that when it’s the appropriate thing to do.",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","given how quickly we’ve moved,",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","There’s been some volatility, but that’s only to be expected.",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","they’re—that they’re vulnerable to a fall, actually.",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","Many asset values have come down.",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","I think you’ve got a well-capitalized banking system.",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","I think you have—households are generally in about as strong as financial shape as they’ve been in a very long time or perhaps ever given the money that’s on people’s balance sheets.",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","So you have a pretty—from a financial stability standpoint, you have a pretty decent picture.",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","there are plenty of macroeconomic issues that don’t rise to the level of financial stability concerns.",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","we think of that as things that might undermine the working of the financial system,",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","That’s not to say that people at the lower end of the income spectrum aren’t,",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","They’re suffering from high inflation.",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","They’re going to the—to the grocery store and finding that,",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","their paycheck doesn’t cover the food they’re accustomed to buying.",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","We’re seeing actual, you know, real declines in food consumption.",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","And, you know, it’s very concerning.",""
"2022-07-27","Q&A","And that’s why we’re—we’re really committed to bringing down inflation—one of the reasons.",""
"2022-09-21","Opening Statement","My colleagues and I are strongly committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal.",""
"2022-09-21","Opening Statement","We have both the tools we need and the resolve that it will take to restore price stability on behalf of American families and businesses.",""
"2022-09-21","Opening Statement","Price stability is the responsibility of the Federal Reserve and serves as the bedrock of our economy.",""
"2022-09-21","Opening Statement","Without price stability, the economy does not work for anyone.",""
"2022-09-21","Opening Statement","we will not achieve a sustained period of strong labor market conditions that benefit all.",""
"2022-09-21","Opening Statement","Today the FOMC raised its policy interest rate by ¾ percentage point,",""
"2022-09-21","Opening Statement","and we anticipate that ongoing increases will be appropriate.",""
"2022-09-21","Opening Statement","We are moving our policy stance purposefully to a level that will be sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2 percent.",""
"2022-09-21","Opening Statement","we are continuing the process of significantly reducing the size of our balance sheet.",""
"2022-09-21","Opening Statement","I will have more to say about today’s monetary policy actions after briefly reviewing economic developments.",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","So I will answer—I will answer your question directly,",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","but I want to start here today by saying that my main message has not changed at all since Jackson Hole.",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","The FOMC is strongly resolved to bring inflation down to 2 percent,",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","and we will keep at it until the job is done.",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","So the way we’re thinking about this is,",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","the overarching focus of the Committee is getting inflation back down to 2 percent.",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","we think we’ll need to do two things,",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","to achieve a period of growth below trend;",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","and also some softening in labor market conditions to foster a better balance between demand and supply in the labor market.",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","the Committee’s forecasts and those of most outside forecasters do show growth running below its longer-run potential this year and next year.",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","so far there’s only modest evidence that the labor market is cooling off.",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","quits are off their all-time highs;",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","there’s some signs that some wage measures may be flattening out but not moving up;",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","payroll gains have moderated but not much.",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","And in light of the high inflation we’re seeing,",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","we think we’ll need to—and in light of what I just said,",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","we think that we’ll need to bring our funds rate to a restrictive level and to keep it there for some time.",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","So, what will we be looking at, I guess, is your question.",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","So we’ll be looking at a few things.",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","we’ll want to see growth continuing to run below trend,",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","we’ll want to see movements in the labor market showing a return to a better balance between supply and demand,",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","we’ll want to see clear evidence that inflation is moving back down to 2 percent.",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","So that’s what we’ll be looking for.",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","I think we’d want to be very confident that inflation is moving back down to 2 percent before we would consider that.",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","about how you factor in the variable lags on inflation and the extent to which the outlook for rates should be seen as linear in the sense that you keep raising rates?",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","can you envision a time when there’s a pause to kind of look at what has been wrought in the economy from the rate increases?",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","So, of course, monetary policy does, famously, work with long and variable lags.",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","The way I think of it is, our policy decisions affect financial conditions immediately.",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","In fact, financial conditions have usually been affected well before we actually announce our decisions.",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","changes in financial conditions begin to affect economic activity fairly quickly,",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","But it’s likely to take some time to see the full effects of changing financial conditions on inflation.",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","So we are very much mindful for that.",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","And that’s why I noted in my opening remarks that,",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","as the stance of policy tightens further,",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","it will become appropriate to slow the pace of rate hikes while we assess how our cumulative policy adjustments are affecting the economy and inflation.",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","So that’s how we think about that.",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","I should know better than to answer your second question.",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","So I think it’s very hard to say with precise certainty the way this is going to unfold.",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","what we think we need to do and should do is to move our policy rate to a restrictive level that’s restrictive enough to bring inflation down to 2 percent,",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","where we have confidence of that.",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","And what you see in the SEP numbers is people’s views as of today,",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","as to the kind of levels that will be appropriate.",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","and I think we’ll just have to see how that goes.",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","that we would go to a certain level that we’re confident in and stay there for a time.",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","into the very lowest level of what might be restrictive,",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","in my view and the view of the Committee,",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","there’s what I would characterize as a relatively modest increase in the unemployment rate from a historical perspective,",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","given the expected decline in inflation.",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","that is what we generally expect because we see the current situation as outside of historical experience in a number of ways,",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","and I’ll mention a couple of those.",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","First—and you know these—but first,",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","job of an increase in unemployment as has happened in earlier historical episodes.",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","longer-run inflation expectations have generally been fairly well anchored,",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","there’s no basis for complacency there.",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","But to the extent that continues to be the case,",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","that should make it easier to restore price stability.",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","And I guess the third thing I would point to that’s different this time is that part of this inflation is caused by this series of supply shocks that we’ve had,",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","with the reopening of the economy,",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","and more recently amplified and added to by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine—have all contributed to the sharp increase in inflation.",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","So these are the kinds of events that are not really seen in prior business cycles,",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","if those things start to get better—and we do see some evidence of the beginnings of that.",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","It’s not much more than that, but it’s good to see that.",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","commodity prices look like they may have peaked for now;",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","supply chain disruptions are beginning to resolve.",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","Those developments, if sustained, could help ease the pressures on inflation.",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","how much these factors will turn out to really matter in this sequence of events—it remains to be seen.",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","We have always understood that restoring price stability while achieving a relatively modest decline—or,",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","increase—in unemployment and a soft landing would be very challenging.",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","And we don’t know—no one knows whether this process will lead to a recession or,",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","how significant that recession would be.",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","That’s going to depend on how quickly wage and price inflation pressures come down,",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","inflation back down to 2 percent—because we think that a failure to restore price stability would mean far greater pain later on.",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","Yes, vacancies are still almost a 2-to-1 ratio to unemployed people.",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","That and quits are really very good ways to look at how tight the labor market is and how different it is from other cycles, where, generally, the unemployment rate itself is the single best indicator.",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","We think those things have, for quite a time now, really added value in terms of understanding where the labor market is.",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","we believe that we need to raise our policy stance overall to a level that is restrictive—and by that I mean,",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","putting meaningful downward pressure on inflation.",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","That’s what we need to see in the stance of policy.",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","real and nominal in some cases;",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","you look at financial conditions indexes.",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","I would think—and you see this in the—this is something we talked about today in the meeting and talk about in all of our meetings.",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","And you see this, I think, in the Committee forecast.",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","You want to be at a place where real rates are positive across the entire yield curve.",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","And I think that would be the case if you look at the numbers that we’re writing down and think about—you measure those against some sort of forward-looking assessment of inflation,",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","I think you would see at that time—you’d see positive real rates across the yield curve,",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","and that is also an important consideration.",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","So we make one decision per meeting,",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","and the decision we made today was to raise the federal funds rate by 75 [basis points].",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","You’re right that the median for the year-end suggests another 125 basis points in rate increases,",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","there’s another fairly large group that saw a 100 basis points addition to where we are today.",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","So that would be 25 basis points less.",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","So we’re going to make that decision at the meeting.",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","We didn’t make that decision today; we didn’t vote on that.",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","I would say that we’re committed to getting to a restrictive level for the federal funds rate and getting there pretty quickly,",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","and that’s what we’re thinking about.",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","What’s the incentive to continue front-loading right now?",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","Is it lack of progress on inflation seen in the CPI reports?",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","Or is it a motivation to get as much done while the job market is still as strong as it is?",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","inflation has—our expectation has been that we would begin to see inflation come down,",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","largely because of supply-side healing.",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","By now we would have thought that we’d have seen some of that.",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","We have seen some supply- side healing, but inflation has not really come down.",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","If you look at core PCE inflation,",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","which is a good measure of where inflation is running now,",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","and 12-month trailing annualized basis,",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","you’ll see that inflation is at 4.8 percent,",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","So that’s a pretty good summary of where we are with inflation.",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","And that’s not where we expected or wanted to be.",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","what that tells us is that we need to continue,",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","and we did today—do another large increase as we approach the level that we think we need to get to.",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","And we’re still discovering what that level is.",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","But people are writing that down in their SEP where they think policy needs to be.",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","So that’s how we’re thinking about it.",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","So I guess core is at 2.1 in 2025—in the median—and headline is at 2.0, so that’s pretty close.",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","I mean, we write down our forecasts, and we figure out what the than 2 percent.",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","as we said at the last press conference and in between that one and this one,",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","we said that we would make our decision based on the overall data coming in.",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","we got a surprisingly low reading in July and then a surprisingly high reading for August.",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","So I think you have to—you can’t really—you never want to overreact too much to any one data point.",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","So if you look at them together—and,",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","if you really look at this year’s inflation,",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","you see inflation is running too high.",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","It’s running 4.5 percent or above; you don’t need to know much more than that.",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","If that’s the one thing you know,",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","you know that this Committee is committed to getting to a meaningfully restrictive stance of policy and staying there until we feel confident that inflation is coming down.",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","I think a number of things might affect that decision, really.",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","The main thing is, we’re not considering that decision, and I don’t expect that we will any time soon.",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","a number of my FOMC colleagues and I,",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","just got back from one of our frequent trips to Basel,",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","to meet with other senior central bank officials from around the world.",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","We are in pretty regular contact,",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","of course—we all serve a domestic mandate,",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","maximum employment and price stability.",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","But we regularly discuss what we’re seeing in terms of our own economy and international spillovers,",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","So we are very aware of what’s going on in other economies around the world and what that means for us,",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","The forecasts that we put together,",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","and that we put together on our own always take all of that—try to take all of that into account.",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","I major economies that can have an effect on the",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","You’re right, of course—the labor market, in particular, has been very strong.",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","But there are—the sectors of the economy that are most interest rate sensitive are certainly showing the effects of our tightening,",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","the obvious example is housing,",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","having an effect on exports and imports.",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","I think—so all of that’s happening,",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","People have savings on their balance sheet from the period when they couldn’t spend and where they were getting government transfers.",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","There’s still very significant savings out there,",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","although not as much at the lower end of the income spectrum—but still,",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","some savings out there to support growth.",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","The states are very flush with cash,",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","so there’s good reason to think that this will continue to be a reasonably strong economy.",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","the data sort of are showing that growth is going to be below trend this year.",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","We think of trend as being about 1.8 percent, or in that range.",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","We’re forecasting growth well below that, and most forecasters are.",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","But you’re right—there’s certainly a possibility that growth can be stronger than that.",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","because that means the economy will be more resistant to a significant downturn.",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","we are focused on the thing I started with,",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","which is getting inflation back down to 2 percent.",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","if we were to fail to do that,",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","that would be the thing that would be most painful for the people that we serve.",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","that has to be our overarching focus,",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","in the levels of rates that we’ll be moving to reasonably quickly,",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","assuming things turn out roughly in line with the",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","So I don’t know what the odds are.",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","I think that there’s a very high likelihood that we’ll have a period of what I’ve mentioned is below-trend growth,",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","by which I mean much lower growth,",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","this year among my colleagues and me was 0.2 percent growth.",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","And then below trend next year.",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","I think the median was 1.2, also well below.",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","that’s a very slow level of growth,",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","and it could give rise to increases in unemployment.",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","so that is something that we think we need to have,",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","and we think we need to have softer labor market conditions as well.",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","We’re never going to say that there are too many people working,",""

"2022-09-21","Q&A","really light the way to another period of a very strong labor market,",""

"2022-09-21","Q&A","I wish there were a painless way to do that.",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","what we need to do is get rates up to the point where we’re putting meaningful downward pressure on inflation,",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","we certainly haven’t given up the idea that we can have a relatively modest increase in unemployment.",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","Nonetheless, we need to complete this task.",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","It’s hard to hypothetically deal with that question.",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","I mean, again, our really tight focus now continues to be ongoing rate increases to get the policy rate up where it",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","So, for starters, people are seeing their wage increases eaten up by inflation.",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","So if your family is one where you spend most of your paycheck,",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","and prices go up the way they’ve been going up,",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","and this is very painful for people at the lower end of the income and wealth spectrum.",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","So that’s what we’re hearing from people is,",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","very much—that inflation is really hurting.",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","So how do we get rid of inflation?",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","it would be nice if there were a way to just wish it away,",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","We have to get supply and demand back into alignment,",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","and the way we do that is by slowing the economy.",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","we do that by slowing the economy,",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","and we see some softening in labor market conditions,",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","and we see a big contribution from supply-side improvements,",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","But none of that is guaranteed.",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","really saw that for a long time.",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","The United States had 2 percent inflation,",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","and that was enormously beneficial to the public that we serve.",""

"2022-09-21","Q&A","To pull back from the task of doing that is,",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","you’re just postponing—the record shows that if you postpone that,",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","the delay is only likely to lead to more pain.",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","So I think we’re moving to do what we need to do and do our jobs,",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","and that’s what you see us doing.",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","it really depends on how long it takes for wages and,",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","prices to come down for inflation to come down.",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","And so what you see in our projections today is that inflation moves down significantly over the course of next year and then more the next year after that.",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","And I think once you’re on that path, that’s a good thing.",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","And things will start to feel better to people—they’ll feel lower inflation,",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","they’ll feel that the economy is improving.",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","if our projections are close to right,",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","you’ll see that the costs in unemployment are,",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","and they’re certainly very meaningful to the people who lose their jobs.",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","And we talk about that in our meetings quite a lot.",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","we’d be setting the economy up for another long period—this era has been noted for very long expansions.",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","We’ve had three of the four longest in measured what we saw in 2018,",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","which was very low unemployment,",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","the biggest wage gains going to people at the low end of the spectrum,",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","the smallest racial gaps that we’ve seen since we started keeping track of that.",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","So we want to get back to that.",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","we’re going to have to get supply and demand back in alignment,",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","and that’s going to take tight monetary policy for a period of time.",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","and a softening labor market are all painful for the public that we serve.",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","But they’re not as painful as failing to restore price stability and then having to come back and do it down the road again and doing it at a time when,",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","now people have really come to expect high inflation.",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","If the concept of high inflation becomes entrenched in people’s economic thinking about their decisions,",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","then sort of getting back to price stability—the cost of getting back to price stability just rises,",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","We want to act aggressively now and get this job done and keep at it until it’s done.",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","So when I say “reset,” I’m not looking at a particular,",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","specific set of data or anything.",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","What I’m really saying is that we’ve had a time of a red-hot housing market all over the country,",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","houses were selling to the first buyer at 10 percent above the ask,",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","So there was a big imbalance between supply and demand.",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","Housing prices were going up at an unsustainably fast level.",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","So the deceleration in housing prices that we’re seeing should help bring sort of prices more closely in line with rents and other housing market fundamentals,",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","what we need is supply and demand to get better aligned so that housing prices go up at a reasonable level—at a reasonable pace—and that people can afford houses again.",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","And I think we—so we probably,",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","have to go through a correction to get back to that place.",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","There’s also, there are also longer-run issues, though, with the housing market.",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","we’re—it’s difficult to find lots now close enough to cities and things like that,",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","so builders are having a hard time getting zoning and lots and workers and materials and things like that.",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","But from a sort of business cycle standpoint,",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","this difficult correction should put the housing market back into better balance.",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","I think that shelter inflation is going to remain high for some time.",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","We’re looking for it to come down, but it’s not exactly clear when that will happen.",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","when we get to—if we—let’s assume we do get to that level,",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","you’re going to adjust that for some forward-looking measure of inflation.",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","And that could be—you pick your measure.",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","It could be—there are all kinds of different things you could pick and you get—but what you’ll get is a positive number.",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","you will get forward inflation expectations in the short term,",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","assuming that we’re doing our jobs appropriately,",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","So you’ll have a positive [real] federal funds rate at that point,",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","which could be 1 percent or so,",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","I don’t know exactly what it would be.",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","But it would be significantly positive when we get to that level.",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","we’ve written down what we think is a plausible path for the federal funds rate.",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","The path that we actually execute will be enough.",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","It will be enough to restore price stability.",""
"2022-09-21","Q&A","and we’re going to continue to watch incoming data and the evolving outlook and ask ourselves whether our policy is in the right place as we go.",""
"2022-11-02","Opening Statement","My colleagues and I are strongly committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal.",""
"2022-11-02","Opening Statement","We have both the tools that we need and the resolve it will take to restore price stability on behalf of American families and businesses.",""
"2022-11-02","Opening Statement","Price stability is the responsibility of the Federal Reserve and serves as the bedrock of our economy.",""
"2022-11-02","Opening Statement","Without price stability, the economy does not work for anyone.",""
"2022-11-02","Opening Statement","we will not achieve a sustained period of strong labor market conditions that benefit all.",""
"2022-11-02","Opening Statement","Today, the FOMC raised our policy interest rate by 75 basis points.",""
"2022-11-02","Opening Statement","And we continue to anticipate that ongoing increases will be appropriate.",""
"2022-11-02","Opening Statement","We are moving our policy stance purposefully to a level that will be sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2 percent.",""
"2022-11-02","Opening Statement","we are continuing the process of significantly reducing the size of our balance sheet.",""
"2022-11-02","Opening Statement","Restoring price stability will likely require maintaining a restrictive stance of policy for some time.",""
"2022-11-02","Opening Statement","I will have more to say about today’s monetary policy actions after briefly reviewing economic developments.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","We do need to see inflation coming down decisively,",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","and good evidence of that would be a series of down monthly readings.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","that’s what we’d all love to see,",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","but that’s—I’ve never thought of that as the appropriate test for slowing the pace of increases or for identifying the appropriately restrictive level that we’re aiming for.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","We need to bring our policy stance down to a level that’s sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation down to our 2 percent objective over the medium term.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","How will we know that we’ve reached that level?",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","we’ll take into account the full range of analysis and data that bear on that question,",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","guided by our assessment of how much financial conditions have tightened,",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","the effects that that tightening is actually having on the real economy and on inflation,",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","what I want to do is put that question of pace in the context of our broader tightening program,",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","and talk about the statement language along the way.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","So I think you can think about our tightening program as really addressing three questions,",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","The second is how high to raise our policy rate.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","And the third will be, eventually, how long to remain at a restrictive level.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","So on the first question—how fast to tighten policy—it’s been very important that we move expeditiously,",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","We’ve moved 3¾ percent since March, admittedly from a base of zero.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","It’s a historically fast pace,",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","and that’s certainly appropriate given the persistence and strength in inflation and the low level from which we started.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","So now we come to the second question,",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","which is how high to raise our policy rate.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","And we’re saying that we’d raise that rate to a level that’s sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation to our 2 percent target over time,",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","and we put that into our postmeeting statement because that really does become the important question,",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","And I’ll talk more about that.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","We think there’s some ground to cover before we meet that test,",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","and that’s why we say that ongoing rate increases will be appropriate.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","incoming data between the meetings,",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","both a strong labor market report but particularly the CPI report,",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","do suggest to me that Of course,",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","with the lags between policy and economic activity,",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","so we note that in determining the pace of future increases,",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","we’ll take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy as well as the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","as we come closer to that level,",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","move more into restrictive territory,",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","the question of speed becomes less important than the second and third questions.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","And that’s why I’ve said at the last two press conferences that at some point,",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","it will become appropriate to slow the pace of increases.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","and it may come as soon as the next meeting or the one after that.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","It is likely we’ll have a discussion about this at the next meeting, a discussion.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","let me say again [that] the question of when to moderate the pace of increases is now much less important than the question of how high to raise rates and how long to keep monetary policy restricted,",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","which really will be our principal focus.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","Well, I think I’m pleased that we have moved as fast as we have.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","I don’t think we’ve overtightened.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","I think there’s—very difficult to make a case that our current level is too tight,",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","given that inflation still runs well above the federal funds rate.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","So I think that at this meeting,",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","I’ve said that we—that there would come a point,",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","and this was a meeting at which we had a discussion about what that might good and a successful program that we’ve gotten this far this fast.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","that we still think there’s a need for ongoing rate increases,",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","and we have some ground left to cover here,",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","does the policy rate need to get above the inflation rate?",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","And I would say, there are a range of views on it.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","That’s the classic “Taylor principle” view.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","But I would think you’d look more at a forward,",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","a forward-looking measure of inflation to look at that.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","we’ll want to get the policy rate to a level where it is,",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","where the real interest rate is positive.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","I do not think of it as the single and only touchstone, though.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","I think you put some weight on that;",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","you also put some weight on rates across the curve.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","Very few people borrow at the short end—at the federal funds rate, for example.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","if they’re [borrowing]—[there are] very meaningfully positive interest rates all across the curve for them,",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","so borrowing rates are significantly higher,",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","and I think financial conditions have tightened quite a bit.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","So I would look at that as an important feature.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","but I wouldn’t say it’s something that is the single,",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","I don’t have a specific number for you there.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","There are many, many models that look at that.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","one way to look at it is that it’s a pretty stationary object and that when inflation runs—above that level,",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","for sure—substantially above for some time,",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","you’ll see it move up,",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","but the movement will be fairly gradual.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","So I think that’s what the principal models would tend to say.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","But I wouldn’t want to land on any one assessment.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","There are many different—as you know, many different people publish an assessment of underlying inflation.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","So I guess I would start by pointing to expectations.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","So if we saw longer-term expectations moving up, that would be very troubling.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","And they were moving up a little bit at the middle part of this year,",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","and they’ve moved now back down.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","Shorter-term inflation expectations moved up between the last meeting and this meeting,",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","and we don’t think those are as indicative,",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","but they may be important in the wage-setting process.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","There’s a school of thought that believes that.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","I guess the other thing I would say is that the longer we have—we’re now 18 months into this episode of high inflation,",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","and we don’t have a clearly identified,",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","scientific way of under control—get it down to 2 percent—get it behind us.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","That’s what we really need to do and what we’re strongly committed to doing.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","So the way I would think about that is,",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","thought that monetary policy works with “long and variable lags,” and that it works first on financial conditions and then on economic activity and then perhaps later than that even on inflation.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","So that’s been the thinking for a long time.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","There was an old literature that made those lags out to be fairly long.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","There’s newer literature that says that they’re shorter.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","we don’t have a lot of data [consisting] of inflation of [rates] this high in what is,",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","One big difference now is that it used to be that you would raise the federal funds rate,",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","and then that would affect economic activity and inflation.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","Now financial conditions react well before in expectation of monetary policy [actions].",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","That’s the way it has moved for a quarter of a century—in the direction of financial conditions,",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","then monetary policy—because the markets are thinking,",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","what is the central bank going to do?",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","And there are plenty of economists that also think that once financial conditions change,",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","that the effects on the economy are actually faster than they would have been before.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","We don’t know But you want to consider them but not take them literally.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","So I think it’s a very difficult place to be,",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","but I would tend to be—want to be in the middle looking carefully at what’s actually happening with the economy and trying to make good decisions from a risk-management standpoint,",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","that if we were to overtighten,",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","we could then use our tools strongly to support the economy,",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","whereas if we don’t get inflation under control because we don’t tighten enough,",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","now we’re in a situation where inflation will become entrenched and the costs,",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","the employment costs in particular,",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","will be much higher potentially.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","So from a risk- management standpoint,",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","we want to be sure that we don’t make the mistake of either failing to tighten enough or loosening policy too soon.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","I think as we move now into restrictive territory,",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","as we make these ongoing rate hikes and policy becomes more restrictive,",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","it’ll be appropriate now to be thinking more about lags.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","we think about lags—the lags are just sort of a basic part of monetary policy.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","But we will be thinking about them,",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","but we won’t be—I think we’ll be considering them but because it’s appropriate to do so.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","Let me say this: It is very premature to be thinking about pausing.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","So people, when they hear lags, they think about a pause.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","to think about or be talking about pausing our rate hike.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","Our policy—we need ongoing rate hikes to get to that level of sufficiently restrictive.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","And we don’t—of course, we don’t really know exactly where that is.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","We have a sense, and we’re seeing with incoming data.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","I don’t know that the channels through which policy works have changed that much.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","I would say a big channel is the labor market,",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","And households, of course, have strong balance sheets.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","So we go into this with a strong labor market and excess demand in the labor market,",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","as you can see through many different things,",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","and also with households who have strong spending power built up.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","So it may take time, it may take resolve, it may take patience.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","It’s likely to, to get inflation down.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","from our forecasts and others,",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","that it will take some time for inflation to come down.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","So, sorry, was I getting to your question there?",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","Oh, housing—the housing part of it.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","so we look at housing—of course,",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","housing is significantly affected by these higher rates,",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","which are really back where they were before the Global Financial Crisis—they’re not historically high,",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","but they’re much higher housing was—the housing market was very overheated for the couple of years after the pandemic as demand increased and rates were low.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","We all know the stories of how overheated the housing market was, prices going up.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","Many, many bidders and no conditions, that kind of thing.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","So the housing market needs to get back into a balance between supply and demand.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","We’re well aware of what’s going on there.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","From a financial stability standpoint,",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","we didn’t see in this cycle the kinds of poor credit underwriting that we saw before the Global Financial Crisis.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","Housing credit was very carefully—much more carefully managed by the lenders.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","So it’s a very different situation and doesn’t present potential financial—doesn’t appear to present financial stability issues.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","we do understand that that’s really where a very big effect of our policy is.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","So we talk a lot about vacancies in the—vacancy-to-unemployed rate,",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","it’s just another data series.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","It’s been unusually important in this cycle because it’s been so out of line.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","So we look at a very wide range of data on the unemployment—on the labor market.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","So I’d start with unemployment,",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","we thought we would get that back.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","Most analysts thought we would get some labor supply coming in.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","so I guess I would characterize that as sort of a mixed picture.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","you see—so I would call it a flattening out at a level that’s well above the level that would be consistent over time with 2 percent inflation,",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","With the ECI reading this week, again, a mixed picture.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","The headline number was a disappointment.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","There’s some rays of light inside that if you look at private-sector workers—that did come down,",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","that compensation did come down.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","the broader picture is of an overheated labor market where demand substantially exceeds supply.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","Job creation still exceeds sort of the level that would hold the market where it is.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","Do we see—we keep looking for signs that sort of the beginning of a gradual softening is happening.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","because wages aren’t coming down—they’re just moving sideways at an elevated level,",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","both ECI and average hourly earnings.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","We want to see—we would love to see vacancies coming down, quits coming down.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","Vacancies are below their all-time high but not by as much as we thought,",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","because—and the data series is volatile,",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","we never take any one reading,",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","we always look at two or three.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","I don’t see the case for real softening just yet.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","we look at a very broad range of data on the labor market.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","we keep close tabs on economic developments and also geopolitical developments that are relevant to the economy abroad.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","We’re in very frequent contact with our foreign counterparts both through the IMF meetings and the regular meetings with central banks that we have,",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","and I have one this weekend with many,",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","So we’re in touch with all of that.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","So I guess what—it’s clearly a time, a difficult time in the global economy.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","We’re seeing very high inflation in Europe,",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","significantly because of high energy prices related to the war in Ukraine.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","And we’re seeing China’s having issues with the take all of that into account in our models.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","We think about the spillovers and that sort of thing.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","and we have an economy where inflation is running at 5 percent.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","Core PCE inflation—which is a really good indicator of what’s going on for us,",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","the way we see it—is running at 5.1 percent on a 12-month basis and sort of similar to that on a 3-,",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","So we know that we need to use our tools to get inflation under control.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","The world’s not going to be better off if we fail to do that.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","Price stability in the United States is a good thing for the global economy over a long period of time.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","Price stability is the kind of thing that pays dividends for our economy—for decades,",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","hopefully—even though it may be difficult to get it back.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","Getting it back is something that gives—that provides value to the people we serve for the long run.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","but the demand channel does affect them just at the margin.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","The thing about the United States is that we also have strong—in many other jurisdictions,",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","the principal problem really is energy.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","In the United States, we also have a demand issue.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","We’ve got an imbalance between demand and supply,",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","which you see in many parts of the economy.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","So our tools are well suited to work on that problem,",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","We don’t—the price of oil is inflation by the things that we do,",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","even in times when energy is part of the story of why inflation is high.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","So you’re right—the public’s trust is really the Fed’s and any central bank’s most important asset,",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","violates or falls short of those rules,",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","we do risk undermining that trust,",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","and we take that very seriously.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","So at the beginning of our meeting yesterday,",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","we had a Committee discussion of the full Committee on the importance of holding ourselves individually and collectively accountable for knowing and following the high standard that’s set out in our existing rules with respect to both personal investment activities and external communications.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","And we’ve taken a number of steps,",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","and I would just say we do understand how important those issues are.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","I would say that our new investment program that we have is up now and running,",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","it was through that that the problems with President Bostic’s disclosures were discovered,",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","when he filed his new disclosure.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","We now have a central group here at the Board of Governors that looks into disclosures and follows them and approves people’s disclosures and also all of their trades.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","And we—I think we all said to each other today— yesterday,",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","we recommitted to each other and to this institution to hold ourselves to the highest standards and avoid these problems.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","So, as you know, I referred the matter concerning President Bostic to the inspector general, and once that happens, I don’t discuss it with the inspector general or with anybody.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","It’s just—the inspector general has, he has the ability to do investigations.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","Well, so we do monitor the near-term forward spread—you’re right.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","And it’s—that’s been our preferred measure.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","We think, just empirically, it dominates the ones that people tend to look at, which is 2s, 10s, and things like that.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","And, also, you have to look at why things—why the rate curve is doing what it’s doing.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","It can be doing that because it affects—it expects cuts or because it expects inflation to come down.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","In this case, if you’re in a situation where the markets are pricing in significant declines in inflation, that’s",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","and we’ve raised interest rates by 375 basis points.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","I would not—I would not change a word in that statement, though.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","I think until we get inflation down, you’ll be hearing that from me.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","if we overtighten—and we don’t want to,",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","we want to get this exactly right—but if we overtighten,",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","then we have the ability with our tools,",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","as we showed at the beginning of the pandemic episode,",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","we can support economic activity strongly if that happens,",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","if you make the mistake in the other direction and you let this drag on,",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","then it’s a year or two down the road,",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","inflation behaving the way it can,",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","you’re realizing you didn’t actually get it,",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","By then, the risk, really, is that it has become entrenched in people’s thinking.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","And the record is that the employment costs—the cost to the people that we don’t want to hurt—they go up with the passage of time.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","That’s really how I look at it.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","So that isn’t going to change.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","What has changed, though—you’re right—is, we’re farther along now.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","And I think as we’re farther along, we’re now focused on that.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","What’s the place, what’s the level we need to get to rates?",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","And I don’t know what we’ll do when we get there, by the way.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","There’s been no decision or discussion around exactly what steps we would take at that point.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","But the first thing is to find your way there.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","So this is an interesting subject.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","that the measure that’s in the CPI and the PCE,",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","it captures rents for all tenants,",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","that is—that’s sort of the right target for monetary policy.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","And the same thing is true for owners’ equivalent rent,",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","which comes off of—it’s a reweighting of tenant rents.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","and they tell you a couple things.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","if you look at the pattern of that series of the new leases,",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","so rents went up much more than the CPI and PCE rents did.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","And now they’re coming down faster.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","But what you’re—the implication is that there are still,",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","as non-new leases roll over and expire,",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","they’re still in the pipeline,",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","there’s still some significant rate increases coming,",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","the new leases are going to tell you—what they’re telling you is,",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","there will come a point at which rent inflation will start to come down.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","But that point is well out from where we are now.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","So we’re well aware of that, of course, and we look at it.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","But I would say that in terms of—the right way to think about inflation,",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","is to look at the measure that we do look at,",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","but considering that we also know that at some point,",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","Is that a problem or what—how that might affect your future policy to see this positive reaction?",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","We’re not targeting any one or two particular things.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","Our message should be—what I’m trying to do is make sure that our message is clear,",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","which is that we think we have a ways to go,",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","we have some ground to cover with interest rates before we get to,",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","before we get to that level of interest rates that we think is sufficiently restrictive.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","And putting that in the statement and identifying that as a goal is an important step.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","And that’s meant to put that question, really, as the important one now, going forward.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","I’ve also said that we think that the level of rates that we estimated in September—the incoming data suggests that that’s actually going to be higher,",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","I would have little confidence that the forecast—if we made a forecast today,",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","if we were doing an SEP today,",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","but there’s no sense that inflation is coming down.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","If you look at the—I have a table of the last 12 months of 12-month readings,",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","and there’s really no pattern there.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","We’re exactly where we were a year ago.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","So I would also say, it’s premature to discuss pausing.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","And it’s not something that we’re thinking about.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","That’s really not a conversation to be had now.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","And the last thing I’ll say is that I would want people to understand our commitment to getting this done and to not making the mistake of not doing enough or the mistake of withdrawing our strong policy and doing that too soon.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","So those—I control those messages, and that’s my job.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","So how big of a headwind is all the fiscal spending to what the Federal Reserve’s trying to do to get inflation back to the 2 percent target?",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","but I do think the broader context is that you have households that have these significant amounts of savings and can keep spending even in—so I think those two things do tend to wage—to sort of counterbalance each other out.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","It appears, consumer spending is still positive—it’s at pretty modest growth levels.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","The banks that deal with retail customers and many retailers will tell you that the consumers are still buying and they’re still—they’re fine.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","So I don’t know how big the fiscal headwinds are,",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","and they haven’t shown up in the way that we thought they would in restraining spending.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","So it must have to do with the savings that people have.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","Demand is going to have some support from those savings and also from the strong demand that’s still in the labor market.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","We still see pretty significant demand and a tightening labor market in some respects,",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","I would say it’s not really tightening or loosening.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","and what those things tell us is that our job is going to require some resolve and some patience over time.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","We’re going to have to stick with this.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","And that’s just—we take all that as a given,",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","but we know what our objective is,",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","and we know what our tools can do,",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","and that’s how we think about it.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","We’ve always said it was going to be difficult,",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","but I think to the extent rates have to go higher and stay higher for longer,",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","it becomes harder to see the path—it’s narrowed.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","I would say the path has narrowed over the course of the last year, really.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","I would say that the sort of array of data in the labor market is highly unusual and,",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","there is a path to— ordinarily there’s a relationship to GDP going down and vacancies declining,",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","So all those things are relationships that are in the data, and they’re very real.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","Data’s a little bit different this time,",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","because you have this tremendously high level of vacancies and,",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","on a very steep part of the Beveridge curve.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","All I would say is that the job losses may turn out to be less than would be indicated by those traditional measures,",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","because job openings are so elevated and because the labor market is so strong.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","Again, that’s going to be something we discover empirically.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","I think no one knows whether there’s going to be a recession or not and,",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","how bad that recession would be.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","And our job is to restore price stability so that we can have a strong labor market that benefits all over time.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","And that’s what we’re going to do.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","Because we haven’t seen inflation coming down.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","The implication of inflation not coming down.",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","What we would expect by now to have seen is that as the—really,",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","as the supply-side problems have resolved themselves,",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","we would have expected goods inflation to services inflation moving up,",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","and I just think that the inflation picture has become more and more challenging over the course of this year,",""
"2022-11-02","Q&A","That means that we have to have policy be more restrictive, and that narrows the path to a soft landing, I would say.",""
"2022-12-14","Opening Statement","Before I go into the details of today’s meeting,",""
"2022-12-14","Opening Statement","I would like to underscore for the American people that we understand the hardship that high inflation is causing and that we are strongly committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal.",""
"2022-12-14","Opening Statement","we have taken forceful actions to tighten the stance of monetary policy.",""
"2022-12-14","Opening Statement","We have covered a lot of ground,",""
"2022-12-14","Opening Statement","and the full effects of our rapid tightening so far are yet to be felt.",""
"2022-12-14","Opening Statement","Even so, we have more work to do.",""
"2022-12-14","Opening Statement","Price stability is the responsibility of the Federal Reserve and serves as the bedrock of our economy.",""
"2022-12-14","Opening Statement","Without price stability, the economy doesn’t work for anyone.",""
"2022-12-14","Opening Statement","we will not achieve a sustained period of strong labor market conditions that benefit all.",""
"2022-12-14","Opening Statement","Today, the FOMC raised our policy interest rate by ½ percentage point.",""
"2022-12-14","Opening Statement","We continue to anticipate that ongoing increases will be appropriate in order to attain a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2 percent over time.",""
"2022-12-14","Opening Statement","we are continuing the process of significantly reducing the size of our balance sheet.",""
"2022-12-14","Opening Statement","Restoring price stability will likely require maintaining a restrictive policy stance for some time.",""
"2022-12-14","Opening Statement","I will have more to say about today’s monetary policy actions after briefly reviewing economic developments.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","it is important that overall financial conditions continue to reflect the policy restraint that we’re putting in place to bring inflation down to 2 percent.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","We think that financial conditions have tightened significantly in the past year.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","But our policy actions work through financial conditions.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","And those, in turn, affect economic activity, the labor market, and inflation.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","So what we control is our policy moves in the communications that we make.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","Financial conditions both anticipate, and react to, our actions.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","I would add that our focus is not on short-term moves, but on persistent moves.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","And many, many things, of course, move financial conditions over time.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","I would say it’s our judgment today that we’re not at a sufficiently restrictive policy stance yet,",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","which is why we say that we would expect that ongoing hikes would be appropriate.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","And I would point you to the SEP again for our current assessment of what that peak level will be.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","19 people filled out the SEP this time,",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","and 17 of those 19 wrote down a peak rate of 5 percent or more—in the 5s.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","So that’s our best assessment today for what we think the peak rate will be.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","was published shows again that,",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","FOMC participants believe that inflation risks are to the upside.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","So I can’t tell you confidently that we won’t move up our estimate of the peak rate again at the next",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","as we’ve gone through the course of this year,",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","as we lifted off and got into the course of the year and we saw the—how strong inflation was and how persistent,",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","it was very important to move quickly.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","In fact, the speed—the pace with which we’re moving was the most important thing.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","I think now that we’re coming to the end of this year,",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","we’ve raised 425 basis points this year,",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","and we’re into restrictive territory.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","It’s now not so important how fast we go.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","It’s far more important to think, what is the ultimate level?",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","And then it’s—at a certain point,",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","how long do we remain restrictive?",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","That will become the most important question.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","But I would say the most important question now is no longer the speed.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","So—and that applies to February as well.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","that question about how high to raise rates is going to be one that we make looking at our progress on inflation,",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","looking at where financial conditions are,",""

"2022-12-14","Q&A","we have an assessment that we’re not at a restrictive enough stance,",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","And we’ve laid out our own—our individual assessments of what we would need to do to get there.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","At a certain point, though, we’ll get to that point.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","And then the question will be, how long do we stay there?",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","the strong view on the Committee is that we’ll need to stay there,",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","until we’re really confident that inflation is coming down in a sustained way.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","And we think that that will be some time.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","If you look at—you can break inflation down into three, sort of, buckets.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","that supply conditions would get better.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","and demand settles down a little bit and maybe goes back to services a little bit.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","And we start to see goods inflation coming down.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","We’re now starting to see that in this report and the last one.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","Then you go to housing services.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","We know the story there is that housing services inflation has been very,",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","very high and will continue to go up,",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","As rents expire and have to be renewed,",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","they’re going to be renewed into a market where rates are higher than they were when the original leases were signed.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","But we see that the new leases that are—that the rate for new leases is coming down.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","once we work our way through that backlog,",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","that inflation will function of the labor market,",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","The biggest cost, by far, in that sector is labor.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","one where we haven’t seen much softening,",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","where job growth is very high,",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","there’s an imbalance in the labor market between supply and demand.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","is likely to take a substantial period to get down.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","the goods inflation has turned pretty quickly now after not turning at all for a year and a half.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","that the services inflation will not move down so quickly,",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","so that we’ll have to stay at it,",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","so that we may have to raise rates higher to get to where we want to go.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","And that’s really why we are writing down those high rates and why we’re expecting that they’ll have to remain high for a time.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","Well, I’ll tell you what the projection is.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","I don’t think it would qualify as a recession, though, because you’ve got positive growth.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","The expectations in the SEP are basically as you said,",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","we’ve got growth at a modest level,",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","which is to say that In that condition,",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","labor market conditions are softening a bit.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","Unemployment does go up a bit.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","I would say that many analysts believe that the natural rate of unemployment is actually elevated at this moment.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","So it’s not clear that those forecasts of inflation are really much above the natural rate of unemployment.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","We can never identify its location with great precision.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","But that 4.7 percent is still a strong labor market.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","you’ve got—the reports we get from the field are that companies are very reluctant to lay people off,",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","other than the tech companies,",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","companies want to hold onto the workers they have because it’s been very,",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","So you’ve got all these vacancies out there—far in excess of the number of employed people.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","That doesn’t sound like a—you know,",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","a labor market where a lot of people will need to be put out of work.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","there are channels through which the labor market can come back into balance with relatively modest increases in unemployment,",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","None of that is guaranteed, but that is what their forecast reflects.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","As a—just a matter of practice, the SEP reflects any data that’s—that comes out during the meeting.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","And participants know that they have the—they know this—that they can make changes to their SEP during the meeting, you know, well in advance of the press conference so that we’re not running around.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","It’s never the case that the SEPs don’t reflect an important piece of data that came in on the first day of the meeting.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","It’s not about the strength of the labor market.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","The labor market is clearly very strong.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","we had expected—we’ve continually expected to make faster progress on inflation than we have,",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","And that’s why the peak rate for this year goes up between this meeting and the September meeting.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","You see that—you see the fact that we’ve made less progress than expected on inflation.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","And that’s why unemployment goes up, because we’re having to tighten policy more.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","And so it didn’t go up by much in the meeting, I don’t think.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","is slower progress on inflation,",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","probably higher rates probably held for longer just to get to where you—the kind of restriction that you need to get inflation down to 2 percent.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","You know, there—you can look at history, right?",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","the declines in unemployment would be more meaningful,",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","than what you see written down there.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","But why do we think that is the case?",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","So, I’ll give you a few reasons.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","First just is that there’s this huge overhang of vacancies,",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","meaning that vacancies can come down a fair amount.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","And we’re hearing from many companies that they don’t want to lay people off—so that they’ll keep people because it’s been so hard.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","I think we’ve—it feels like we have a structural labor shortage out there where there are,",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","a little more than 4 million who were in the may take longer,",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","but it also means that the costs in unemployment may be less.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","Again, that we’re going to find out empirically.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","But I think that’s a reasonably possible outcome.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","And you do hear, you know, many, many labor economists believe that it is.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","Well, I think that’s why one of the reasons it went up was that core came in stronger this year.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","What you see is our best estimate,",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","as of today—for how high we need to raise rates to—how much we need to tighten policy to create enough,",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","restrictive policy to slow economic activity and slow—soften the labor market and bring inflation down through those channels.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","That’s all—that is the estimate—best estimate—we make today.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","And, as I mentioned, we’ll make another estimate for the next",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","We’re going into next year with higher inflation than we had thought, right?",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","So we’re actually moving down to—the level that we’re moving down to next year is still a very large drop in inflation from where inflation is running now,",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","well more than 1 percent change in inflation.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","But remember that the jump[ing]-off point at the beginning of the year is higher.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","So, you know, we—we’re moving down still by a very large chunk.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","I don’t think it’s having—I don’t think the policy is having any less effect.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","It’s just starting from a higher level at the end of 2022.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","I believe the median is 3½ percent.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","That would be—that’s a pretty significant drop in inflation.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","And, you know, where’s it coming from?",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","It’s coming from the goods sector, clearly.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","we should begin to see lower inflation from the housing services sector.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","when we—how much will you see from the largest,",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","which is the non-housing services sector?",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","that’s where you need to see—we believe you need to see a better balancing of supply and demand in the labor market so that you have—it’s not that we don’t want wage increases.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","We want strong wage increases.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","We just want them to be at a level that’s consistent with 2 percent inflation.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","Right now that—if you put into—if you factor in productivity estimates,",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","well above what would be consistent with 2 percent inflation.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","our focus right now is really on moving our policy stance to one that is restrictive enough to ensure a return of inflation to our 2 percent goal over time.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","And we think that we’ll have to maintain a restrictive stance of policy for some time.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","Historical experience cautions strongly against prematurely loosening policy.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","I guess I would say it this way:",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","I wouldn’t see us considering rate cuts until the Committee is confident that inflation is moving down to 2 percent in a sustained way.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","So that’s the test I would articulate.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","There are not rate cuts in the SEP for 2023.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","Those two things will offset each other.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","Weaker output in China will push down on commodity prices,",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","but it could interfere with supply chains ultimately.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","And that could push inflation up in the West.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","It’s very hard to say, you know, how much—how those two will offset each other.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","that the overall net effect would be material on us.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","But, to your point, China faces a very challenging situation in reopening.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","waves of COVID all around the world can interfere with economic activity.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","China, a very critical manufacturing—place for manufacturing significant increases in",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","So the data that we’ve received so far for October and November,",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","we don’t have the—some of the—we have some remaining data to get in November,",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","but they clearly do show a welcome reduction in the monthly pace of price increases.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","As I mentioned in my opening statement,",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","it will take substantially more evidence to give confidence that inflation is on a sustained downward path.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","So the way we think about this is this:",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","This report is very much in line with what we’ve been expecting and hoping for.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","And what it does is, it provides greater confidence in our forecast of declining inflation.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","we’ve been expecting significant—forecasting significant declines in overall inflation and core inflation in the coming year.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","And this is the kind of reading that it will take to support that.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","this gives us greater confidence in our forecasts rather than,",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","we have been expecting goods inflation to come down as supply chain pressures eased.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","Housing services—as I should help.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","And the big piece, again, is core services, ex housing, which is very important.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","And we have a ways to go there.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","You do see some beginning signs there.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","But, ultimately, that’s the big—the more than half, as I mentioned, of PCE core index.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","And it’s very fundamentally about the labor market and wages.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","look at the average hourly earnings number we got with the last payrolls report,",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","you don’t really see much progress in terms of average hourly earnings coming down.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","Now, there may be composition effects and other effects in that.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","So we don’t put too much weight on any one report.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","These things can be volatile month to month.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","But we will be looking for wages moving,",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","down to more normal levels where workers are doing well and,",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","their gains are not being eaten up by inflation.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","So if I—I think I got your question.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","I think our policy’s in—getting into a pretty good place now.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","we’re getting close to that level of sufficient—we think—sufficiently welcome these better inflation reports for the last two months.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","But I think we’re realistic about the broader project.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","That’s the point I would make.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","It’s—you know, we see goods prices coming down.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","We understand what will happen with housing services.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","But the big story will really be the rest of it,",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","and there’s not much progress there.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","And that’s going to take some time.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","I think my view and my colleagues’ view is that this will take some time.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","We’ll have to hold policy at a restrictive level for a sustained period so that,",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","Of course, they’re very welcome.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","But we need to be honest with ourselves that there’s,",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","inflation—12-month core inflation is 6 percent",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","to the extent we need to keep rates higher and keep them there for longer and inflation,",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","I think that narrows the runway.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","But lower inflation readings, if they persist, in time, could certainly make it more possible.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","So I just—I don’t think anyone knows whether we’re going to have a recession or not and,",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","whether it’s going to be a deep one or not.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","were they to continue for a period of time,",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","would increase the likelihood of a— put it this way,",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","of a return to price stability that involves significantly less of an increase in unemployment than would be expected given the historical record.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","Americans of pain earlier this year as the Fed hikes rates.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","But with the Fed now expected to raise rates higher than you thought when you first said that,",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","just wondering where we are in that pain.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","How would you describe that to Americans if the projections on unemployment find themselves—that’d be 1.6 million Americans out of jobs?",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","So the largest amount of pain—the worst pain would come from a failure to raise rates high enough and from us allowing inflation to become entrenched in the economy so that the ultimate cost of getting it out of the economy would be very high in terms of employment,",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","meaning very high unemployment for extended periods of time,",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","the kind of thing that had to happen when inflation really got out of control and the Fed didn’t respond aggressively enough or soon enough in a prior episode,",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","So that’s really—the worst pain would be if we failed to act.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","What we’re doing now is, you know, it’s raising interest rates for people.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","And so people are paying higher rates on mortgages and that kind of thing.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","There will be some softening in labor market conditions.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","And I wish there were a completely painless way to restore price stability.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","And this is the best we can do.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","that—and markets are pretty confident,",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","it seems to me—that we will get inflation under control.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","We’re certainly highly committed to do that.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","changing our inflation goal is just something we’re not thinking about,",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","and it’s something we’re not going to think about.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","It’s—we have a 2 percent inflation goal,",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","and we’ll use our tools to get inflation back to 2 percent.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","I think this isn’t the time to be thinking about that.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","I mean, there may be a longer-run project at some point.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","But that is not where we are at all.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","The Committee—we’re not considering that.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","We’re not going to consider that under any circumstances.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","We’re going to keep our inflation target at 2 percent.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","We’re going to use our tools to get inflation back to 2 percent.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","So the—I would go back to the labor market that we had in 2018,",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","wage increases for the people at the lowest end of the income spectrum were the largest.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","The gaps between racial groups and gender groups were at their smallest in recorded history.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","That’s—and all of that because of a tight labor market,",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","a tight labor market which had inflation running,",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","just a tick below 2 percent and the economy growing right at its potential.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","So that seems like something that would be really good for the economy and for the country,",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","And so that’s what all of us want to do.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","We want to get back to a long expansion where the labor market can remain strong over an extended period of price stability.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","we can’t—what we have to think about is the medium and longer term.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","the country went through a difficult time—I think much more difficult than we can think it would happen here.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","But it really set up our economy for several decades of prosperity.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","So price stability is something that really pays dividends for the benefit of the economy and the people in it over a very,",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","it has to be restored and as quickly as possible—which is what we’re doing.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","We look at—it’s our regular practice to talk about unemployment rates by different groups, including racial groups and that sort of thing.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","So I don’t want to get into too many hypotheticals.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","But, you know, we’ll—it’s hard to deal with hypotheticals.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","So let me just say that we have to use our tools to support maximum employment and price stability.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","I’ve made it clear that right now, the labor market’s very, very strong.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","You’re near a 50-year low where you’re at or above maximum employment,",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","a 50-year low in unemployment,",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","wages—nominal wages getting inflation under control,",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","I think, as the economy heals, the two goals come more into play.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","But right now, clearly, the focus has to be on getting inflation down.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","with “structural labor shortage,” is,",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","if you look at where we are now,",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","there—if you just look at demand for labor,",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","you can look at vacancies plus people who are actually working.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","And then you can take supply of labor by,",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","“Are you in the labor market?” “Are you looking for a job or have a job?” And you’re 4— more than 4 million people short.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","We don’t see—despite very high wages and an incredibly tight labor market,",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","we don’t see participation moving up—which is contrary to what we thought.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","the labor market is actually—it should—it’s 3½ million people,",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","smaller than it should have been based on pre-pandemic.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","Just assume population and reasonable growth and aging of the population;",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","our labor force should be 3½ million more than it is.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","And that—there’re lots of easy ways to get to bigger numbers than that if you go back a few more years.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","Part of it is just accelerated retirements.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","People dropped out and aren’t coming back at a higher rate than expected.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","Part of it is that we lost a half a million We don’t prescribe—you know,",""

"2022-12-14","Q&A","I think if you ask businesses,",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","pretty much everybody you talk to says there aren’t enough people.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","So I tried to identify that in my—in a speech I gave a month ago,",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","but I stopped short of telling Congress what to do because,",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","And we need to, you know, do that job.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","I mean, what we do is, we make our forecasts, and we publish them quarterly.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","if you look at those forecasts,",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","those are forecasts for slow growth,",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","unemployment goes up but not a great deal.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","And you see inflation coming down.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","You see inflation coming down.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","Those are those forecasts, and that’s really what they show.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","this kind of a recession and that kind of a recession.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","We just, you know, we make those forecasts.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","The staff runs—and you will see this if you look at the old Tealbooks—runs alternative simulations of all different kinds at every meeting,",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","And those will explore different things.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","But that’s just, you know, upside and downside scenarios.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","Of course, that’s a responsible practice that",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","Of course, that’s something that we know we’d see.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","we wouldn’t—I wouldn’t see the Committee cutting rates until we’re confident that inflation is moving down in a sustained way.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","I don’t see us as having a really clear and precise understanding of what the neutral rate is and what real rates are so that it would mechanically happen like that.",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","it’ll be a test of—for cutting rates,",""
"2022-12-14","Q&A","do we actually feel confident that inflation is coming down in a sustained way?",""
"2023-02-01","Opening Statement","My colleagues and I understand the hardship that high inflation is causing,",""
"2023-02-01","Opening Statement","and we are strongly committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal.",""
"2023-02-01","Opening Statement","we have taken forceful actions to tighten the stance of monetary policy.",""
"2023-02-01","Opening Statement","We have covered a lot of ground,",""
"2023-02-01","Opening Statement","and the full effects of our rapid tightening so far are yet to be felt.",""
"2023-02-01","Opening Statement","Even so, we have more work to do.",""
"2023-02-01","Opening Statement","Price stability is the responsibility of the Federal Reserve and serves as the bedrock of our economy.",""
"2023-02-01","Opening Statement","Without price stability, the economy does not work for anyone.",""
"2023-02-01","Opening Statement","we will not achieve a sustained period of labor market conditions that benefit all.",""
"2023-02-01","Opening Statement","Today, the FOMC raised our policy interest rate by 25 basis points.",""
"2023-02-01","Opening Statement","We continue to anticipate that ongoing increases will be appropriate in order to attain a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2 percent over time.",""
"2023-02-01","Opening Statement","we are continuing the process of significantly reducing the size of our balance sheet.",""
"2023-02-01","Opening Statement","Restoring price stability will likely require maintaining a restrictive stance for some time.",""
"2023-02-01","Opening Statement","I will have more to say about today’s monetary policy actions after briefly reviewing economic developments.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","So it is important that overall financial conditions continue to reflect the policy restraint that we’re putting in place in order to bring inflation down to 2 percent.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","And, of course, financial conditions have tightened very significantly over the past year.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","I would say that our focus is not on short-term moves but on sustained changes to broader financial conditions.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","And it is our judgment that we’re not yet at a sufficiently restrictive policy stance,",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","which is why we say that we expect ongoing hikes will be appropriate.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","Of course, many things affect financial conditions—not just our policy.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","And we will take into account overall financial conditions along with many other factors as we set policy.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","So I would say it is a good thing that the disinflation that we have seen so far has not come at the expense of a weaker labor market.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","But I would also say that that disinflationary process that you now see under way is really at an early stage.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","in the goods sector you see inflation now coming down because supply chains have been fixed,",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","demand is shifting back to services,",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","and shortages have been abated.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","In the other—in the housing services sector,",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","we expect inflation to continue moving up for a while but then to come down,",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","assuming that [rent increases associated with] new leases continue to be lower.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","So, in those two sectors, you’ve got a good story.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","The issue is that we have a large sector called nonhousing service—core nonhousing services,",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","where we don’t see disinflation yet.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","what we see is progress but without any weakening in labor market conditions.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","We’re going to write down new forecasts at the March meeting, and we’ll see at that time.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","I will say that it is gratifying to see the disinflationary process now",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","So you’re right about the data, of course.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","What we did see—we’ve seen average hourly earnings and now the employment cost index abating a little bit still off of their highs of six months ago and more but still at levels that are fairly elevated.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","The job openings number has—in JOLTS, has been quite volatile recently.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","Yeah, I did see that it moved up—back up this morning.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","I do think that it’s probably an important indicator.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","is back up to 1.9 job openings to unemployed people,",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","people who are looking for work.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","So it’s an indicator, but nonetheless, we—you’re right, we do see wages moving down.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","If you look across the rest of the labor market,",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","you still see very high payroll job creation.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","And, you know, quits are still at an elevated level.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","So many, many—by many, many indicators, the job market is still very strong.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","we all wrote down our best estimates of what we thought the ultimate level would be,",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","and that’s obviously back in December.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","And the median for that was between 5 and 5¼ percent.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","At the March meeting, we’re going to update those assessments.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","continue to say that we believe ongoing rate hikes will be appropriate to attain a sufficiently restrictive stance of policy to bring inflation back down to 2 percent.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","We think we’ve covered a lot of ground, and financial conditions have certainly tightened.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","I would say we still think there’s work to do there.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","We haven’t made a decision on exactly where that will be.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","we’re going to be looking carefully at the incoming data between now and the March meeting and then the May meeting.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","I don’t feel a lot of certainty about where that will be.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","It could certainly be higher than we’re writing down right now.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","If we come to the view that we need to write down to,",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","to move rates up beyond what we said in December,",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","we’ll make data-dependent decisions at coming meetings,",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","I guess I would say it this way.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","I continue to think that it’s very difficult to manage the risk of doing too little and finding out in 6 or 12 months that we actually were close but didn’t get the job done.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","Inflation springs back, and we have to go back in.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","And now, you really do worry about expectations getting unanchored and that kind of thing.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","This is a inflation is coming down faster than we expect,",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","then we have tools that would work on that.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","where we have still the highest inflation in 40 years,",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","As I started to mention earlier,",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","we have a sector that represents 56 percent of the core inflation index where we don’t see disinflation yet.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","Inflation in the core services ex.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","housing is still running at 4 percent on a 6- and 12-month basis.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","So there’s not—nothing happening there.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","In the other two sectors representing,",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","now have a story that is credible,",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","although you don’t actually see disinflation yet in housing services,",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","So, for the third sector, we don’t see anything here.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","So I think it would be premature—it would be very premature to declare victory or to think that we’ve really got this.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","We need to see—our goal, of course, is to bring inflation down.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","many factors driving inflation in that sector,",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","and they should be coming into play to have inflation—the disinflationary process begin in that sector.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","But, so far, we don’t see that.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","we see ourselves as having a lot of work left to do.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","So I guess I would say it this way.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","for the first time that the disinflationary process has started.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","And we see it, really, in goods prices so far.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","We—this is what we thought would happen since the very beginning,",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","and now here it is actually happening,",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","and for the reasons we thought.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","We—you know, it’s supply chains, it’s shortages, and it’s demand revolving back towards services.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","But that’s, you know, around a quarter of the PCE price index—core PCE price index.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","So the second sector is housing services, and that’s driven by very different things.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","that measured inflation will continue moving up for several months but will then come down,",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","assuming that [rent increases associated with] new leases continue to be soft.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","So we think that that’s sort of in the pipeline.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","And we actually see disinflation in the goods sector,",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","and we see it in the pipeline for two sectors that amount to a little less than half.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","And we note that when we say inflation is coming down that this is good.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","We expect to see that that disinflation process will be seen,",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","housing—sorry, the core services ex.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","housing sector that I talked about.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","it’s seven or eight different kinds of services,",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","we have a sense of what’s going on in each of those different subsections.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","Probably the biggest part of it,",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","probably 60 percent of that is,",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","research would show is sensitive to slack in the economy and so the labor market will probably be we need to see that it’s the majority of the core PCE index,",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","which is the thing that we think is the best predictor of headline PCE,",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","which is [the price series that we associate with] our mandate.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","So it’s not that we’re not—we’re neither optimistic nor pessimistic.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","We’re just telling you that we don’t see inflation moving down yet in that large sector.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","I think we will fairly soon, but we don’t see it yet.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","we’ve got to be honest with ourselves,",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","but we see ourselves as having perhaps more persistent—we’ll see more persistent inflation in that sector,",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","which will take longer to get down.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","And we’re just going to have to—we have to complete the job.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","You know, that’s what we’re here for.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","we’ve raised rates 4½ percentage points,",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","and we’re talking about a couple of more rate hikes to get to that level we think is appropriately restrictive.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","And why do we think that’s probably necessary?",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","We think, because inflation is still running very hot.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","We’re, of course, taking into account long and variable lags, and we’re thinking about that.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","It really—the story we’re telling about inflation is to ourselves,",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","and the way we understand it is basically the three things that I’ve just gone through a couple of times.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","So I think we’re—you know, we’re living in a world of significant uncertainty.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","I would look across the rate—the spectrum of rates and see that real rates are now positive by— you know,",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","by an appropriate set of measures are positive across the yield curve.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","I think policy is restrictive.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","We’re trying to make a fine judgment about how much is restrictive enough.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","And we’re going to—you know, that’s why we’re slowing down to 25 basis points.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","We’re going to be carefully watching the economy and watching inflation and watching the progress of the disinflationary process.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","We—you know, you’ll see that the minutes will come out in three weeks, and we’ll give you a lot of detail.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","I—you know, we spend a lot of time talking about the path ahead and the state of the economy.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","And I wouldn’t want to start to drive the—describe all the details there, but that was the sense of the discussion, was really talking quite a bit about the path forward.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","So your question is, would we—say your question again.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","So you’re really asking about—you’re asking about prioritization, in effect, is what—",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","So I feel like I have to say this.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","There’s only one way forward here, and that is for Congress to raise the debt ceiling so that the United States government can pay all of its obligations when due.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","And any deviations from that path would be highly risky and that no one should assume that the Fed can protect the economy from the consequences of failing to act in a timely manner.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","In terms of our relationship with the Treasury, we are their fiscal agent.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","And I’m just going to leave it at that.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","I’m just going to leave it at that.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","This is a matter that’s to be resolved between, really—it’s really Congress’ job to raise the debt ceiling.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","And I gather there are discussions happening, but they don’t involve us.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","We’re not involved in those discussions.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","So the Committee obviously did not see this as the time to pause.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","We judged that the appropriate,",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","thing to do at this meeting was to raise the federal funds rate by 25 basis points.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","And we said that we continue to anticipate that ongoing increases in the target range will be appropriate in order to attain that stance of sufficiently restrictive monetary policy that will bring inflation down to 2 percent.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","So that’s the judgment that we made.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","we’re going to write down new forecasts in March,",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","we’ll certainly be looking at the incoming data as everyone else will.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","I think this is not something that the Committee is thinking about or exploring in any kind of detail.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","we used to—the thing we used to do was go every other meeting,",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","and that was considered a fast pace.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","So I think a lot of options are available.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","you saw what the Bank of Canada did and,",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","they left it that they’re willing to raise rates after pausing.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","But this is not something that the Federal Open Market Committee is on the point of deciding right now.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","if—you’re right—if you take very short-term three-month,",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","measures of PCE—core PCE inflation,",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","But that’s because that’s driven by, you know, significantly negative readings from goods inflation.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","Most forecasters would think that the significantly negative readings will be transitory and that goods inflation will move up fairly soon,",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","back up to its longer-run trend of something around zero,",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","So a lot of forecasts would call for core PCE to go back up to 4 percent by the middle of the year,",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","So that’s really where the sustainable level is.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","So that would suggest there’s work left to do.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","let’s say inflation does come down much faster than we expect,",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","As I mentioned, you know, obviously our policy is data dependent.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","We would take that into account.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","And so sectors that represent 55 or 60 percent of that— financial services is a big sector that’s really not driven by labor markets—wages.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","So that’s why I said there are a number of things that will affect—take restaurants,",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","So, clearly, labor is important for restaurants but so are food prices.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","And, you know, transportation services is going to be driven by fuel prices, for example.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","So there are lots of things in that mix that will drive inflation.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","my own view would be that you’re not going to have,",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","a sustainable return to 2 percent inflation in that sector without a better balance in the labor market.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","And I don’t know what that will require in terms of increased unemployment, your question.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","I do think there are a number of dimensions through which the labor market can soften.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","we have inflation moving down without the softening in the labor market.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","I think most forecasters would say that unemployment will probably rise a bit from here.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","But I still think—I continue to think that there’s a path to getting inflation back down to 2 percent without a really significant economic decline or a significant increase in unemployment.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","And that’s because the—you know, the setting we’re in is quite different.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","The inflation that we originally got was very much a collision between very strong demand and hard supply constraints,",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","not something that you really have seen in prior— you know,",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","And so now we see goods inflation coming down for the reasons we thought,",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","and we understand why housing inflation will come down.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","And I think will—a story will emerge on the nonhousing services sector soon enough.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","But I think there is— there’s ongoing disinflation,",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","and we don’t yet see weakening in the labor market.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","So I do think you—most forecasts and,",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","my own assessment would be that that growth will continue—positive growth will continue but at a subdued pace as it did last year.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","We had growth of—GDP growth of 1 percent last year and also final sales growth,",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","which we think is a better indicator,",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","most forecasts and certainly my assessment would be that growth will continue at a fairly subdued level this year.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","There are other factors, though, that need to be considered.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","You will come down, sentiment will improve.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","You also—state and local governments are really flush these days with,",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","and many of them are considering tax cuts or even sending checks.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","So I think that’s going to support—they’re also spending a lot.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","There’s a lot of spending coming in the construction pipeline, both private and public.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","And so that’s going to support economic activity.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","So I think there’s a good chance that those factors will help support positive growth this year.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","And that’s my base case, is that there will be positive growth this year.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","going to be a light switch flipped or anything like that.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","I think it’s just an accumulating—accumulation of evidence.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","we’ll be looking—by the time of the March meeting,",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","we’ll have two more employment reports,",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","and we’ll be looking at those carefully as all of us will.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","And we’ll be asking ourselves, what are they telling us?",""

"2023-02-01","Q&A","It’s—you know, it shows wages coming down but still at a high level.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","They’re still at a level that’s way above—well above where they were before the pandemic.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","So I don’t want to put a number on it in terms of months,",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","but as the accumulated evidence comes in,",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","it’s going to be reflected in our assessment of the outlook,",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","and that will be reflected in our policy over time.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","it is our job to restore price stability and achieve 2 percent inflation for the benefit of the American public.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","We’re not—market participants have a very different job.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","In fact, I did that job for years but in one form or another.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","But, you know, we have to deliver that.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","And so we are strongly resolved that we will,",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","complete this task because we think it has benefits that will,",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","support economic activity and benefit the public for many,",""

"2023-02-01","Q&A","expected goods inflation to start coming down by the end of 2021,",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","and it didn’t come down all through ’22.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","And now it’s coming down, and it’s come down pretty fast.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","So I would say these are—this is not a standard business cycle where you can look at the last 10 times there was a just harder to forecast inflation.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","It may take longer to come down.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","our job is to deliver inflation back to target,",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","But I think we’re going to be cautious about declaring victory and,",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","sending signals that we think that the game is won because,",""

"2023-02-01","Q&A","It’s just—it’s the early stages of disinflation.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","And it’s most welcome to be able to say that we are now in disinflation,",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","But we just see that it has to spread through the economy and that it’s going to take some time.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","my forecast and that of my colleagues as you will see from the SEP and—I mean,",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","there are many different forecasts,",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","it’s a forecast of slower growth,",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","some softening in labor market conditions,",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","and inflation moving down steadily but not quickly.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","if the economy performs broadly in line with those expectations,",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","it will not be appropriate to cut rates this year,",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","other people have forecasts with inflation coming down much faster,",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","if that happens—inflation comes down much faster,",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","and it will be incorporated into our thinking about policy.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","I’m not particularly concerned about the divergence,",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","because it is largely due to the market’s expectation that inflation will move down more quickly.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","I think that’s the bigger part of that.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","our forecasts— different participants have different forecasts,",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","those forecasts are for continued subdued growth,",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","some softening in the labor market but not a recession,",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","And we have inflation moving down,",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","into the—somewhere in the mid-threes or maybe lower than that this year.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","We’ll update that in March, but that’s what we thought in December.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","They show inflation coming down, in some cases, much quicker than that.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","And we have a different view and—a different view, it’s a different forecast, really.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","I just—I don’t see us cutting rates this year if we get—if our outlook turns true,",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","If we do see inflation coming down much more quickly,",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","that’ll play into our policy setting,",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","That’s the general sense of it.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","Look, we understand—I personally understand well that COVID is still out there, but that it’s no longer playing an important role in our economy.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","And, you know, we’ve kept that statement in there for quite a while, and I think we just—we knew we would take it out at some point.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","There’s never a perfect time, but we know, postmeeting statement as an ongoing economic risk as opposed to, you know, a health issue.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","That means that, effectively, in people’s decisionmaking, inflation has become a really salient issue.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","And once that happens— that’s what we can’t allow to happen.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","so that’s why we worry that the longer we’re at this and the longer people are talking about inflation all day long,",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","the more risk of something like that.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","But no, there’s not much—it’s more of a risk.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","It always has been more of a risk than anything else.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","By the way, I think it’s becoming less salient.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","And people are—you know, we pick that up in conversations.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","gradually—they’re glad that inflation is coming down.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","People really don’t like inflation.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","that could also add a boost to economic activity.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","You look at the sentiment surveys now,",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","very low with 3½ percent unemployment and,",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","high wage increases nominally by historical standards.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","It has to be inflation, right?",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","So I think once inflation is seen to be coming down in coming months,",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","even you will also see a boost to sentiment,",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","is consumers and businesses that,",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","we believe that expectations of future inflation are a very important part of the process of creating inflation.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","That’s a sort of bedrock belief.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","In one way or another, it has to be.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","the risk eight months ago or so,",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","longer-term inflation expectations had moved up.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","We moved quite vigorously last year.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","Expectations are—seem to be well anchored,",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","including at the shorter end now,",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","So it’s, you know—and that’s—I think that’s very reassuring.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","that inflation is going to come back down to 2 percent and it’s just a matter of us following through.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","That's immeasurably helpful to the process of getting inflation down.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","The fact that people now do generally believe that it will come down,",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","that’ll be part of the process of getting it down.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","And it’s a very positive thing.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","It’s something that we monitor carefully.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","Financial conditions didn’t really change much from the December meeting to now.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","They couple times here, there’s a difference in perspective by some market measures on how fast inflation will come down.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","We’re just going to have to see.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","I mean, I’m not going to try to persuade people to have a different forecast, but our forecast is that it will take some time and some patience and that we’ll need to keep rates higher for longer.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","Look, I—it’s very hard to think about all the different possible ramifications.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","I don’t think there’s likely to be any important interaction between the two,",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","because I believe Congress will wind up acting,",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","to raise the debt ceiling in a way that doesn’t risk,",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","the progress we’re making against inflation and the economy and the financial sector.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","I believe that that will happen.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","will monitor money market conditions carefully as—you know,",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","the Treasury General Account will shrink down,",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","and then it will grow back up.",""
"2023-02-01","Q&A","And we understand there’ll be lots of flows between there and the overnight repo facility and reserves.",""
"2023-03-22","Opening Statement","Before discussing today’s meeting, let me briefly address recent developments in the banking sector.",""
"2023-03-22","Opening Statement","In the past two weeks, serious difficulties at a small number of banks have emerged.",""
"2023-03-22","Opening Statement","History has shown that isolated banking problems,",""
"2023-03-22","Opening Statement","can undermine confidence in healthy banks and threaten the ability of the banking system as a whole to play its vital role in supporting the savings and credit needs of households and businesses.",""
"2023-03-22","Opening Statement","That is why, in response to these events, the Federal Reserve, working with the Treasury Department and the FDIC, took decisive actions to protect the",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","So I, I guess our view is that the banking system is sound and it’s resilient—it’s got strong capital [and] liquidity.",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","We took powerful actions with [the] Treasury and the FDIC, which demonstrate that all depositors’ savings are safe and that the banking system is safe.",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","Deposit flows in the banking system have stabilized over the last week.",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","And the last thing I’ll say is that we’ve undertaken—we’re undertaking a thorough internal review that will identify where we can strengthen supervision and regulation.",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","So we considered—we did consider that in the days running up to the meeting,",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","and you see the decision that we made,",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","which I’ll say a couple things about.",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","it was supported by a very strong consensus,",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","and I’ll be happy to explain why.",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","it is that the intermeeting data on inflation and the labor market came in stronger than expected and,",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","we were clearly on track to continue with ongoing rate hikes.",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","it looked like we’d need to raise rates over the course of the that the public has confidence that we will do so—that we’ll bring inflation down to 2 percent over time.",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","It is important that we sustain that confidence with our actions as well as our words.",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","that the events of the last two weeks are likely to result in some tightening credit conditions for households and businesses and thereby weigh on demand,",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","Such a tightening in financial conditions would work in the same direction as rate tightening.",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","you can think of it as being the equivalent of a rate hike or perhaps more than that;",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","it’s not possible to make that assessment today with any precision whatsoever.",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","So our decision was to move ahead with the 25 basis point hike and to change our guidance,",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","some additional hikes maybe—some policy firming may be appropriate.",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","we’ll be focused as always on the incoming data and the evolving outlook and,",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","on our assessment of the actual and expected effects of credit tightening.",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","No, I think it’s, it’s meant to refer to our policy rate.",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","on the words “may” and “some,” as opposed to “ongoing.” Ongoing.",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","we clearly were—what we were doing there was taking onboard the—trying to reflect the uncertainty about what will happen.",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","it’s possible that this will turn out to have very might look different.",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","It’s also possible that this potential tightening will contribute significant tightening in credit conditions over time and,",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","if that—that means that monetary policy may have less work to do.",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","I mean, with our monetary policy, we’re, we’re really focused on macroeconomic outcomes.",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","In particular, we’re focused on, on this potential credit tightening and what can that produce in the way of tighter credit conditions.",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","I think when we think about the situation with the banks, we’re focused on our—on our financial stability tools, in particular our lending facilities, the debt—sorry, the discount window, and also the new facility.",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","we have just come from an FOMC meeting and,",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","the people who write the minutes will be very carefully counting,",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","but I’ll tell you what I heard.",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","What I heard was significant number of people saying that they anticipated there would turn out not to be the case,",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","in principle you would need more rate hikes.",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","So some people did reflect that in their FOMC—in their SEP forecasts.",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","I think there may also just have been— remember, this is 12 days ago.",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","we’re trying to assess something that just is so recent and it’s people—you know,",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","So December was a good place to start,",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","and we wound up with—we wound up with very similar outcomes for December.",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","the early—the data in the first part—the first five weeks of the intermeeting period pointed to stronger inflation and stronger labor markets.",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","So that pointed to higher rates.",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","this latter part kind of—the possibility of credit conditions tightening really,",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","we know that we have other,",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","we think our monetary policy tool works,",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","many banks—our rate hikes were well telegraphed to the market,",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","and many banks have managed to handle them.",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","The issue was really not about those specific banks, but about the risk of a contagion to, to other banks and to the financial markets more broadly.",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","So Vice Chair Barr is, is of course leading that review.",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","And he’s responsible for it in his capacity as Vice Chair for Supervision.",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","that there was going to be a need for review.",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","the question we’re all asking ourselves over that first weekend was,",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","he was obviously going to lead it in his capacity.",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","So I don’t—my role was to announce it,",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","So it’s really just a question of not knowing at this point.",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","There’s a great deal of literature on the connection between tighter credit conditions, economic activity, hiring, and inflation.",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","Very large body of literature.",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","The question is, how significant will this credit tightening be and how sustainable it will be?",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","And we don’t really see it yet, so, so people are making estimates, you know, people are publishing estimates, but it’s very kind of rule-of-thumb guesswork almost at this point.",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","But we think it’s, it’s potentially",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","and then I’ll come to the questions around supervision.",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","Silicon Valley Bank management failed badly—they grew the bank very quickly,",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","they exposed the bank to significant liquidity risk and interest rate risk,",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","We now know that supervisors saw these risks and, and intervened.",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","We know that the public saw all this.",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","We know that SVB experienced an unprecedentedly rapid and massive bank run.",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","So this is a—this is a very large group of connected depositors—concentrated group of connected depositors in a very,",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","faster than historical record would suggest.",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","So as for us—so for our part, we’re doing a review of supervision and regulation.",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","My only interest is that we identify what went wrong here.",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","How did this happen is the question.",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","And then make an assessment of what are the right policies to put in place so that it doesn’t happen again,",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","and then implement those policies.",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","It would be inappropriate for me at this stage to offer my views on what the answers might be.",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","You know, I simply can’t do that.",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","Vice Chair Barr is clear—really to your last question—it’s clear that we do need to strengthen supervision and regulation.",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","I assume that there will be recommendations coming out of the report,",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","I plan on supporting them and supporting their implementation.",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","These are not weaknesses that are—that are at all broadly through the banking system.",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","This was—this was a bank that was an outlier in terms of both its percentage of, of uninsured deposits and in terms of its holdings of duration risk.",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","And again, supervisors did get in there, and, and they were, as you know, obviously, you know they were— they were on this issue, but nonetheless, this, this still happened.",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","And so that’s really the nature of the interview—sorry, of the review—is to discover that.",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","So we published an SEP today,",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","as you will have seen,",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","and it shows that basically participants expect relatively slow growth,",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","a gradual rebalancing of supply and always,",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","the path of the economy is uncertain,",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","and policy is going to reflect what actually happens rather than what we write down in the",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","we’re looking—for purposes of our monetary policy tool,",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","we’re looking at what’s happening among the banks and asking,",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","is there going to be some tightening in credit conditions?",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","And then we’re thinking about that as effectively doing the same thing that rate hikes do.",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","So, in a way, that substitutes for rate hikes.",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","we have to have—policy has got to be tight enough to bring inflation down to 2 percent over time.",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","It doesn’t all have to come from rate hikes:",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","we—it’s highly uncertain how long the situation will be sustained or how significant any of those effects would be,",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","so we’re just going to have to watch.",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","we will do enough to bring inflation down to 2 percent.",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","So, you know, we’re well aware of the concentrations people have in commercial real estate.",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","I really don’t think it’s comparable to this.",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","The, the banking system is, is strong, it is sound, it is resilient, it’s well capitalized, and I really don’t see that as at all analogous to this.",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","I welcome—it’s 100 percent certainty that there will be independent investigations and outside investigations and all that.",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","So we welcome—when a bank fails, there are investigations.",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","And, of course, we welcome that.",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","We don’t give advice to the fiscal authorities, and we assume that—we take fiscal policy as, as it comes to our front door, stick it in our model along with a million other things.",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","We have responsibility for price stability.",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","The Federal Reserve has responsibility for that.",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","And nothing’s going to change that.",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","So—and we will get inflation down to 2 percent in time.",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","You have to look at,",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","at the impulse from spending because spending was,",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","tremendously high during the pandemic,",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","as the pandemic programs rolled off,",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","so the—this sort of fiscal impulse is actually not what’s driving inflation right now.",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","It was—it was at the beginning perhaps part of what was driving inflation, but that’s not really the story now.",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","So 13(3) seemed like the right—we have a little more flexibility under section 13(3).",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","We’ve done quite a lot under the discount window as well.",""

"2023-03-22","Q&A","No, we, if we need to raise hike—raise rates higher, we will.",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","an effect on the macroeconomy,",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","and we’re—we’re going to be watching to see what that is.",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","And we’ll also be watching what’s happening with inflation and in the labor market.",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","So we’ll be watching all those things,",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","and of course we will—we will eventually get to [a] tight enough policy to bring inflation down to 2 percent.",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","We’ll find ourselves at that place.",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","So—People think of QE and QT in different ways,",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","so let me be clear about how I’m thinking about these recent developments.",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","So the recent liquidity provision that has increased the size of our balance sheet but the intent and the effects of it are very different from what we—from when we expand our balance sheet through purchases of longer-term securities.",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","Large-scale purchases of long-term securities are,",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","are really meant to alter the stance of policy by pushing down—pushing up the price and down the rates,",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","which supports demand through channels we understand fairly well.",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","The balance sheet expansion is really temporary lending to banks to meet those special liquidity demands created by the recent tensions;",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","it’s not intended to directly alter the stance of monetary policy.",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","We do believe that it’s working.",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","It’s having its intended effect of bolstering confidence in the banking system and thereby forestalling what might otherwise have been an abrupt and outsized tightening in financial conditions.",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","In terms of the distribution of reserves,",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","as running into reserve shortages.",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","we think that our program of allowing our balance sheet to,",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","predicatbly and passively is working.",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","And of course we’re, we’re always prepared to, to change that if that changes.",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","But we don’t see any evidence that that’s changed.",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","I mean, to be honest, I don’t—I don’t recall the specifics of that.",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","It’s been quite an interesting seven weeks.",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","that we have—there have been presentations about,",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","I mean, it’s been in all the newspapers.",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","It’s not a surprise that there are institutions that have—that have had unhedged long positions in long- duration securities that have lost value as,",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","as longer-term rates have gone up due to our rate increases.",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","So that’s, that’s not a surprise.",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","as is now in the public record,",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","the supervisory team was apparently engaged,",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","very much engaged with the bank repeatedly,",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","And so that’s really the purpose of—one way to think about the review that Vice Chair Barr is conducting is to try to understand how that happened and try to understand how we can do better and what policies we need to change.",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","one thing is the speed of the—I’ll come back to that,",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","it’s very different from what we’ve seen in the past,",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","and it does kind of suggest that there’s a need for possible,",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","regulatory and supervisory changes just because supervision and regulation need to keep up with what’s,",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","what’s happening in the world.",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","I will have to come back to you on that.",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","Well, I’m not saying anything more than I’m saying.",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","So—but what I’m saying is you’ve seen that we have the tools to protect depositors when there’s a threat of serious harm to the economy or to—or to the financial system, and we’re prepared to use those tools.",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","And I think depositors should assume that their—that their deposits are safe.",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","we—that was really the Swiss government that we of course were,",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","were following it over the course of the weekend,",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","and we were engaged with their authorities in the way that you would expect,",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","all the ways that you would expect.",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","It seems to have been a positive outcome in the sense that the transaction was agreed to,",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","and it has been— the markets have accepted it,",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","and it seems to have gone well,",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","and I think there was a concern that it might not go well.",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","So coming into the middle of this week,",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","I would say that that is going well so far.",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","So that’s just—that’s an estimate of what will happen as demand slows and as conditions soften in the labor market and it’s just—it’s a highly uncertain estimate.",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","And, I mean, I was really—we have to bring inflation down to 2 percent.",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","The costs of bringing it down—there are real costs to bringing it down to 2 percent,",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","but the costs of failing are much higher.",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","you can see that if the central bank doesn’t get inflation back in place,",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","get inflation—make sure that inflation expectations remain anchored,",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","you can have a long series of years where inflation is high and volatile,",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","and it’s hard to invest capital,",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","it’s hard for an economy to perform well.",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","And we’re looking to avoid that and,",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","to get back to where we need to be—back to where we were for a quarter century,",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","and get there as quickly as we can.",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","it depends on whether you—so recessions tend to be nonlinear,",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","and so they’re very hard to model.",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","the models all work in a kind of linear way—if you have more of this,",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","the reactions tend to be nonlinear and that’s what—so we don’t know whether that’ll happen this time.",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","we don’t know how significant it will be,",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","we’re very focused on getting inflation down because we know in the longer run that that is the thing that will most benefit the people we serve.",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","That’s how we can have a long—you know,",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","we’ve had very strong the reason was inflation wasn’t forcing the central bank to come in and stop an incipient or,",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","very long expansions without high inflation,",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","and they’re very good for people.",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","You see late in an expansion—you see low unemployment,",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","you see the benefits of wages going to people at the lower end of the wage spectrum.",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","It’s just a place that we should try to get back to.",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","whether these events have had much of an effect.",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","It’s hard for me to see how they would have helped the possibility—but I guess I would just say,",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","it’s too early to say whether there really have been changes in that.",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","You know, the question will be how long this period is sustained.",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","then the greater will be the likely declines in—or tightening in credit standards,",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","I do still think, though, that there’s a—there’s a pathway to that.",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","I think that pathway still exists and, you know, we’re certainly trying to find it.",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","That is a great question and is right in the heart of what the review will be doing under Vice Chair Barr’s leadership.",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","So that’s, I think that’s where—that’s what you think about.",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","What can we do to make sure that—but, again, that’s not for me to answer today.",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","I wouldn’t share them because I,",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","I want nothing other than us to find out what happened and why,",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","figure out what we can do to do better,",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","and then implement those changes.",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","It’s—For me to be giving you my half-formed,",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","There’s a real serious review going on with,",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","with people from all over the Federal Reserve System who are not connected to this,",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","and I’m confident that it will produce a satisfactory result.",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","So we haven’t really talked about changing the balance sheet implementation—that’s not something we’ve discussed yet.",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","As I mentioned, we’re always willing to change that if we conclude that it’s appropriate, but we’re really not seeing any signs there.",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","Sorry, then the question before that was, just give me a—",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","So financial conditions seem to have tightened—and probably by more than the traditional indexes say,",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","because traditional indexes are focused a lot on [interest] rates and [prices of] equities,",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","and they don’t necessarily capture lending conditions.",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","So there are other measures which,",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","you know—bank lending conditions and things like that—they show some more tightening.",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","how significant will that be and how,",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","you know—what will be the extent of it and what will be the duration of it?",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","once you have—once you know that,",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","there’s a fair amount of research about how that,",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","with broad uncertainty bands—how that works its way into the economy [and] over what period of time.",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","we’ll be looking to see the first part of that—like how serious is this,",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","and does it look like it’s going to be sustained,",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","it could easily have a significant macroeconomic effect,",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","and we would factor that into our policy decisions.",""
"2023-03-22","Q&A","rate cuts are not in our base case,",""
"2023-05-03","Opening Statement","Before discussing today’s meeting, let me comment briefly on recent developments in the banking sector.",""
"2023-05-03","Opening Statement","Conditions in that sector have broadly improved since early March,",""
"2023-05-03","Opening Statement","and the U.S banking system is sound and resilient.",""
"2023-05-03","Opening Statement","We will continue to monitor conditions in the sector.",""
"2023-05-03","Opening Statement","We are committed to learning the right lessons from this episode and will work to prevent events like these from happening again.",""
"2023-05-03","Opening Statement","As a first step in that process,",""
"2023-05-03","Opening Statement","last week we released Vice Chair for Supervision Barr’s Review of the Federal Reserve’s Supervision and Regulation of Silicon Valley Bank.",""
"2023-05-03","Opening Statement","The review’s findings underscore the need to address our rules and supervisory practices to make for a stronger and more resilient banking system,",""
"2023-05-03","Opening Statement","and I am confident that we will do so.",""
"2023-05-03","Opening Statement","From the perspective of monetary policy,",""
"2023-05-03","Opening Statement","our focus remains squarely on our dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people.",""
"2023-05-03","Opening Statement","My colleagues and I understand the hardship that high inflation is causing,",""
"2023-05-03","Opening Statement","and we remain strongly committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal.",""
"2023-05-03","Opening Statement","Price stability is the responsibility of the Federal Reserve.",""
"2023-05-03","Opening Statement","Without price stability, the economy does not work for anyone.",""
"2023-05-03","Opening Statement","we will not achieve a sustained period of strong labor market conditions that benefit all.",""
"2023-05-03","Opening Statement","Today, the FOMC raised its policy interest rate by ¼ percentage point.",""
"2023-05-03","Opening Statement","we have raised interest rates by a total of 5 percentage points in order to attain a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2 percent over time.",""
"2023-05-03","Opening Statement","We are also continuing to reduce our securities holdings.",""
"2023-05-03","Opening Statement","we will take a data-dependent approach in determining the extent to which additional policy firming may be appropriate.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","today our decision was to raise the federal funds rate by 25 basis points.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","A, a decision on a pause was not made today.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","You will have noticed that in the—in the statement from March,",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","we had a sentence that said the Committee anticipates that some additional policy firming may be appropriate.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","That sentence is, is not in, in the statement anymore.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","and instead we’re saying that,",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","in that’s a meaningful change that we’re no longer saying that we anticipate.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","And so we’ll be driven by incoming data meeting by meeting.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","And, you know, we’ll approach that question at the June meeting.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","So the—the staff’s forecast is—so let me say—start by saying that that’s not my own most likely case,",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","that the economy will continue to grow at,",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","And I think that’s—so different people on the Committee have different forecasts.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","That’s, that’s my own assessment of the most likely path.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","[The] staff produces its own forecast,",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","and it’s independent of the forecasts of,",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","which include the Governors and the Reserve Bank presidents,",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","And we think this is a healthy thing— that the,",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","the staff is writing down what they really think.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","They’re not especially influenced by what the Governors think, and vice versa.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","The Governors are not taking what the staff says and just writing that down.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","So it’s actually good that the, the staff and individual participants can have different perspectives.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","the forecast was for a mild recession,",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","and by that I would characterize as one in which the rise in unemployment is smaller than is—has been typical in modern-era recessions.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","I wouldn’t want to characterize the staff’s forecast for this meeting.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","We’ll, we’ll leave that to the minutes—but broadly, broadly similar to that.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","It was—of course, it’s something that came up.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","We talk a lot about risks to the—to the outlook, and that will—that come up.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","A number of people did raise that as a risk to the outlook.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","I wouldn’t say that it was important in today’s monetary policy decision.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","So the February 14 presentation—I didn’t remember it very well.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","But now, of course, I’ve gone back and looked at it very carefully.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","And what it was was a general presentation.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","It was an informational briefing of the whole Board— the entire Board.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","I think all members were there.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","And it was about interest rate risk in the banks and, and lots of data.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","And there was one page on Silicon Valley Bank,",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","the amount of losses they—or mark-to-market losses they had in their portfolio.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","There was nothing in it about—that I recall,",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","So it was—I think the takeaway was,",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","they were going away to do a—an assessment,",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","It wasn’t—it, it wasn’t presented as an urgent or alarming situation.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","It was presented as a—as an informational, nondecisional kind of a thing.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","And I thought it was a good presentation and,",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","In terms of what we’re doing—of course,",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","are attending to liquidity and taking opportunity now,",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","And you asked about the separation principle.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","I— you know, like so many things, it, it’s very useful.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","But, you know, ultimately, it has its limits.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","I think in this particular case,",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","we have found that the monetary policy tools and the financial stability tools are not in conflict.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","They’re both—they’re working well together.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","We’ve used our, our financial stability tools to support banks through our lending facilities.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","Well, I mean, I didn’t say it wasn’t alarming.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","It was—they’re pointing out something that they’re working on and that they’re on the case—that, that, you know, that—I’m not sure whether they mentioned—I think they did, actually.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","They mentioned that they had taken regulatory action matter—or supervisory action in the form of matters requiring attention.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","So I think that was also in the presentation.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","I think it was to say: Yes, this is a bank, and there are many other banks that are experiencing this—these things, and we’re on the case.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","So I, you know, we certainly don’t—and I don’t have an agenda to further consolidate banks.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","There’s been—consolidation has been a factor in the",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","So I, I think it’s probably good policy that we, we don’t want the largest banks doing big acquisitions.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","And—but this is—this is an exception for a failing bank.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","And I, I think it’s actually a good outcome for the banking system.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","It also would have—would have been a good—a good outcome for the banking system had one of the regional banks bought, bought this company.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","And that could have been the outcome.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","But, ultimately, we have to follow the law in our agencies, and the law is, it goes to the, the least-cost bid.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","I think—I think I follow that up by saying,",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","it’s quite impossible to have a precise estimate of the words to that effect.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","But, in principle, that’s the idea.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","when we—we’ve been raising interest rates,",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","and that raises the price of credit,",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","restricts credit in the economy,",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","working through the price mechanism.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","when banks raise their credit standards,",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","that can also make credit tighter in a kind of broadly similar way.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","It isn’t—it isn’t possible to make a kind of clean translation between one and the other,",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","although firms are trying that and,",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","we have to be—we have to be honest and humble about our ability to make a precise assessment.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","So it does complicate the task of achieving, you know, a sufficiently restrictive stance.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","we won’t have to raise the rates quite as high as we would have had this not happened.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","The extent of that is so hard to predict because we don’t know how persistent these,",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","We don’t know how large they’ll be and how long they’ll take to be transmitted.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","But that’s, that’s what we’ll be watching carefully to find out.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","It’s that—this is just something that we have to factor in as we—as we want to find ourselves.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","So I guess I would say it this way:",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","of the extent to which additional policy firming may be appropriate is going to be an ongoing one,",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","and we’re going to be looking at the factors that I mentioned that—they’re listed in,",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","in understanding of monetary policy.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","Credit tightening is a different thing.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","There’s a lot of literature on that.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","But translating it into, into rate hikes is uncertain, let’s say—it adds even further uncertainty.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","Nonetheless, we’ll be able to see what’s happening with credit conditions— what’s happening with lending.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","We get—there’s a lot of data on that.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","And, you know, we’ll, we’ll factor that into our decisionmaking.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","That’s going to be an ongoing assessment.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","We’re going to need data to accumulate on that—not an assessment that we’ve made,",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","that would mean we think we’ve reached that point.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","And I just think it’s, it’s not possible to say that with confidence now.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","you will know that the Summary of Economic Projections from the March meeting showed that in—at that point in time,",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","that the median participant thought that this was— this was the appropriate level of the—of the ultimate high level of rates.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","We’ll revisit that at the June meeting.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","we’re just going to have to— before we really declare that,",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","I think we’re going to have to see data accumulating and,",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","So we’re going to release the results of this SLOOS on May 8,",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","in line with our usual time frame.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","And I would just say that the SLOOS is broadly consistent,",""

"2023-05-03","Q&A","Banking data will show that lending has continued to grow,",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","but the pace has been slowing really since the second half of last year.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","we—the reason is that we—again,",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","with our monetary policy we’re try—trying to reach and then—and then stay at a,",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","a level of policy—a policy stance that’s sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation down to 2 percent over time.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","And, you know, that’s what we’re trying to do with our—with our tool.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","I think slowing down was the right move.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","I think it’s enabled us to see more data,",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","and it will continue to do maybe slowing down economic activity too much.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","And we thought that this rate hike,",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","along with the meaningful change in,",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","was the right way to balance that.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","I would just say that this assessment will be an ongoing one.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","you’ve seen—take inflation for a minute.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","We’ve seen inflation come down—move back up two or three times since March of 2021.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","We’ve seen inflation have a few months of coming down and then come right back up.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","So I think you’re going to want to see that—you know,",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","that a few months of data will,",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","will persuade you that you’ve—that you’ve got this right,",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","And, you know, we, we have the luxury: We’ve raised 500 basis points.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","I think real rates are probably—that you can calculate them many different ways.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","But one way is to look at the nominal rate and then subtract a,",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","So you’ve got 2 percent real rates.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","That’s meaningfully above what most people would—many people,",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","And you see that in interest— interest-sensitive activities.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","And you also begin to see it more and more in, in other activities.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","And if you—if you put the—you put the credit tightening on top of that and the QT that’s,",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","Look—I think we’re always going to have 2 percent as our, our target.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","We’re always going to be focusing on getting there.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","You know, it’s—let me just say, that’s not what we’re looking for.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","We’re looking for inflation going down to 2 percent over time.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","that’s not a question that’s in front of us,",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","and it would depend on so many other things.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","But, ultimately, we’re not looking to get to 3 percent and then drop our tools.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","We have a, a goal of getting to 2 percent.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","We think it’s going to take some time.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","We don’t think it’ll be a smooth process.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","I think we’re going to—we’re going to need to stay at this for a while.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","I think they, they—you know, they, they will both matter equally at that point.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","Right now, you have a labor market that’s still extraordinarily tight.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","You still got 1.6 job openings,",""

"2023-05-03","Q&A","We do see some evidence of softening in labor market conditions.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","But, overall, you’re near a 50-year low in unemployment.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","Wages—you all will have seen that the wage number from late see some softening;",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","we see new labor supply coming in.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","These are very positive developments.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","running high—well above our—well above our goal.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","And right now, we need to be focusing on bringing inflation down.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","Fortunately, we’ve been able to do that so far without unemployment going up.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","I know what’s printed in the Summary of Economic Projections and all that.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","I don’t think you can deduce exactly what you said about what participants think,",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","because you don’t know what they were thinking for first- quarter GDP at that point.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","They could have been thinking about a fairly low number.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","I continue to think that it’s possible that this time is really different.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","And the reason is, there’s just so much excess demand, really, in the labor market.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","we’ve raised rates by 5 percentage points in 14 months,",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","and the unemployment rate is 3½ percent,",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","pretty much where it was—even lower than where it was when we started.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","So job openings are still very, very high.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","We see—by surveys and much, the—as they’ve declined without unemployment going up.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","So we—there are no promises in this.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","that it’s possible that we can continue to have a cooling in the labor market without having the big increases in unemployment that have gone with many,",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","Now, that would be against history.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","That would be against the, the pattern.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","But I do think that it—that this,",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","that the situation in the labor market,",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","wages are actually—wages have been moving down.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","Wage increases have been moving down,",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","and that’s a good sign—down to a more sustainable level.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","So I think that—I think it’s still possible.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","more likely than that of having,",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","But it’s not—it’s not that the case of having a recession is—I don’t rule that out,",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","It’s, it’s possible that we will have what I hope would be a mild recession.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","So we look at a range of wage, wage measures.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","And then—so you assume wages should be equal to productivity increases plus inflation.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","And so you can—you can look at,",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","at what the—what they would have to run at over a long period of time for that to be consistent with 2 percent inflation.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","They can recession—sorry, later in an expansion.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","and you have to take the precision with a degree of—a degree of salt.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","But I would say that what they will show is that,",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","if the—if wages are running at 5 percent,",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","3 percent is closer to where they need to be.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","Wage increases and closer to 3 percent,",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","is what it would take to get—to be consistent with inflation over a longer period of time.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","I don’t want to—I do not think that wages are the principal driver of inflation.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","You’re asking me a very specific question.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","I think there are many things.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","I think wages and prices tend to move together.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","And it’s very hard to say what’s causing what.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","that—that wages are really the principal driver,",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","because I don’t think that’s really right.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","So higher profits and higher margins are what happens when you have an imbalance between supply and demand:",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","And we’ve been in a situation in many parts of the economy where,",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","where supply has been fixed or,",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","And so, you know, the way the market clears is through higher prices.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","I think—as goods pipelines have,",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","back to normal so that we full competition,",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","where there’s enough supply to meet demand.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","And then it’s—then it’s, then you’re really back to full competition.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","That’s—that would be the dynamic I would expect.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","I mean, we look at a combination of data and, and forecasts.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","the whole idea is to—is to create a good forecast based on what you see in the data.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","So we’re always, always looking at both.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","You know, and it will—of course, it’ll be the obvious things.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","It’ll be readings on inflation.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","I think a particular focus for us going—now,",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","seven weeks now and going forward is going to be,",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","what’s happening with credit tightening?",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","Are small and medium-sized banks tightening credit standards,",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","and is that having an effect on,",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","so we can begin to assess how that fits in with monetary policy.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","That’ll, that’ll be an important thing.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","I just—you know, we’ll be looking at everything.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","It’s— perhaps a little bit more, due to what’s happened.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","And we have to factor all of that in and,",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","and make our assessment of—you know,",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","of whether our policy stance is sufficiently restrictive.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","And we have to do that in a world where policy works with long and variable lags.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","But, you know, we, we will make our best assessment, and that’s what we think.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","So we on the Committee have a—have a view that inflation is going to come down—not so quickly,",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","if that forecast is broadly right,",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","it would not be appropriate and—to cut rates,",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","If you have a different forecast and,",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","quite rapid reductions in inflation,",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","the history of the last two years has been very much that inflation moves down.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","Particularly now, if you look at nonhousing services, it really, really hasn’t moved much.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","so we think we’ll have to—demand will have to weaken a little bit,",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","conditions may have to soften a bit more to begin to see progress there.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","it wouldn’t be—it wouldn’t be appropriate for us to cut rates.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","So we looked at that very carefully, as you would imagine.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","And, you know, the—it’s, it’s really not contributing, we don’t think, now.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","It hasn’t actually been growing.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","You know, it moved up—moved down and then moved back up to where it was.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","when there were the big deposit flows,",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","have really stabilized now—what happened was,",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","institutional investors took their uninsured deposits and put them in government money market funds,",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","which bought paper from the Federal Home Loan Banks and things like that.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","retail investors had been gradual—as they do in every tightening cycle,",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","they’ve been gradually moving their deposits into higher-yielding places such as CDs and,",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","So that’s a gradual process that is quite natural and happens during a,",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","was the institutional investors moving their uninsured deposits and spreading them around and things like that.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","But it doesn’t seem to have had any—any effect overall on the overnight repo facility.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","to help us keep rates where they’re supposed to be,",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","it’s serving that purpose very well.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","I would just say, it’s —I, I don’t really think we should be— we shouldn’t even be talking about a world in which the",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","I didn’t—I didn’t take part in creating the report or doing the work,",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","not a very large bank—a large bank failed quite suddenly and unexpectedly in a way that threatened to spread contagion into the financial system.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","that I’m really focused on is to understand what went wrong,",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","and identify what we need to do to address that.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","Some of that is—may, it may just have been technology evolving.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","You know, we have to keep up with all that.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","But some of it may be our policies, and—supervisory and regulatory, whatever.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","What our job is now is, identify those things and implement them.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","And that’s kind of the only thing I care about is—and I think—I feel like I am accountable for doing everything I can to make sure that that happens.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","So I guess I would—I guess I would say it this way.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","from the very beginning that were at the heart of the stress that we— that we saw in early March,",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","Those have now all been resolved, and all the depositors have been protected.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","I think that the resolution and sale of,",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","of First Republic kind of draws a line under that period of—is an important step toward drawing a line under that period of,",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","I also think we are very focused on what’s happening with credit availability,",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","with what you saw in the—in the Beige Book,",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","and you will see in the SLOOS,",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","small and medium-sized banks who are feeling that they need to tighten credit standards—build liquidity.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","What’s going to be the macroeconomic effect of that?",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","we will continue to very carefully monitor what’s going on in the banking system,",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","and we’ll factor that assessment into our decisions in an important way,",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","So let me say, first of all, I’ve been Chair of the Board for five-plus years now, and I fully recognize that we made mistakes.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","I think we’ve learned some recommendations.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","And I do feel that I’m personally accountable to do what I can to foster measures that will address the problems.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","So, on, on the Vice Chair for Supervision, you know, the place to start is, is the statutory role, which is quite unusual.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","The Vice Chair, it says, shall deploy policy recommendations—“develop policy recommendations for the Board regarding supervision and regulation of depository institution",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","So support for the 25 basis point rate increase was very strong across the board.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","I would say there are a number of people—and,",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","you’ll see this in the minutes.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","I don’t want to try to do the head count in real time.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","But people did talk about pausing,",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","but not so much at this meeting,",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","we’re much closer to the end of this than to the beginning,",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","if you—if you add up all the tightening that’s going on through various channels,",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","But that, again, that’s going to be an ongoing assessment.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","and we’re going to be looking at those factors that we listed and—to determine whether there’s,",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","I just would start with something that’s changed,",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","which is this—the run on Silicon Valley Bank was out of keeping with the speed of runs through history.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","And that now needs to be reflected in some—in some way in regulation and in supervision.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","It—we know—now that we know it’s possible,",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","I think we didn’t—no one thought that was possible.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","No one—I’m not aware of anybody thinking that this could happen so—quite so quickly.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","So I think that, you know, that will play through.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","you know—it will be up to Vice Chair Barr to really take the lead in designing the ways to address that.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","But I think—I think that’s one thing.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","I, I guess I would just say that.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","Then, you know—that we’re going to— obviously, we’re going to revisit [this].",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","It’s pretty clear we need—to me,",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","anyways—clear that we need to strengthen both supervision and regulations for banks of this size.",""
"2023-05-03","Q&A","And I’m, I’m thinking that we’re on the—on track to do that as well.",""

"2023-06-14","Opening Statement","and the full effects of our tightening have yet to be felt.",""

"2023-06-14","Opening Statement","the uncertain lags with which monetary policy affects the economy,",""

"2023-06-14","Q&A","I guess I would—I guess I would go back to the beginning of this tightening cycle to address that.",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","So as we started our rate hikes early last year,",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","we said there were three issues that would need to be addressed kind of in sequence—that of the speed of tightening,",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","the level to which rates would need to go,",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","and then a period of time over which we’d need to keep policy restrictive.",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","the key issue was how fast to move rates up,",""

"2023-06-14","Q&A","I would say about, about July two things: (1) [the] decision hasn’t been made, (2) I do expect that it will be a “live” meeting.",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","the question of speed is a separate question from the question—from the—from,",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","So—and I think if you look at the SEP,",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","that is our estimate—our individual—it’s,",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","it’s really a cumulation of our individual estimates of how far to go.",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","I, I mentioned how, how we got to those numbers.",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","it’s what I said at the beginning,",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","speed was very important last year.",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","As we get closer and closer to the destination—and,",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","we’re not so far away from the destination,",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","it’s reasonable—it’s common sense to go a little slower,",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","just as it was reasonable to go from 75 basis points to 50 to 25 at every meeting.",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","And so the Committee thought overall that it was appropriate to moderate the pace,",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","Then there are benefits to that.",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","So that gives us more information to make decisions.",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","We may try to make better decisions.",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","I think it allows the economy a little more time to adapt as we—as we make our decisions going forward,",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","you know—we haven’t really—we don’t know the full extent of,",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","of the consequences of the banking turmoil that we’ve seen.",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","we—it would be early to see those,",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","but we don’t know what the extent is.",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","We’ll have some more time to see that unfold.",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","I mean, it’s, it’s just the idea that we’re trying to get this right.",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","And this is—if you think of the two things as separate variables,",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","then I think—I think that the skip—I shouldn’t call it a skip—the,",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","I think you’re adding that to the,",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","the data that we’ve seen since the last meeting,",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","we—since we chose to maintain rates at this meeting,",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","it’ll really be a three-month period of data that we can look at.",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","And I think that’s a full quarter,",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","and I think you can—you can draw more conclusions from that than you can from any six—any six- week period.",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","We’ll also look at the evolving risk picture.",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","We’ll look at what’s happening in the financial sector.",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","We’ll look at all the data, the evolving outlook, and we’ll make a decision.",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","I just think we’re following the data and also the outlook.",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","The economy is—the labor market,",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","analysts over the last couple of years with its extraordinary resilience,",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","And it’s, it’s just remarkable.",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","And that’s really, if you think about it—that’s what’s driving it.",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","It’s job it’s, it’s really the, the data.",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","we always write down at these meetings what we think the appropriate terminal rate will be at the end of this year.",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","our own individual assessments of what the most likely path of the economy is.",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","It can be—it can actually, in reality, wind up being lower or higher.",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","And, you know, there’s really no way to know.",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","it’s what people think as of today,",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","and as the—as the data come in,",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","it can move around during the intermeeting period.",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","It could wind up back in the same place.",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","But it really will be data driven.",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","I can’t—I can’t tell you that that I ever have a lot of confidence that we can see where the—where the federal funds rate will be that far in advance.",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","I would say again that I think that,",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","you know—from interest rates that are effectively zero now to 5 percentage points with,",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","with an SEP calling for additional hikes—I think we’ve moved much closer to our destination,",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","which is that sufficiently restrictive rate,",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","and I think that means by—almost by definition that the—that the risks of,",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","of sort of overdoing it and under,",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","there with inflation yet because we’re just looking at the data.",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","And if you look at the—at the full range of,",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","you just—you just aren’t seeing a lot of progress over the last year.",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","inflation has come down materially,",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","we look at core [inflation] as a better indicator of where inflation overall is going.",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","what we’d like to see is credible evidence that inflation is topping out and then beginning to come down.",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","That’s, that’s what we want to see— of course that’s what we want to see.",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","I think it’s—it’s also—we understand that there are lags,",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","it’s more than a year since financial conditions began tightening.",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","I think it’s—I think the reason we’re,",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","we’re comfortable pausing is that we are still—much of the tightening took place over last summer and later into the year.",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","it’s reasonable to think that some of that may come into effect.",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","you know—I think stretching out into a more moderate pace is appropriate to,",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","to allow you to make that judgment of sufficiency,",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","more—with more data over time.",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","So it’s, it’s too early still to, to try to assess the full extent of what that might mean.",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","And, you know, that’s something we’re going to be watching, of course.",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","if we were to see what,",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","what we would view as significant tightening beyond what would normally be expected because of,",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","we would factor that into account on,",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","So that’s, that’s how we think about it.",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","we’ve—we’re two and a half years into this—or two and a quarter years into this.",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","have consistently thought that inflation was about to turn down and,",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","typically forecasted that it would and been wrong.",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","So I think if you—I think if you look at the—at core PCE inflation overall—look at it over the last six months—you’re just not seeing a lot of progress.",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","we’re going to get inflation down to 2 percent over time.",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","we want to do that with the minimum damage we can to the economy,",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","But we have to get inflation down to 2 percent, and we will.",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","And we just don’t see that yet.",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","you see today’s policy decision:",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","both to write down further rate hikes by the end of this year but also to,",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","to moderate somewhat the pace with which we’re moving.",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","I’m not going to comment on any particular paper,",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","I would say that the—I think the overall picture is that at the beginning in,",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","inflation was really becoming from very strong demand for—largely for goods.",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","and they wanted to spend—they spent a lot on goods.",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","at the same time—and because of that high demand,",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","supply chains got all snarled up.",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","and it wasn’t really particularly about the labor market or wages.",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","But as you—as you moved into—through ’21,",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","many analysts believe that it will be important—an important part of getting inflation down,",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","especially in the nonhousing We actually have seen wages broadly move down but just at a quite gradual pace.",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","that’s a little bit of the finding of the Bernanke paper with Blanchard of a few weeks ago,",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","which is very consistent with,",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","So I, I don’t want to deal with, with hypotheticals about different ways data might move.",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","And so, we, you know—we of course—we’re not—we don’t go out of our way to surprise markets or the public.",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","At the same time, our main focus has to be on getting the policy right.",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","And that’s, that’s what we’re doing here, and that’s what we’ll do for the upcoming meetings.",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","if you just look at—I’ll just point you to the forecast.",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","So inflation is running—core PCE inflation is running at about 4½,",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","a little higher than 4½ percent.",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","the median FOMC participant thinks it will go down to 3.9 on a 12-month basis.",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","This is by the end of this year.",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","So that’s expecting pretty substantial progress.",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","That’s, that’s a pretty significant decline for half a year.",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","So that’s, that’s the forecast.",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","You know, we’ll—we do try to be transparent in our reaction function.",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","We’re, we’re committed to getting inflation down.",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","And that’s the number-one thing.",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","So that’s how I think about it.",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","So let me say, first of all, on the Treasury part of it—if I can talk about that and then go back to the balance sheet.",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","So on that—of course, we’ve been very focused on that for a couple of months, as everyone has.",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","[The] Treasury has laid out its borrowing plans publicly.",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","I think we all saw—I saw the Secretary’s comments yesterday to the So that’s, that’s from the Treasury, which actually sets the, you know, the, the borrowings.",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","At the Fed, we’ll be monitoring market conditions carefully as the Treasury refills the, the",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","we have a number of—I would say the [ON] RRP [facility] doesn’t look like it’s,",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","it’s pulling money out of—out of the banking system.",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","It’s actually been shrinking here lately.",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","So I don’t think—that’s not something, something we’ve thought about a lot over time.",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","It doesn’t really look like that’s, that’s something that we would do.",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","I think it’s—I think it’s a tool that we have.",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","There are other tools we can—we can use to address money market issues.",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","But I wouldn’t say that that’s something that’s likely that we would do in the near term.",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","cooling in the housing market to bring inflation down?",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","how does the recent rebound affect your forecasts,",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","and how does it factor into monetary policy?",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","So certainly housing—very interest sensitive,",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","that’s either helped by low rates or,",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","And we certainly saw that over the course of the last year.",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","We now see housing putting in a bottom and maybe even moving up a little bit.",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","You know, we’re watching that situation carefully.",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","I do think we—we will see rents,",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","and house prices filtering into,",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","And I, I don’t see them coming up quickly.",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","I do see them kind of—kind of wandering around at a relatively low level now,",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","Well, I think we, we look at everything.",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","We don’t just look at housing.",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","So I think, you know, the way it works is the individual participants sit in their offices all over the country, and they write down their forecast and—including their most likely forecasts—including their rate forecast.",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","And then they send it in on Friday afternoon, and we cumulate it, and then we publish it for you.",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","So that’s how—that’s how they do that.",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","Well, I don’t know that housing is, is itself going to be driving the rates picture, but it’s part of it.",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","We—we hope and expect that other policymakers will respect our independence on, on monetary policy.",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","And we don’t see ourselves as, as, you know, the judges of appropriate fiscal policy.",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","I will say, and many of my predecessors have said, that we’re on an unsustainable fiscal path and, and that needs to be addressed over time.",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","But I think trying to get into, into that with lawmakers would be—would be kind of inappropriate, given our independence and our need to stick to our knitting.",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","You know, I—I would just say it this way.",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","I continue to think—and this really hasn’t changed—that there is a path to getting inflation back down to 2 percent without having to see the kind of sharp downturn and,",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","and large losses of employment that we’ve come back to the,",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","we see—the Committee— as you can see from the SEP,",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","the Committee is completely unified in the need to get inflation down to 2 percent and will do whatever it takes to get it down to 2 percent over time.",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","And, you know, we, we understand that allowing inflation to get entrenched into the—in the",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","if you look two and three years out with,",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","with the forecast—first of all,",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","I wouldn’t—I wouldn’t put too much weight on forecasts even one year out because they’re,",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","But what they’re showing is that as inflation comes down in the—in the forecast,",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","if you don’t lower interest rates,",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","then real rates are actually going up,",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","So just to maintain a real rate,",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","the nominal rate at that point—two years out,",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","let’s say—should come down just to maintain real rates.",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","we’re having real rates that are going to have to be meaningfully positive and significantly.",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","So for us to get inflation down,",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","that it will be appropriate to cut rates at such time as inflation is do I think it is at all likely to be appropriate,",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","Inflation has not really moved down.",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","It has—it has not so far reacted much to our—to our existing rate hikes.",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","And so we’re going have to keep at it.",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","worried about—there are—there are long- standing differences in racial and ethnic groups across,",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","That’s a factor that we don’t—we can’t really address with our tools.",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","But we do consider that when we’re thinking about what constitutes maximum employment—it is,",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","has been bouncing around right near historic lows—historic modern lows here.",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","what is as strong a labor market as we’ve seen in,",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","a half- century here in the United States.",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","So overall unemployment of 3.7 percent is,",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","is higher—three- tenths higher than it was measured to be at the last—a month ago.",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","But, still, it’s extraordinarily low.",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","And so it’s a very, very tight labor market.",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","I wouldn’t say—that’s, you know—as a factual matter, that’s correct.",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","We do need to see, you know, rents bottom out here or at least stay quite low in terms of their increases because we want—we want the, you know, we want inflation to come down.",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","And rental is, is a very large part of the CPI—about a third—and it’s about half of that for the",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","So wages will continue to increase.",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","you know—what we’re talking about is having wage increases still at a very strong level but at a level that’s extremely elevated—highly elevated levels a year or so ago,",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","And, and, you know, we want to see that, that process continue gradually.",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","it’s great to see wage increases,",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","particularly for people at the lower end of the income spectrum.",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","But we want that as part of the process of getting inflation back down to 2 percent,",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","I mean, inflation hurts those same people more than anyone else.",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","People on a fixed income are hurt the worst, and the fastest, by high inflation.",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","So the topic of wages in the labor market and dynamics in the labor market could—is about as central a topic to our discussions as,",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","I mean, it’s, it’s very—labor economics, you know, and the labor market are utterly central.",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","You know, it’s half of our mandate.",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","So we spend a lot of time talking about that.",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","there are structural issues that are really not for the Fed.",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","And so we don’t spend a lot of time— although we take notice of,",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","you know—we’re not involved in discussions or debates over,",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","over strikes and things like that.",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","But we—you know, we, we look, and we see what’s going on.",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","we’re making judgments about what it will take to get inflation down to 2 percent in the aggregate.",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","don’t think that was about—I the part of the economy where we have seen the least progress.",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","So I’m trying to think where to start.",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","I’ll start with commercial real estate.",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","We—of course, we’re watching that situation very carefully.",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","There’s a substantial amount of commercial real estate in the banking system.",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","A, a large part of it is in smaller banks.",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","It’s well distributed—to the extent it’s well distributedthen, then the system could, could take losses.",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","We do expect that there will be losses,",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","but they’ll be—they’ll be banks that have concentrations,",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","and those banks will experience larger losses.",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","it feels like—it feels like something that will be around for some time,",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","something that will suddenly hit and,",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","work its way into systemic risk.",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","In terms of nonbank financials—financial sector—there’s been a ton of work.",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","clearly in the—in the pandemic,",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","it really was—it was the nonbank financial sector where,",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","there’s a lot of work going on in—with the Administration,",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","leading that to try to address issues in the Treasury market and,",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","and in all kinds of areas in the nonbank financial market.",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","in terms of the events of March—as I mentioned earlier,",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","we will be carefully monitoring that situation.",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","our job generally involves worrying about a lot of things that may go wrong,",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","and that would include the banks.",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","It might be hard for me to identify something that we don’t worry about rather than that we do worry about.",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","So we’re watching those things very carefully.",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","And as we see things unfold—as we see what’s happening with credit conditions and,",""
"2023-06-14","Q&A","and also all the individual banks that are out there,",""

"2023-07-26","Q&A","do we assess it as suggesting that we need to raise rates further?",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","And if we make that conclusion, then we will go ahead and raise rates.",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","So that’s how we’re thinking about I will also say,",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","between now and the September meeting,",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","I think we have an ECI report coming later this week—which is [an] employment compensation index—and lots of data on economic activity.",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","All of that information is going to inform our decision as we go into that meeting.",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","I would say it is certainly possible that we would raise funds again at the September meeting if the data warrant it,",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","and I would also say it’s possible that we would choose to hold steady at that meeting.",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","We’re going to be making careful assessments,",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","and I’ll close by saying we’ve raised the federal funds rate now by 525 basis points since March 2022.",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","is restrictive and is putting downward pressure on economic activity and inflation.",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","I’m just going to go back to what I said.",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","We, we—you know, that’s the question.",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","We have eight weeks now until the September meeting,",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","and all that data that I recited,",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","we’re going to be looking at all that and making that assessment then.",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","And it really—we did have the one good reading, and, of course, we welcome that.",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","But it’s just one reading, as everybody knows.",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","And, and, you know, we’ve seen—we’ve seen this before in the data.",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","but we just don’t know that until we see the data.",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","The overall resilience of the economy,",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","that we’ve been able to achieve disinflation so far without any meaningful negative impact on the labor market,",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","the strength of the economy—overall,",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","It’s good to see that, of course.",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","It’s also—you see consumer, consumer confidence coming up and things like that.",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","That will support activity going forward.",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","But you’re, you’re right, though.",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","and that would require an appropriate response for monetary policy.",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","So we’ll be watching that carefully and seeing how it evolves over time.",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","So it’s hard to pick the pieces apart and say, you know, how much of this and how much of that.",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","You know, we’ll be looking at everything.",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","And, you know, we’ll, of course, we’ll be looking to see whether the signal from June’s CPI is replicated or, or the opposite of replicated or whether it’s somewhere in the middle.",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","We’ll be looking at the growth data.",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","We’ll be looking at the labor market data very closely, of course, and making an overall",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","So I’m just going to tell you again what we’re going to do.",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","at two additional job reports,",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","and that’s what we’re going to look at,",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","and we’re going to make that decision then.",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","or it could mean that we decide to maintain at that level.",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","the question we’re going to be asking ourselves is,",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","is the overall signal one that we need to do more,",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","that we need to tighten further?",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","then—and that’s the collective judgment of the Committee— then we will move ahead.",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","then we’ll have the option of maintaining policy at that level,",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","it’s really dependent so much on the data,",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","and we just don’t have it yet.",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","So I guess I would put it this way.",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","how do you balance the two risks,",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","the risk of doing too much or doing too little?",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","we’re coming to a place where,",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","where there really are risks on both sides.",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","It’s hard to say exactly whether,",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","whether they’re in balance or not,",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","but as our—as our stance has become more restrictive and inflation moderates,",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","we do increasingly face that risk.",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","we need to see that inflation is durably down that far,",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","that core inflation is actually a better signal of,",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","of where headline inflation is going,",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","because headline inflation is affected greatly by volatile energy and food prices.",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","So we would want core inflation to be coming down,",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","because that’s what we think—that’s—core is signaling where headline is going to go in the future.",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","And core inflation is still pretty elevated, you know?",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","There’s reason to think it can come down now,",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","and so we think we need to stay on task,",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","So it is—it is a very positive thing that,",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","the unemployment rate is the same as it was when we lifted off in March of ’22,",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","So that’s a real blessing in that we’ve been able to achieve some disinflation,",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","It’s not that we’re aiming to,",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","the historical record—we have to be honest about the historical record,",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","which does suggest that when central banks go in and slow the economy to bring down inflation,",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","the result tends to be some softening in labor market conditions.",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","And so that is still the, the likely outcome here.",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","we hope that that’s as little as possible,",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","but we have to be honest that that is—that is the likely outcome.",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","The worst outcome for everyone,",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","would be not to deal with inflation now,",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","Whatever the short-term social costs of getting inflation under control,",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","the longer- term social costs of failing to do so are greater,",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","and the historical record is very,",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","If you go through a period where inflation expectations are not anchored,",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","it interferes with people’s lives and with economic activity,",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","that’s the— that’s the thing we,",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","we really need to avoid and will avoid.",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","the broader picture of what we want to see is,",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","we want to see easing of supply constraints and normalization of pandemic-related distortions to demand and supply.",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","We want to see economic growth running at moderate or modest levels to help ease inflationary pressures.",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","We want to see continued restoration of supply and demand balance,",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","particularly in the labor market.",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","And all of that should lead to declining inflationary pressures.",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","Now what we see is, we see those pieces of the puzzle coming together.",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","And we’re seeing evidence of those things now,",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","but I would—I would say that what,",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","what our eyes are telling us is that policy has not been restrictive long,",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","restrictive enough for long enough to have its full desired effects.",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","to keep policy restrictive until we’re confident that inflation is coming down sustainably to our 2 percent target,",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","and we’re prepared to further tighten if that is appropriate.",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","So a more gradual pace doesn’t go immediately to [moving] every other meeting.",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","It could be two out of three meetings, right?",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","It could be—it just means if you’re slowing down,",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","the point really was to slow down the decision cycle as,",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","as we get closer and closer to,",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","And I wouldn’t want to go automatically to [moving] every other meeting,",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","because I just don’t think that’s—we don’t—I think it’s not an environment where we want to provide a lot of forward guidance.",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","There’s a lot of uncertainty out there.",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","We just want to keep moving at what we think is the right pace,",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","and I do think it makes all the sense in the world to slow down as we now make these finely judged decisions,",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","And so I, I think it’s possible.",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","It’s possible that we would move at consecutive meetings—we’re not taking that off the table—or we might not.",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","It’s really going to depend on what the data tell us.",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","So there’s a long-running debate about the lags between changes in financial conditions and the response to those changes from economic activity and inflation,",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","So we know that in the modern era,",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","financial conditions move in anticipation of our decisions,",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","and that has clearly been the case in this cycle.",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","So, in a sense, the clock starts earlier than it—than it used to.",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","But that doesn’t necessarily change the process from that point on,",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","and it’s not clear that it has.",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","We also—this is—I’ll tell you what we know and then what we don’t know.",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","We know that financial conditions affect economic activity and inflation with a lag that can be long and variable,",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","that can be long and variable—a lot of uncertainty around the length of the lags.",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","And, by the way, that’s just one component of the broader uncertainty that we face.",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","So I’ll tell you how I—how I think about this.",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","we’re determined to bring inflation down to 2 percent over time,",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","and we will use our tools to do that.",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","I would look at it this way, though.",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","The real federal funds rate is now in meaningfully positive territory.",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","If you take the nominal federal funds rate,",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","subtract the mainstream estimate of near-term inflation expectations,",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","you get a real federal funds rate that is economic activity and inflation.",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","We’ll keep monetary policy restrictive until we think it’s not appropriate to do so.",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","So that’s how I think about it.",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","I mean, if I sum it up, I would say: We’ve come a long way.",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","We are resolutely committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent goal over time.",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","has proved stronger than we and other forecasts—forecasters have expected,",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","We have to be ready to follow the data,",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","we can afford to be a little patient,",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","So I guess that the SLOOS will come out early next week, and I would just say it’s broadly condition—consistent with what you would expect.",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","You’ve got lending conditions tight and getting a little tighter.",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","You’ve got weak demand, and, you know, it, it gives a picture of pretty tight credit conditions in the economy.",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","I think it’s really hard to tease out whether—how much of that is from this source or that source, but I think what matters is, the overall picture is of tight and tightening lending conditions.",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","And that’s, that’s what the SLOOS will say.",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","So let me start by saying that the inflation surge that we saw in the pandemic resulted from a collision of elevated demand and,",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","both of which followed from the unprecedented features of the pandemic and the response from fiscal and monetary policy.",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","And we’ve always expected that the disinflationary process would stem from,",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","both from the normalization of those broad pandemic- related supply and demand conditions and from restrictive,",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","which would help return the balance between supply and demand by restraining demand.",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","And we think that’s broadly what we’re—what we’re seeing.",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","break it down a little further:",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","headline inflation has come down sharply from elevated levels as energy and food prices have come down,",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","mostly due to [a] reversal of the effects [on those prices that resulted] from the war in Ukraine.",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","And that’s, that’s a good thing, and the public experiences that, as I mentioned earlier.",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","I’d say there also—there has been a role for,",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","normalization of supply conditions is playing an important role,",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","the beginning of the reversal,",""

"2023-07-26","Q&A","So I think that, as it relates to goods, it’s really an indication that supply chains and, and shortages are easing.",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","And so, what was the first part of it?",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","I don’t—I don’t think we’re targeting wage inflation.",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","I think what we’re—what we’re looking for is a broad cooling in labor market conditions.",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","So wages have actually been gradually moving down.",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","They’re still at levels what would—that would be consistent over a long period of time with 2 percent inflation.",""

"2023-07-26","Q&A","So I think we see that, and it’s happening at a gradual pace.",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","So that’s actually not a bad thing,",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","if what we see is a labor market,",""

"2023-07-26","Q&A","I think you’d take everything into account when you start cutting rates.",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","It would—it would depend on the whole, on a wide range of things.",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","when people are writing down rate cuts next year,",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","it just is a sense that inflation is coming down,",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","and we’re comfortable that it’s coming down,",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","and it’s time to start cutting rates.",""

"2023-07-26","Q&A","let alone the year after that.",""

"2023-07-26","Q&A","I think the median was several for next year.",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","And that’s just going to be a judgment that we have to make then, a full year from now,",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","it has been my view consistently that we do have a shot,",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","and my base case is that we will be able to achieve inflation moving back down to our target without the kind of really significant downturn that results in high levels of job losses that we’ve seen in some past—in some past instances,",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","many past instances of tightening that look like ours.",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","that that’s sort of consistent with,",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","So—but it’s a long way from assured,",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","we have a lot left to go to see that happen.",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","So the staff now has a noticeable slowdown in growth starting later this year in the forecast,",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","but given the resilience of the economy recently,",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","they are no longer forecasting a recession.",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","I just want to note that it’s—that our staff produces its own forecast,",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","which is independent of the forecasts that we as FOMC participants produce.",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","Having an independent staff forecast as well as the individual participant forecasts is really a strength of our—of our process.",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","constructive diversity of opinion that,",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","that helps us make— informs our deliberations—helps us make,",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","I wouldn’t use the term “optimism” about this yet.",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","that’s a good way to think about it.",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","we’ve seen so far the beginnings of disinflation without any real costs in the labor market.",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","And that’s, that’s a really good thing.",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","I would just also say the historical record suggests that there’s very likely to be some softening in labor market conditions.",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","And consistent with having a soft landing,",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","you would—you would have some softening in labor market conditions,",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","and that’s still likely as we—as we go forward with this process.",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","But it’s a good thing to date that we haven’t— we haven’t really seen that.",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","We’ve seen softening through other—not through unemployment, not through higher unemployment.",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","job openings coming down part of the way back to more normal levels;",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","so people are not quitting as much;",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","we’ve seen participation—people coming in,",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","which has lowered the temperature in the labor market,",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","So we’re seeing that kind of cooling,",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","So the idea that we would keep hiking until inflation gets to 2 percent—it would be a prescription [for a policy] of going way past the target.",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","That’s, that’s clearly not the appropriate way to think about it.",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","these are forecasting out years,",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","so take them with a grain of salt.",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","But people are cutting rates next year because,",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","the federal funds rate is at a restrictive level now.",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","So if we see inflation coming down credibly,",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","then we don’t need to be at a restrictive level anymore.",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","we can move back to a—to a neutral level and then below a neutral level at a certain point.",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","would be very careful about that.",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","We’d really want to be sure that inflation is coming down in a sustainable level.",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","And it’s hard to make—I’m not going to try to make a numerical assessment of when and where that would be.",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","But that’s the way I would think about it,",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","is you’d start—you’d stop raising long before you got to 2 percent inflation,",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","and you’d start cutting before you got to 2 percent inflation,",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","because we don’t see ourselves getting to 2 percent inflation until—you know,",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","all the way back to 2—until 2025 or so.",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","So I don’t want to comment on any particular merger proposal,",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","things have settled down for sure out there.",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","Capital and liquidity remain strong.",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","Aggregate bank lending was stable quarter over quarter and is up significantly year over year.",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","Banking-sector profits generally are coming in strong this quarter.",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","And, overall, the banking system remains strong and resilient.",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","the situation carefully and monitoring,",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","the actual effect on—if you think of a particular set of banks that were,",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","were affected because of their size and business model and things like that,",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","that were more affected by the turmoil in March than others,",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","it’s very hard to sort of tease out the effects on this very large economy of ours from them tightening.",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","They may be tightening a little bit more, probably are, than other banks.",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","The SLOOS has been telling us for more than a year that banking conditions are tightening.",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","That process is ongoing, and that will restrain economic growth.",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","So I think—I think we have to take a step back from “I can’t separate those anymore.” I think—I think,",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","we’re just looking at the overall picture,",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","which is one of tightening credit conditions.",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","And that’s, that’s going to restrain economic activity.",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","It is restraining economic activity.",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","So that’s how I would look at it.",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","[growth in nominal] wages in excess of inflation means [that increases in] real wages are positive.",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","We want people to have [gains in] real wages.",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","But we want wages to be going up at a level that’s consistent with,",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","with 2 percent inflation over time.",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","[increases in] nominal wages have been coming down gradually,",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","and that’s what we want to see.",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","We expect to see more of that.",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","That’s just more of what’s consistent over a longer period of time.",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","that wages were an important cause of inflation in the first year or so of the outbreak.",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","But I would say that wages are probably an important issue going forward.",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","Labor market conditions broadly are going to be an important part of,",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","of getting inflation back down,",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","and that’s why we think we need some further softening in labor market conditions.",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","be some sort of a rebound there,",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","and I’m curious what the Fed’s explanation would be to families if further interest rate hikes start to hit the labor market—start to,",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","drive that sentiment back down.",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","of why you continue to keep rates elevated or to raise them?",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","we have a job assigned to us by Congress to get inflation under control.",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","the single most important thing we can do to benefit those very families,",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","especially families at the lower end of the income spectrum,",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","is to get inflation sustainably under control and restore price stability.",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","We think that is the most important thing we can do now,",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","and we’re determined to do that.",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","And I would just point out that the people who are the most hurt by inflation right away are people who are on a low fixed income,",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","when you’re talking about travel or,",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","those—if you’re just making it through each month on your paycheck and prices go up,",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","Even middle-class people have some resources and can absorb inflation.",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","people on the lower end of the income spectrum have a harder time doing that.",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","So we need—we need to get this done.",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","the record is clear that if we—if we take too long or if,",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","that the pain will only be greater.",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","So that’s, that’s how I would explain what we’re doing.",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","you could—“Was there doubt?” Look,",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","I would say there’s a range of views on the Committee,",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","and when you see the minutes in three weeks,",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","There’s a range of views about what we should do at this meeting and what we should do at the next meeting,",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","and it’s a—it’s a process that we go through.",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","Many times when we go into a meeting,",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","and I’ll just leave it at that.",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","So we monitor, of course, financial conditions, broad financial conditions.",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","It’s the dollar and equities, but—and, you know, we’re, of course, very focused on rates and our own policy.",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","we will—we’re going to use our policy tools to—working through financial conditions—to get inflation under control The implication is,",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","we will do what it takes to get inflation down,",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","that could mean that if financial conditions get looser,",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","with—so if you think about both of them as normalization,",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","imagine it’s a world where things are okay,",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","and it’s time to bring rates down from what are restrictive levels to more normal levels.",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","would be to reduce QT or to continue it,",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","depending on where you are in the cycle.",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","So they are two independent things.",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","And, you know, really, the active tool of monetary policy is rates.",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","But you can imagine circumstances in which it would be appropriate to have them working in what might be seen to be just different ways.",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","But that wouldn’t be the case.",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","So that’s a very important thing.",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","And yes to both sides of that.",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","You know, yes, banks are now working to see that they are ready to use the discount window, and we are strongly encouraging them to do that—banks broadly.",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","We did find, as you know, during the events of March and that, you know, that it’s a little clunkier.",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","I think we’ve got a ways to go to get back to balance,",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","for the reasons that you talked about.",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","there are many people who have low-rate mortgages,",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","and whereas they might want to sell in a normal situation,",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","they’re not going to because they have such,",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","whch means that supply of existing homes is really,",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","there’s a lot of supply coming on line now,",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","and there are people coming in.",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","with these relatively elevated mortgage rates.",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","But I think this will take some time to work through.",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","Hopefully, more supply comes on line, and, you know, we, we work through it.",""
"2023-07-26","Q&A","We’re still living through the, you know, the aftermath of the—of the pandemic.",""

"2023-09-20","Q&A","which is progress toward our—toward our inflation goal,",""

"2023-09-20","Q&A","that’s the progress that we want to see.",""
"2023-09-20","Q&A","But I think people—they want to be convinced,",""
"2023-09-20","Q&A","you know—they want to be careful to—not to jump to a conclusion,",""
"2023-09-20","Q&A","one way or the other—but just be convinced that the data,",""
"2023-09-20","Q&A","given how far we’ve come and how quickly we’ve come,",""

"2023-09-20","Q&A","it’s a pretty tight cluster of,",""
"2023-09-20","Q&A","what we wrote down—it’s actually gotten higher and higher.",""
"2023-09-20","Q&A","we don’t really know until—and that’s why,",""
"2023-09-20","Q&A","we—we’re in a position to proceed carefully at this point.",""
"2023-09-20","Q&A","A year ago, we proceeded pretty quickly to get rates up.",""
"2023-09-20","Q&A","Now—now we’re fairly close, we think, to where we need to get.",""
"2023-09-20","Q&A","It’s, it’s just a question of reaching the right stance.",""
"2023-09-20","Q&A","I wouldn’t attribute huge importance to one hike in, in macroeconomic terms.",""
"2023-09-20","Q&A","we need—we need to get to a place where we’re confident that we have a stance that will bring inflation down to 2 percent over time.",""
"2023-09-20","Q&A","That’s what we need to get to,",""
"2023-09-20","Q&A","As we’ve gotten closer to it, we’ve slowed the pace at which we’ve moved.",""
"2023-09-20","Q&A","And now that we’re getting closer,",""
"2023-09-20","Q&A","we have the ability to proceed carefully.",""
"2023-09-20","Q&A","I guess I would point more to—rather than pointing to a sense of inflation having become more persistent,",""
"2023-09-20","Q&A","if I had to attribute one thing—again,",""
"2023-09-20","Q&A","we’re picking medians here and trying to attribute one explanation.",""
"2023-09-20","Q&A","means rates— we have to do more with rates,",""
"2023-09-20","Q&A","and that’s what—that’s what that meaning is,",""
"2023-09-20","Q&A","of what the neutral rate can be—you know,",""
"2023-09-20","Q&A","We only know it by its works, really.",""
"2023-09-20","Q&A","you only know when you get there and by,",""
"2023-09-20","Q&A","by the way the economy reacts.",""
"2023-09-20","Q&A","that’s another reason why we’re—why we’re moving carefully now,",""
"2023-09-20","Q&A","So it, it may—it may, of course, be that the—that the neutral rate has risen.",""
"2023-09-20","Q&A","You do see people—you don’t see the median moving—but you do see people raising their estimates of,",""
"2023-09-20","Q&A","and it’s certainly plausible that the neutral rate is higher than,",""
"2023-09-20","Q&A","Remember—what we write down in the SEP is the longer-run rate.",""
"2023-09-20","Q&A","It is certainly possible that,",""
"2023-09-20","Q&A","that the—that the neutral rate at this moment is higher than that,",""
"2023-09-20","Q&A","and that—that’s part of the explanation for why the economy has been more resilient than,",""
"2023-09-20","Q&A","It is a—it is a good thing that we,",""
"2023-09-20","Q&A","we’ve seen now meaningful rebalancing in the labor market without an increase in unemployment,",""
"2023-09-20","Q&A","that’s because we’re seeing that rebalancing in other places—in,",""
"2023-09-20","Q&A","job openings and in the jobs–worker gap.",""
"2023-09-20","Q&A","You’re also seeing supply-side things—so, so that’s happening.",""
"2023-09-20","Q&A","that there will have to be some softening in the labor market that can come through more supply,",""
"2023-09-20","Q&A","the gap between any given unemployment rate that’s lower than that and the natural rate comes down.",""
"2023-09-20","Q&A","That’s a way for supply—that’s a way for the labor market to achieve a better balance.",""
"2023-09-20","Q&A","So all of those things are happening.",""
"2023-09-20","Q&A","You’re right—in, in the median forecast, we don’t see a big increase in unemployment.",""
"2023-09-20","Q&A","and—but that’s—that really is just “playing forward” the trends that we’ve been seeing.",""
"2023-09-20","Q&A","there may come a time when unemployment goes up more than that,",""
"2023-09-20","Q&A","that’s really what we’ve been seeing is,",""
"2023-09-20","Q&A","progress without higher unemployment for now.",""
"2023-09-20","Q&A","I, I would just say—what, what would I say about that?",""
"2023-09-20","Q&A","I’ve always thought that the soft landing was,",""
"2023-09-20","Q&A","was a plausible outcome—that there was a path,",""
"2023-09-20","Q&A","I’ve thought that, and I’ve said that since we lifted off.",""
"2023-09-20","Q&A","It’s also possible that, that the path has narrowed, and it’s widened, apparently.",""
"2023-09-20","Q&A","Ultimately, a position to, to move carefully again.",""
"2023-09-20","Q&A","That—we, we will restore price stability.",""
"2023-09-20","Q&A","we know that we have to do that,",""
"2023-09-20","Q&A","and we know the public depends on us doing that,",""
"2023-09-20","Q&A","and we know that we have to do it so that we can achieve the kind of labor market that we all want to achieve,",""
"2023-09-20","Q&A","which is an extended period—sustained period of strong labor market conditions that benefit all.",""
"2023-09-20","Q&A","The fact that we’ve come this far lets us really proceed carefully,",""
"2023-09-20","Q&A","So I think, you know, that’s, that’s the end we’re trying to achieve.",""
"2023-09-20","Q&A","I wouldn’t want to handicap the likelihood of it, though.",""
"2023-09-20","Q&A","we understand that it’s a real rate that will matter and that needs to be sufficiently restrictive.",""
"2023-09-20","Q&A","And, again, I would say, you know—you know “sufficiently restrictive” only when you see it.",""
"2023-09-20","Q&A","You—it’s not something you can arrive at with confidence in a model or,",""
"2023-09-20","Q&A","the unwinding of the pandemic-related demand and supply distortions and monetary policy’s work in suppressing goods—also in housing services.",""
"2023-09-20","Q&A","You begin to see effects of it in nonhousing services as well.",""
"2023-09-20","Q&A","So I think—we think that that is working.",""
"2023-09-20","Q&A","we want to reach that—we want to reach something that we’re confident gets us to that level.",""
"2023-09-20","Q&A","And I think confidence comes from seeing,",""
"2023-09-20","Q&A","enough data that you feel like,",""
"2023-09-20","Q&A","this feels like it—we can—we can,",""
"2023-09-20","Q&A","decide that this is the right level and just agree to stay here.” We’re not permanently deciding not to go higher,",""
"2023-09-20","Q&A","if we get to that level—and then the question is,",""
"2023-09-20","Q&A","how long do you stay at that level?",""
"2023-09-20","Q&A","And that’s a whole other set of questions.",""
"2023-09-20","Q&A","the question is trying to find that level where we think we can stay there.",""
"2023-09-20","Q&A","And we haven’t—we haven’t gotten to a point of confidence about that yet.",""
"2023-09-20","Q&A","That’s, that’s what we’re—that’s, that’s the stage we’re at, though.",""
"2023-09-20","Q&A","The decision that we make at,",""
"2023-09-20","Q&A","at the—at the last two meetings this year—it’s going to depend on the totality of all the data: so,",""
"2023-09-20","Q&A","and the other events that are happening out there.",""
"2023-09-20","Q&A","We’ll make—we take all of that into account, so I can’t really answer a hypothetical about one piece of that.",""
"2023-09-20","Q&A","It’ll—it’ll be trying to reach a us be more confident that we’ve gotten to the level that we need to get to.",""
"2023-09-20","Q&A","When—so when I answer these questions about hypotheticals about,",""
"2023-09-20","Q&A","I’m never intending to send a signal about timing;",""
"2023-09-20","Q&A","So, so please—I, I wouldn’t want to be taken that way.",""
"2023-09-20","Q&A","Sorry— the first question was, is that how?",""
"2023-09-20","Q&A","so we’re—as we go into next year,",""
"2023-09-20","Q&A","that’s the question we’ll be asking is—you know,",""
"2023-09-20","Q&A","and everything else we know about the economy and everything we know about monetary policy,",""
"2023-09-20","Q&A","the time will come at some point,",""
"2023-09-20","Q&A","that it’s—that it’s appropriate to cut.",""
"2023-09-20","Q&A","Part of that may be that real rates are rising because inflation is coming down.",""
"2023-09-20","Q&A","Part of it just may be that—it’ll be all the factors that we see in the economy.",""
"2023-09-20","Q&A","And, you know, that time will certainly come at some point.",""
"2023-09-20","Q&A","when we—in the moment, we’ll do what we think makes sense.",""
"2023-09-20","Q&A","No one will look back at this and say,",""
"2023-09-20","Q&A","we made a plan.” It’s not like that at all.",""
"2023-09-20","Q&A","It’s—this is—these are estimates made a year in advance that are highly uncertain,",""
"2023-09-20","Q&A","So on, on your first question—I mean, we’re looking at GDP very, very carefully to try to understand really what’s the direction of it—what’s, what’s driving it.",""
"2023-09-20","Q&A","And it’s, it’s a lot of consumer spending, you know.",""
"2023-09-20","Q&A","It’s been—the consumer’s been very robust in its—in spending.",""
"2023-09-20","Q&A","So that is, you know, that’s how we’re looking at it.",""
"2023-09-20","Q&A","Sorry, your second question was—",""
"2023-09-20","Q&A","So I, I think the question will be—GDP is not our mandate, right?",""
"2023-09-20","Q&A","Maximum employment and price stability are the mandates.",""
"2023-09-20","Q&A","The question will be, is, is the level—is GDP—is the—is the heat that we see in GDP—is it really a threat to our ability to get back to 2 percent inflation?",""
"2023-09-20","Q&A","That’s going to be the question.",""
"2023-09-20","Q&A","It’s not—it’s not a question about GDP on its own.",""
"2023-09-20","Q&A","It’s, you—you know, you’re expecting to see the—this improvement, you know—continued rebalancing in the labor market and inflation moving back down to 2 percent",""
"2023-09-20","Q&A","So there is a—there is a long list, and you hit some of them.",""
"2023-09-20","Q&A","resumption of student loan payments,",""
"2023-09-20","Q&A","You know, you could—there are a lot of things that you can—you can look at.",""
"2023-09-20","Q&A","what we try to do is assess all of them and,",""
"2023-09-20","Q&A","And, ultimately, though, there’s so much uncertainty around, around these things.",""
"2023-09-20","Q&A","to start with the strike—first of all,",""
"2023-09-20","Q&A","we absolutely don’t comment on the strike,",""
"2023-09-20","Q&A","as we have no view on the strike one way or the other.",""
"2023-09-20","Q&A","we do have to make an assessment of its economic effects to do our jobs.",""
"2023-09-20","Q&A","So, you know, the, the thing about it is—so uncertain.",""
"2023-09-20","Q&A","The economic effects—it could affect—you’ve looked—we’ve looked back at history—it could affect economic output,",""
"2023-09-20","Q&A","But that’s really going to depend on how broad it is and how long it’s sustained for.",""
"2023-09-20","Q&A","And we—and then it also depends on how quickly production can make up for,",""
"2023-09-20","Q&A","So none of those things are known right now.",""
"2023-09-20","Q&A","So you just have to leave that uncertain.",""
"2023-09-20","Q&A","over the course of the next intermeeting period,",""
"2023-09-20","Q&A","And the same is true for the others.",""
"2023-09-20","Q&A","we—I don’t know if you You know,",""
"2023-09-20","Q&A","energy prices being higher—that’s—that is a significant thing.",""
"2023-09-20","Q&A","We—energy prices being up can affect spending.",""

"2023-09-20","Q&A","A sustained period of higher—of higher energy prices can affect consumer expectations about inflation.",""
"2023-09-20","Q&A","We tend to look through short-term volatility and look at—look at core inflation.",""
"2023-09-20","Q&A","But so the question is, how long are, are higher prices sustained?",""
"2023-09-20","Q&A","We have to—we have to take those macroeconomic effects into account as well.",""
"2023-09-20","Q&A","Those are—those are some of them.",""
"2023-09-20","Q&A","I’m not sure if I hit them all.",""
"2023-09-20","Q&A","you’re coming into this with an economy that appears to have significant momentum.",""
"2023-09-20","Q&A","And that’s, that’s what we start with.",""
"2023-09-20","Q&A","And we—but we do have this collection of risks that you mentioned.",""
"2023-09-20","Q&A","To begin: A soft landing is a primary objective, and I did not say otherwise.",""
"2023-09-20","Q&A","I mean, that’s, that’s what we’ve been trying to achieve for all this time.",""
"2023-09-20","Q&A","and you go through—you can have a long period where the economy’s just very uncertain,",""
"2023-09-20","Q&A","it will affect all kinds of things.",""
"2023-09-20","Q&A","It can be a miserable period to have inflation constantly coming back and the Fed coming in and having to tighten again and again.",""
"2023-09-20","Q&A","So the best thing we can do for everyone,",""
"2023-09-20","Q&A","is to restore price stability.",""
"2023-09-20","Q&A","we have the ability to be careful at this point and move carefully,",""
"2023-09-20","Q&A","and that’s what we’re planning to do.",""

"2023-09-20","Q&A","I think we knew from the time—from before when we lifted off,",""

"2023-09-20","Q&A","in getting to a conclusion about what to do.",""

"2023-09-20","Q&A","I mean, gas prices are one of the big things that, that affects consumer sentiment.",""
"2023-09-20","Q&A","It, it really comes down to how persistent—how sustained these energy prices are.",""
"2023-09-20","Q&A","The reason why we look at core inflation,",""
"2023-09-20","Q&A","which excludes food and energy,",""

"2023-09-20","Q&A","You know, turning to consumer credit, you know—of course, we watch that carefully.",""
"2023-09-20","Q&A","Consumer distress— measures of distress among consumers were at historic lows quite recently,",""

"2023-09-20","Q&A","You know, rates have moved up significantly.",""
"2023-09-20","Q&A","I think it’s always hard to say precisely, but it’s—most, most people do a common decomposition of the increase, and they’ll, they’ll—the view will be, it’s not—it’s not mostly about inflation expectations.",""
"2023-09-20","Q&A","It’s mostly about other things, you know—either term premium or real yields— and it’s, it’s hard to be precise about this.",""
"2023-09-20","Q&A","Of course, everyone’s got models that’ll give you a very precise answer, but they give you different answers.",""

"2023-09-20","Q&A","of where inflation’s going in the near term,",""

"2023-11-01","Q&A","like the stronger dollar and lower equity prices—could matter for future rate decisions,",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","as long as two conditions are satisfied.",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","The first is that the tighter conditions would need to be persistent.",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","And that is something that remains to be seen.",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","Things are fluctuating back and forth—that’s not what we’re looking for.",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","With financial conditions, we’re looking for persistent changes that are material.",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","that the longer-term rates that have moved up—they can’t simply be a reflection of,",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","of expected policy moves from us that we would then—that if we didn’t follow through on them,",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","then the rates would come back down.",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","it does not appear that an expectation of higher near-term policy rates is causing the increase in longer-term rates.",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","perhaps the most important thing is that these higher Treasury yields are showing through to higher borrowing costs for households and businesses and those higher costs are going to weigh on economic activity to the extent this tightening persists and the mind’s eye goes to the 8 percent—near 8 percent mortgage rate,",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","You know, to say it a different way: We haven’t made any decisions about, about future meetings.",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","We have not made a determination, and we’re not—I will say that we’re not confident at this time that we’ve reached such a stance.",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","We’re not confident that we haven’t; we’re not confident that we have.",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","And that’s—that is—the way we’re going to be going into these future meetings is to be, you know, just determining the extent of any additional further policy tightening that may be appropriate to return inflation to 2 percent over time.",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","So, let me start by saying we haven’t made a decision about September.",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","You’re asking a hypothetical there.",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","But we’re going into December meeting—we’ll get,",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","two more labor market readings,",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","and so we’ll be taking—and also the broader situation,",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","the broader financial condition situation and broader world situation.",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","We’ll be looking at all those things as we make a decision in December.",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","We haven’t made that decision.",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","do what it thinks is appropriate at the time.",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","And, again, we haven’t made any decisions about— at all about December.",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","We didn’t even—we didn’t talk about making a decision in December today.",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","Really, it was a decision for this meeting and understanding broader things.",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","So I guess I don’t want to answer your question about the—about the recession.",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","But the answer is “no.” I think I have to answer it,",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","since we did publicly say in the minutes—you’ll know anyway in the [next] minutes—the staff did not put a recession back in.",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","it would be hard to see how you would do that if you look at the—look at the activity we’ve seen recently,",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","which is not really indicative of a recession in the near term.",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","In terms of how to think about translation into rate hikes,",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","I think it’s just too early to be doing that,",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","and the main reason is we just don’t know how persistent this will be.",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","You can see how volatile it is.",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","Different kinds of news will affect the level of rates,",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","and I think any kind of an estimate that was precise would hang out there and have a great chance of looking wrong very quickly.",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","So I think what we can say is that financial conditions have clearly tightened,",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","and you can see that in the rates that,",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","that consumers and households and businesses are paying now.",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","the way our policy works is—and sometimes it works with lags,",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","which can be long and variable,",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","And you see those effects in the economy now.",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","You see what’s happening in the housing market.",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","if you look at surveys of people,",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","it’s not a good time they think to buy durable goods of various kinds because rates are so high now.",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","we’re getting reports from housing that the effects of this—of this could be quite significant.",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","This has been a resilient economy.",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","And it’s, I think, been surprising in its resilience.",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","And there are a number of possible reasons why that may be.",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","Our job is to—is to achieve maximum employment and price stability,",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","and so we take the economy as it comes.",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","It has been resilient, so we just—we take it as it is.",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","it’s—the fact is the Committee is not thinking about rate cuts right now at all.",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","We’re not talking about rate cuts.",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","We’re still very focused on the first question,",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","have we achieved a stance of monetary policy that’s sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation down to 2 percent over time sustainably?",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","That is the question we’re focusing on.",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","The next question, as you know, will be, for how long will we remain restrictive?",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","And what we’ve said there is that we’ll keep policy restrictive until we’re confident that inflation is on a sustainable path down to 2 percent.",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","right now we’re really tightly focused on the first question.",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","The question of rate cuts just doesn’t come up because I think the first—it’s so important to get that first question,",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","there was a tightening bias in the Committee.",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","You say in the statement you’re looking to assess the appropriate stance of monetary policy,",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","the extent to which you may need to hike additionally.",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","You didn’t say earlier that you were sufficiently restrictive.",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","There were forecasts for two rate hikes among most members of the Committee.",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","But then you just said that, you know, we don’t—we haven’t made a determination.",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","Would you say the bias right now is neutral,",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","that there is no disposition to hike again and that the Committee largely has moved off of this forecast for two hikes?",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","I would say—I mean, the language, looking at it here, “In determining the extent of additional policy firming that may be appropriate to return inflation to 2 percent over time.” That’s the question we’re asking.",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","We haven’t used that term, but it’s fair to say that’s the question we’re asking is, should we hike more?",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","It’s not—it’s not, you know—that is the question, and you’re right that, in September, we wrote down one additional rate hike.",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","But, you know—and we’ll [each] write down another forecast, as you know, in December.",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","I wouldn’t say I was terribly surprised.",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","I was very impressed by York as a town with a real strategy.",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","And I would say it’s very impressive what the people there have put together in the face of,",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","some difficult longer-run trends about offshoring of manufacturing and that kind of thing.",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","They’ve done a great job as a city, I think.",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","what you hear—and it’s consistent there—which is people are really suffering under high inflation.",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","were feeling that in their businesses and other people who were feeling it in their home lives as well.",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","You know, it’s That wasn’t new.",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","But that did come through very clearly in,",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","in the conversations we had in York,",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","I walked away from that even—you know,",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","just thinking that we really—the best thing we can do for the",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","I think everyone has been very gratified to see that we’ve been able to achieve,",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","pretty significant progress on inflation without seeing the kind of increase in unemployment that has been very typical of rate hiking cycles like this one.",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","So that’s, that’s a historically unusual and very welcome result.",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","And the same is true of growth.",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","You know, we’ve been saying that we need to see below-potential growth.",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","And growth has been strong, but yet we’re still seeing this.",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","and my colleagues for the most part I think still believe,",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","It is still likely to be true—not a certainty—but likely that we will need to see some slower growth and some softening in the labor market—in labor market conditions to get,",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","to fully restore price stability.",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","So—but it’s only a good which is the unwinding of the distortions to both supply and demand [that arose] from the pandemic and the response to the pandemic.",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","which is moderating demand and giving the supply side time to recover—time and space to recover.",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","So you see those two forces now working together to bring down inflation.",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","But it’s that first one can bring down inflation without the need for higher unemployment or slower growth,",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","supply-side improvements like shortages and bottlenecks and that kind of thing going away.",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","a significant increase in the size of the labor market now,",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","both from labor force participation and from immigration.",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","gain that is really helping the economy,",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","and it’s part of why—part of why GDP is so high is because we’re getting that supply.",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","But I think those things will run their course,",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","and we’re probably still going to be left—we think,",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","and I think—we’ll still be left with some ground to cover to get back to full price stability.",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","And that’s where monetary policy and what we do with demand is still going to be important.",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","You know, I continue to think it’s very hard to say.",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","So it’s been one year at this meeting—one year ago,",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","this was the fourth of our 75 basis points hikes.",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","So that’s a full year since then.",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","I think we are seeing the effects of,",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","of all the hiking we did last year and this year—we’re seeing it.",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","It’s very hard to know exactly what that might be.",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","for are little things like that where the effects have just taken time to get into the economy.",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","So I don’t—I think we have to make monetary policy under great uncertainty about how long the lags are.",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","I think trying to make a clear—get a clear answer and say,",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","“I’m just going to assume this is really not a good way to do it.” And this is one of the reasons why we have slowed the process down this year,",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","was to give monetary policy time to get into the economy.",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","We know that, and you can’t rush it.",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","doing—slowing down is giving us,",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","of how much more we need to do,",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","Well so, let’s talk about the dot plot first.",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","So the dot plot is a picture in time of what the people in the Committee think is likely to be appropriate monetary policy in light of their own personal economic forecast.",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","planned that anybody’s agreed to or that we will do.",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","That’s a forecast that would change,",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","many things could change that would cause people to say,",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","“I period between that meeting and the next meeting.",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","But, nonetheless, it’s out there.",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","We don’t— we do personally update our forecast,",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","but we don’t formally update the dot plot.",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","I think we try to be as transparent as we can about the way we’re thinking about these things.",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","We’re laying out there our thinking,",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","we’ll all be— my colleagues and I will be talking about how we’re processing that data.",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","In terms of—so we’re not really changing the way—in terms of growth,",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","what I said was “below potential.” So what you have here recently is growth that is—that is temporarily— potential growth is elevated for a year or two right now over its trend level.",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","So the right way to think about it is, what’s potential growth this year?",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","People think trend growth over a long period of time is a little bit less than 2 percent,",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","or I would say just around 2 percent.",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","improvement in the size of the labor force,",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","through both participation and immigration,",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","the better functioning in the labor market and with the—with the,",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","the unwinding of the supply chain and shortages and those kinds of things,",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","you’re seeing actually elevated potential growth.",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","There’s catch-up growth that can happen in potential.",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","And that means that if you’re growing—you could be growing at 2 percent this year and still be growing below the increase in the potential output of the economy.",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","That’s really what’s going on.",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","That’s why I would say it as below potential.",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","I don’t know that I want to just accept anybody’s characterization,",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","but I’ll tell you how we’re doing this.",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","So, we’re going meeting by meeting.",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","We’re asking ourselves whether we’ve achieved a stance of policy that is sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation down to 2 percent over time.",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","That’s the question we’re asking.",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","We’re looking at the full range of economic data,",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","including financial conditions and all of those things that we look at,",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","we’ve come very far with this rate hiking cycle,",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","And you saw the spread at the September meeting of—you know,",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","it’s a relatively small spread of—people think one or two additional hikes.",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","So you’re close to the—to the end of the cycle.",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","That’s—that was an impression as of, I believe, as of September.",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","It’s not a promise or a plan of the future.",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","And so we’re going into these meetings one by one.",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","As I mentioned, we’re also—we’re being careful.",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","We’re proceeding carefully because we can proceed carefully at this time.",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","We see its effects, particularly in interest-sensitive spending and other channels.",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","So that’s how I think about it.",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","So, that proposal is out for comment.",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","And we expect a lot of comment.",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","We won’t get those comments until the end of, well, into next year.",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","You know, we’ve extended the deadline.",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","And we’ll take them seriously.",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","I’ll say what, what I do expect is that we will—we will come to a—we’re a consensus-driven organization.",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","We’ll come to a package that has broad support on the Board.",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","Banking stress—so it’s something we’re watching.",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","we did have—there were issues with interest rate risk and also funding uninsured deposits in the March—the things we went through in March and thereafter.",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","And so we’ve been working a lot with financial institutions to make sure that they have good funding plans and good—and that they have a plan for how to deal with the kind of portfolio,",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","And we do think the banking system is quite resilient.",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","a handful of bank failures but—so that’s,",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","that’s what we’re out there doing.",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","And we don’t have any reason to think that this—that these rate hikes are materially changing that picture,",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","which is one of a strong banking system and one where there’s a strong focus by banks and by supervisors on liquidity,",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","We put a proposal out for comment, is what we did.",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","this is a job that Congress assigned us,",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","and all we can really do is faithfully implement the statute.",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","That’s, that’s all we’re trying to do.",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","and we typically don’t comment on these things once they’re out for—out for comment.",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","And we do hope that stakeholders—and we know that they will use this opportunity to express their views.",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","They haven’t been shy about that.",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","So that’s, that’s critical and that’s, that’s what I can say about that now.",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","the progress is probably going to come in lumps and be bumpy,",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","I think the core PCE [inflation rate] came down by almost 60 basis points in the third quarter.",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","So the best thing I could point you to would be the September SEP where,",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","that inflation by the end of way inflation comes down.",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","as you get further and further from those highs,",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","it may actually take longer time.",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","But the good news is, you know, we’re making progress and monetary policy is restrictive.",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","And we feel like we’re on a path to make more progress,",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","and it’s essential that we do.",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","That’s always the question we’re asking ourselves.",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","if we fail to restore price stability,",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","the risk is that expectations of higher inflation get entrenched in the economy,",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","and we know that that’s really bad for people.",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","Inflation will be both more—both higher and more volatile.",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","That’s a—that’s a prescription for misery,",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","and so we’re really committed to not letting that happen.",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","for the first year or so of our tightening cycle,",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","the risk was all on the side of not doing enough.",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","we’re— we’ve come far enough that,",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","You can’t identify that with a lot of precision,",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","the risks are more two sided now.",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","And—but we’re committed to getting inflation back down to our target over time,",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","We haven’t really—we haven’t really been thinking about that yet.",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","We—you know, it’s November 1, and that’s a decision we’ll be making in the first quarter of next year.",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","We look at a range of, of things.",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","the UM thing got blown out of proportion a little bit.",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","It was actually a preliminary estimate that got revised away.",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","And I said it was preliminary in it, but that didn’t get picked up.",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","So we look at many, many things.",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","look across the broad array of surveys and also market-based estimates,",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","we do that really carefully at every meeting and between meetings.",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","And, you know, there’s—it’s just clear that inflation expectations are in a good place.",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","The public does believe that inflation will get back down to 2 percent over time,.",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","So—and there’s no real crack in that—in that armor.",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","You can always find one reading that is a little bit out of whack,",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","the bulk of them are just very clear that the public believes that inflation will come down.",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","And that’s, of course—we believe that’s critical in winning the battle.",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","So first thing to say is that it’s very important.",""

"2023-11-01","Q&A","within a range of estimates of the neutral rate policy,",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","and it’s therefore putting downward pressure on economic activity,",""

"2023-11-01","Q&A","We have to look—we have to have those models and look at them and think about them,",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","we’ve got to look at the effects that policy is having,",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","current level could be—could risk pushing up overall inflation or re-acceleration?",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","if you look at the—look at the broad range of wages,",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","they have— wage increases have really come down significantly over the course of the last 18 months to a level where they’re substantially closer to that level that would be consistent with 2 percent inflation over time,",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","making standard assumptions about productivity over time.",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","So it’s much closer than it was.",""

"2023-11-01","Q&A","It’s true of average hourly earnings and compensation per hour, too.",""

"2023-11-01","Q&A","you’ll see it was much higher,",""

"2023-11-01","Q&A","and it was very close to our expectations internally,",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","So I think we feel good about that.",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","Also I would say it isn’t—in my thinking,",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","that wages have been the principal driver of inflation so far,",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","although I think it’s all—I do think it’s fair to say that,",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","as monetary policy becomes more important relative to the supply-side issues I’ve talked about in the unwinding of the pandemic effects,",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","it may be that the labor market becomes more important over time,",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","I think for much of the last year and a half,",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","the concern was not doing too,",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","It was not getting rates high enough in time to avoid having inflation expectations—higher inflation expectations become entrenched.",""

"2023-11-01","Q&A","although we’re still—we’re still—we’re still trying to gain confidence in what the appropriate stance is.",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","We think, and I think, that the risks are getting more balanced.",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","I’ll just say that they’re getting more balanced.",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","The risk of doing too much versus the risk of doing too little are getting—are getting more— closer to balance,",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","because policy is I think clearly restrictive at 5¼ to 5½ percent.",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","if you take off a mainstream estimate of the expected inflation,",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","You’re going to see a real policy rate that is well above mainstream estimates of a neutral policy rate.",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","It doesn’t really—the proof is really in how the economy reacts,",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","but I would say that we’re in a place where those risks are getting closer to being in balance.",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","Well, I think what we’re looking at is are we still—is inflation still broadly cooling?",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","Do we—is it sort of validating the path we saw over the summer,",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","where inflation was clearly cooling and coming down.",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","Now we’ve seen periods like that before, and they’ve just—there hasn’t been follow-through.",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","So what are we demand, partly through just much more supply coming online.",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","And with labor demand still clearly remaining very strong—when you have the kind of job growth we’ve had over the last quarter,",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","it’s still very strong demand.",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","So—and you see wage increases coming down as we discussed but coming down in a kind of gradual way.",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","I think that’s—we want to see that, that whole set of processes continue.",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","I wouldn’t say there’s been a structural change in consumption.",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","I would say it’s certainly been strong.",""

"2023-11-01","Q&A","trying to estimate the number—the amount of savings that households have from the pandemic when they couldn’t spend on services really at all,",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","there can still be more of that than we think,",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","although at a certain point we have to—we’re going to be getting back to pre-pandemic levels of savings.",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","So things are—clearly, people are still spending.",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","The dynamic has been really strong job creation with now wages that are—that are higher than inflation,",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","and that raises real disposable income,",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","and that raises goods availability,",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","automobile availability is better—or was better,",""
"2023-11-01","Q&A","And, from a business standpoint, there are more people to hire.",""

"2023-12-13","Q&A","of strong demand but also of real gains on the supply side.",""
"2023-12-13","Q&A","So this was the year when labor force participation picked up,",""

"2023-12-13","Q&A","the shortages and the bottlenecks—really began to unwind.",""

"2023-12-13","Q&A","and it’s certainly a big part of—it’s a part of how we think about things.",""
"2023-12-13","Q&A","But, really, it’s broader financial conditions that matter.",""
"2023-12-13","Q&A","what the—what the real rate is or exactly how tight policy is at any given time.",""
"2023-12-13","Q&A","So you couldn’t follow that like it was a rule and think that you would get the right answer all the time,",""
"2023-12-13","Q&A","but it’s certainly something that we’re focused on.",""
"2023-12-13","Q&A","if you look at the projections,",""
"2023-12-13","Q&A","I think the expectation would be that the real rate is declining as we—as we move forward.",""
"2023-12-13","Q&A","No, we—we’re—we don’t think about political events.",""
"2023-12-13","Q&A","We don’t think about politics.",""
"2023-12-13","Q&A","We think about what’s the right thing to do for the economy.",""
"2023-12-13","Q&A","The minute we start thinking about those things—you know, we just can’t do that.",""
"2023-12-13","Q&A","We have to think, what’s the right thing?",""
"2023-12-13","Q&A","We’ll do the things that we think are right for the economy at the time we—when we think is the right time.",""
"2023-12-13","Q&A","So I mentioned we’re moving carefully.",""
"2023-12-13","Q&A","One of the things we’re moving carefully about is that decision over—that assessment,",""
"2023-12-13","Q&A","And you see that people are not writing down rate hikes.",""
"2023-12-13","Q&A","that’s us thinking that we have done enough but not,",""
"2023-12-13","Q&A","not feeling that really strongly,",""
"2023-12-13","Q&A","confidently and not wanting to approaching things.",""
"2023-12-13","Q&A","and it talks about—people have individual assessments of when it will be appropriate to,",""
"2023-12-13","Q&A","on the tight policy we have in place,",""
"2023-12-13","Q&A","and that’s a discussion we’ll be having going forward.",""
"2023-12-13","Q&A","But that’s another assessment that we’re going to make very carefully,",""
"2023-12-13","Q&A","So this last year has been remarkable for the,",""
"2023-12-13","Q&A","the back-and-forth we’ve had over the course of the year of markets moving away and moving back and that kind of thing.",""
"2023-12-13","Q&A","and what I would just say is that we,",""
"2023-12-13","Q&A","we focus on what we have to do and how we need to use our tools to achieve our goals,",""
"2023-12-13","Q&A","and that’s what we really focus on.",""
"2023-12-13","Q&A","And people are going to have different forecasts about the economy,",""
"2023-12-13","Q&A","and they’re going to—those are going to show up in market conditions,",""
"2023-12-13","Q&A","But in any case, we have to do what we think is right.",""
"2023-12-13","Q&A","it’s important that financial conditions become aligned or are aligned with what we’re trying to accomplish,",""
"2023-12-13","Q&A","I’m just focused on what’s the right thing for us to do.",""
"2023-12-13","Q&A","And my colleagues are focused on that, too.",""
"2023-12-13","Q&A","Listen, I welcome the progress.",""
"2023-12-13","Q&A","I think it’s, it’s really good to see the progress that we’re making.",""
"2023-12-13","Q&A","I think if you look at the 12-month—look at the 6-month measures,",""
"2023-12-13","Q&A","If you look at 12-month measures, you’re still well above 2 percent.",""
"2023-12-13","Q&A","You’re actually above 3 percent on core, through November, PCE [inflation].",""
"2023-12-13","Q&A","That isn’t to say— I’m not, you know, calling into question the progress.",""
"2023-12-13","Q&A","further progress toward getting back to 2 percent.",""
"2023-12-13","Q&A","That’s, that’s what we need to see.",""
"2023-12-13","Q&A","So, you know, our—it’s our job to restore price stability.",""
"2023-12-13","Q&A","And that—it’s one of our two jobs, along with maximum employment, and they’re equal.",""
"2023-12-13","Q&A","So we’re very focused on, on, you know, doing that.",""
"2023-12-13","Q&A","As I mentioned, we’re moving carefully at this point.",""
"2023-12-13","Q&A","We’re pleased with the progress,",""
"2023-12-13","Q&A","but we see the need for further progress,",""
"2023-12-13","Q&A","and I think—I think it’s fair to say there is a lot of uncertainty about going forward.",""
"2023-12-13","Q&A","We’ve seen the economy move in surprising directions,",""
"2023-12-13","Q&A","so we’re just going to need to see more further progress.",""
"2023-12-13","Q&A","So we’ll, we’ll look at the totality of the data.",""
"2023-12-13","Q&A","Growth is one thing, so is inflation, so is labor market data.",""
"2023-12-13","Q&A","So we’d, we’d look at the totality.",""
"2023-12-13","Q&A","As we—as we make decisions about policy changes going forward,",""
"2023-12-13","Q&A","we’re going to be looking at all those things and,",""
"2023-12-13","Q&A","about the—as they affect the outlook.",""
"2023-12-13","Q&A","So it’s ultimately all about the outlook and the balance of risks as well.",""
"2023-12-13","Q&A","So that’s what—that’s what we’d be looking for.",""
"2023-12-13","Q&A","If we have stronger growth, you know, that’ll be good for people.",""
"2023-12-13","Q&A","That’ll be good for the labor market.",""
"2023-12-13","Q&A","It might actually mean that it takes a little longer to get inflation down to 2 percent.",""
"2023-12-13","Q&A","We will get it down to 2 percent,",""
"2023-12-13","Q&A","we’ll—we will set policy according to what we actually see.",""
"2023-12-13","Q&A","And, and so that’s how I would answer.",""
"2023-12-13","Q&A","It’s only a problem inso—it’s not itself a problem.",""
"2023-12-13","Q&A","It’s only a problem insofar as it makes it more difficult for us to achieve our goals.",""
"2023-12-13","Q&A","if you have—if you have growth that’s robust,",""
"2023-12-13","Q&A","what that will mean is probably it will keep the labor market very strong.",""
"2023-12-13","Q&A","It probably will, will place some upward pressure on inflation.",""
"2023-12-13","Q&A","That could mean that it takes longer to get to 2 percent inflation.",""
"2023-12-13","Q&A","That could mean we need to keep rates higher for longer.",""
"2023-12-13","Q&A","It could even mean, ultimately, that we would need to hike again.",""
"2023-12-13","Q&A","It just is— it’s the way, the way our policy works.",""
"2023-12-13","Q&A","So on, on the better-balance side, there are just a lot of things.",""
"2023-12-13","Q&A","It’s— you see—you see job growth still strong but moving back down to more sustainable levels,",""
"2023-12-13","Q&A","given population growth and labor force participation.",""
"2023-12-13","Q&A","The things that are not quite—but let me go on with that list.",""
"2023-12-13","Q&A","If you look at surveys of businesses,",""
"2023-12-13","Q&A","they’re— sort of the era of this frantic labor shortage,",""
"2023-12-13","Q&A","[those kinds of worker shortages] are behind us,",""
"2023-12-13","Q&A","and they’re seeing a shortage of labor as being significantly alleviated.",""
"2023-12-13","Q&A","If you look at shortages of workers,",""
"2023-12-13","Q&A","job availability was the highest that it’d ever been or close to it,",""
"2023-12-13","Q&A","that’s now down to more normal levels by so many measures—participation,",""
"2023-12-13","Q&A","So wages are still running a bit above what would be consistent with 2 percent inflation over a long period of time.",""
"2023-12-13","Q&A","They’ve been gradually cooling off.",""
"2023-12-13","Q&A","But if wages are running around 4 percent,",""
"2023-12-13","Q&A","there are just a couple of other—the unemployment rate is very,",""
"2023-12-13","Q&A","the development of the labor market has been very positive.",""
"2023-12-13","Q&A","It’s been a good time for workers to find jobs and get solid wage increases.",""
"2023-12-13","Q&A","while inflation is coming down,",""
"2023-12-13","Q&A","the price level is not coming down.",""
"2023-12-13","Q&A","Prices of some, some goods and services are coming down.",""
"2023-12-13","Q&A","But overall, in the aggregate, the price level is not.",""
"2023-12-13","Q&A","So people are still living with high prices,",""
"2023-12-13","Q&A","that’s not—that is something that people don’t like.",""
"2023-12-13","Q&A","so what will happen with that is,",""
"2023-12-13","Q&A","wages are now—[changes in] real wages are now positive.",""
"2023-12-13","Q&A","So [nominal] wages are now moving up more than inflation, as inflation comes down.",""
"2023-12-13","Q&A","And so that might help improve the mood of people.",""
"2023-12-13","Q&A","But we do see those—we see those public opinion surveys.",""
"2023-12-13","Q&A","The thing that we can do is to do our jobs,",""
"2023-12-13","Q&A","which is to use our tools to foster price stability,",""
"2023-12-13","Q&A","which has such great benefits over such long periods of time,",""
"2023-12-13","Q&A","and which is the thing that really enables us to work for and achieve an extended period of high employment,",""
"2023-12-13","Q&A","and companies around the country.",""
"2023-12-13","Q&A","You know, obviously, what we’ll do is we’ll look at the totality of the data, as I’ve mentioned a couple times, and, certainly, the labor data would be important in that.",""
"2023-12-13","Q&A","And, you know, if you—if you can describe a situation like that where if, if there were the beginning of a recession or something like that, then, yes, that would certainly weigh heavily on that decision.",""
"2023-12-13","Q&A","So we’re, we’re aware of the risk that we would hang on too long.",""
"2023-12-13","Q&A","and we’re very focused on not making that mistake.",""
"2023-12-13","Q&A","And we do regard the two—you know,",""
"2023-12-13","Q&A","we’ve come back into a better balance between the risk of overdoing it and the risk of underdoing it.",""
"2023-12-13","Q&A","Not only that, we were able to focus hard on the—on the price-stability mandate.",""
"2023-12-13","Q&A","And we’re getting back to the point where—which is what you do So I think we’ll be—we’ll be very much keeping that in mind,",""
"2023-12-13","Q&A","as we make policy going forward.",""
"2023-12-13","Q&A","And the things we’ll be looking at, I’ve already described.",""
"2023-12-13","Q&A","we’re obviously looking hard at what’s happening with demand,",""
"2023-12-13","Q&A","We see the same thing other people see,",""
"2023-12-13","Q&A","which really put up quite a performance in 2023.",""
"2023-12-13","Q&A","We see good evidence and good reason to believe that growth will come in lower next year.",""
"2023-12-13","Q&A","And you see what the forecasts are.",""
"2023-12-13","Q&A","I think the median growth—median participant wrote down 1.4 percent growth,",""
"2023-12-13","Q&A","We’ll also be looking to see progress on inflation and,",""
"2023-12-13","Q&A","the labor market remaining strong but,",""
"2023-12-13","Q&A","without seeing the kind of large increase in unemployment that happens sometimes.",""
"2023-12-13","Q&A","We haven’t typically tried to articulate, with one exception, really specific target levels, which was if you—some of you will remember the thresholds that we used in, I guess, 2013.",""
"2023-12-13","Q&A","I don’t—the answer is, these are things that we haven’t, you know, really worked out yet.",""
"2023-12-13","Q&A","We’re sort of just at the beginning of, of that discussion.",""
"2023-12-13","Q&A","Well, that’s what we’re finding out, and we’ve, you know, we’ve seen real progress in, in core inflation.",""
"2023-12-13","Q&A","It has been sticky, and famously, the service sector is thought to be stickier, but we’ve actually seen reasonable progress in nonhousing services, which was the area where, where you would expect to see less progress.",""
"2023-12-13","Q&A","We are seeing some progress there, though.",""
"2023-12-13","Q&A","And, in fact, all three of the categories of core [prices] are now contributing: goods, housing services, nonhousing services.",""
"2023-12-13","Q&A","They’re all contributing in different—at different levels, you know, meeting by meeting—or, rather, report by report.",""
"2023-12-13","Q&A","The question of whether there have been fundamental structural shifts is,",""
"2023-12-13","Q&A","is really hard to know the answer and a very interesting one right now.",""
"2023-12-13","Q&A","The one that would affect—the one that comes to mind,",""
"2023-12-13","Q&A","is just the question of where the neutral rate of interest is.",""
"2023-12-13","Q&A","and I’m not saying that it has,",""
"2023-12-13","Q&A","that interest rates would need to be a little bit higher to convey the same level of restriction.",""
"2023-12-13","Q&A","The thing is, we’re not really going to know that.",""
"2023-12-13","Q&A","people will be writing papers about that 10 years from now and still fighting about it.",""
"2023-12-13","Q&A","So it’s just that it’s going to be uncertain.",""
"2023-12-13","Q&A","So we’re going to be making policy in this,",""
"2023-12-13","Q&A","Some—someone once said that you know the—you know the natural rate of interest by its works,",""
"2023-12-13","Q&A","but that’s very difficult because policy And,",""
"2023-12-13","Q&A","we really slowed down a lot to give those lags time to work.",""
"2023-12-13","Q&A","In terms of demand, has demand shifted more away from services into goods?",""
"2023-12-13","Q&A","There’s— you can make a case for that,",""
"2023-12-13","Q&A","that the shift back into services has not been complete,",""
"2023-12-13","Q&A","and it doesn’t look like it’s ongoing,",""
"2023-12-13","Q&A","but I don’t know if that’s right.",""
"2023-12-13","Q&A","Maybe people just bought so much stuff that they temporarily don’t want any more stuff.",""
"2023-12-13","Q&A","They haven’t got anyplace to put it.",""
"2023-12-13","Q&A","the reason you wouldn’t wait to get to 2 percent to cut rates is that policy would be,",""
"2023-12-13","Q&A","you’d want to be reducing restriction on the economy well before 2 percent because—or before you get to 2 percent so you don’t overshoot,",""
"2023-12-13","Q&A","think of restrictive policy as weighing on economic activity.",""
"2023-12-13","Q&A","it takes—it takes a while for policy to get into the economy,",""
"2023-12-13","Q&A","So I can’t give you a precise answer.",""
"2023-12-13","Q&A","But if you look at what’s in the—in the SEP,",""
"2023-12-13","Q&A","I think you’ll see a reasonable estimate of the time lags and things like that that it would take.",""
"2023-12-13","Q&A","because I would be able to look back then and probably find out that it turned out not to be right.",""
"2023-12-13","Q&A","But we’ll be looking at it and, and looking at the broad collection of factors.",""
"2023-12-13","Q&A","You know, we felt since the beginning that it would be a combination of two factors.",""
"2023-12-13","Q&A","The first factor is just the unwinding of, of what happened in the pandemic: the distortions of supply and demand.",""
"2023-12-13","Q&A","And the second thing would be our policy, which was weighing on aggregate demand and actually making it easier for the supply side to recover because of lower demand.",""
"2023-12-13","Q&A","We thought those two things were going to be necessary.",""
"2023-12-13","Q&A","Sorry, say your—say the last part of your question again.",""
"2023-12-13","Q&A","So it’s not that—it may or may not be about “different,” the",""
"2023-12-13","Q&A","So I think they’re, they’re on independent tracks.",""
"2023-12-13","Q&A","You’re asking, though, the question, I guess you’re implying the question of can you continue with QT at such time—QT, which is a tightening action—at such time as policy is still tight?",""
"2023-12-13","Q&A","And the answer is, economy is really weak.",""

"2024-01-31","Q&A","so we can actually rely on more,",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","and the economy has largely reopened and is broadly normalizing,",""

"2024-01-31","Q&A","that sort of more innovative data as much.",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","So, of course, we follow the, the components of inflation very carefully.",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","Which would be: Goods inflation—I talked about that a little bit; you mentioned housing inflation.",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","when will these lower market rents find their way into measured rents,",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","And we think that’s coming, and we know it’s coming.",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","It’s just a question of when and, and how big it’ll be.",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","So—but that’s in, in everyone’s forecast, I would say.",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","we think goods inflation will probably—it’s been giving a lot of disinflation to the effort—and probably that declines over time,",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","We’ll find out with, with that.",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","So we look at the things that relate to our mandate very carefully,",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","No, I wouldn’t—I wouldn’t say we’ve achieved that.",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","And I, I think we have—we have a ways to go.",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","Inflation is still—you know, core inflation is still well above target on a 12-month basis.",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","Twelve months is our, our target, certainly.",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","I’m encouraged, and we’re encouraged by the progress.",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","But, you know, we’re, we’re not—we’re not declaring victory at all at this point.",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","We think we have a ways to go.",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","you do see in the interest-sensitive parts of the economy—you do see,",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","a lot of this has come through—a lot of the disinflationary process has come through the healing of supply chains and also of the labor market.",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","that other set of factors is really different from other really do think that we’re having an effect broadly across the economy.",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","I would point to the interest-sensitive parts of the economy as well as spending, generally.",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","But it’s a—it’s a joint story.",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","you know that it’s not something you can identify with any precision.",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","But if you—a standard approach would be to take the nominal rate—5.3 percent,",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","let’s say—and subtract sort of a,",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","a forward measure of inflation.",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","If you do that—and there are many,",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","many ways to calculate the neutral rate—but that’s one I like to do.",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","you’re going to get to something that is materially above mainstream estimates of neutrality—of the neutral rate—you will.",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","“This is an economy that grew 3.1 percent last year.” And,",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","“What does that tell you about the neutral rate?” What’s happening,",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","the supply side has been recovering in the middle of this.",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","So that, that won’t go on forever.",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","So a lot of the growth we’re seeing is not—is—it isn’t just a tug of war between,",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","between interest rates and demand.",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","more activity because of the—of labor market healing and supply chains healing.",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","the restriction will show up probably more,",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","I think the labor market by many measures is at or nearing normal—but not totally back to normal.",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","And you pointed to one or more of them.",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","So I think, you know, job openings are not quite back to where they were.",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","are not quite back to where they—to where they would need to be in the longer run.",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","I, I would look at it this way, though.",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","The, the economy is broadly normalizing, and so is the labor market.",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","And that process will probably take some time.",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","So wage setting is something that happens—it’s,",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","probably will take a couple of years to get all the way back.",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","But we do see—you saw today’s ECI reading—you know,",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","that wage increases are still at a healthy level—very healthy level—but they’re gradually moving back to levels that would be more associated—given,",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","are more typically associated with 2 percent inflation.",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","it’s an ongoing process—a healthy one— and,",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","we’re moving in the right direction.",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","I think the, the labor market is—it—I don’t know if I’d—it’s rebalancing.",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","that the—there was a fairly severe imbalance between demand for workers and supply at the beginning of the pandemic.",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","So we lost several million workers at the beginning of the pandemic from people dropping out of the labor force.",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","And then when the economy reopened—you remember 2021—you had a severe labor shortage,",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","And 2022 was a disappointing year,",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","maybe we won’t get it back.” And then 2023,",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","as you know—so labor force participation came back strongly in ’23,",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","Immigration came to a halt during the pandemic.",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","So—and so those two forces have significantly lowered the temperature in the labor market to what is still a very strong labor market.",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","It’s still a good labor market for wages and for finding a job,",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","but it’s getting back into balance,",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","and that’s what we want to see.",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","one great way to look at that is what’s happening with,",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","And you see it now across the, the major things that we—that we track.",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","there’s a clear trend—still at high levels,",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","but back down to where—what would be consistent with,",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","with where we were before the pandemic and with 2 percent inflation.",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","No, I think that that is a risk—the risk that inflation would, would reaccelerate.",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","the greater risk is that it would—that it would stabilize at a level meaningfully above 2 percent.",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","That’s, that’s, to me, more likely.",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","if—if inflation were to surprise by moving back up,",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","that would—we would have to respond to that,",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","and that would— more likely risk is the one that I mentioned,",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","you’ve had six good months—very good months—but what,",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","what’s really going to “shake out” here?",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","You know, where—what will— when we look back, what will we see?",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","Will, will inflation have dipped and then come back up?",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","Are the last six months flattered by factors that are—that are one-off factors that won’t repeat themselves?",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","We don’t—you know, that’s not what we think, but that’s the question we are asking.",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","We have to ask [that], and we want to get comfort on that.",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","Last year was a—was a, a surprise.",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","So we—the thing is, we’re not looking for inflation to tap the 2 percent base once.",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","We’re looking for it to settle out over time at 2 percent.",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","And the same thing is true if we have a month or two of lower—and we have that now—of, of inflation that’s annualized at a—at a lower level—that wouldn’t be good.",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","We’re not—you know, we’re not looking to have inflation anchor below 2 percent.",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","We’re looking to have it anchor at 2 percent.",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","the job on inflation while keeping the labor market strong.",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","So I’ll point you to that language on your first question.",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","we included that language in the statement to signal clearly that—with strong growth,",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","inflation coming down—the Committee intends to move carefully as we consider when to begin to dial back the restrictive stance that we have in place.",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","So if you take that to the current context—current context,",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","we’re going to be data dependent.",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","We’re going to be looking at this meeting by meeting.",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","I would tell you that I don’t think it’s likely that the Committee will reach a level of confidence by the time of the March meeting to identify March as the time to do that.",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","But that’s, that’s to be seen.",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","when you say—when you ask me about “in the near term,” I’m hearing that as March.",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","I would say I don’t think that’s—that’s,",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","that’s probably not the most likely case or what we would call the base case.",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","So this is a really interesting question.",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","my own view is—I think if you look,",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","you saw a spike in productivity as workers were laid off,",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","and activity didn’t decline as fast.",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","And then you saw a deep trough will be,",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","what is it that has changed the—you know,",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","the productivity tends to be based on,",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","fundamental aspects of our economy.",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","Is there—is there a case—will it be the case that we come out of this more productive on a sustained basis?",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","but I would—my guess is that we may shake out and be back where we were,",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","because I don’t—I’m not sure I see—work from home doesn’t seem like it’s a big productivity increase.",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","artificial intelligence— generative it may be,",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","but probably not in the short run—probably,",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","So I’m not—I’m not seeing why it would,",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","right now I would say that productivity is kind of what falls out of the,",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","the broader forces that are driving people in and out of the labor force and,",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","and activity returning and supply chains getting fixed.",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","our statutory goals are maximum employment and price stability,",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","and that’s what we’re targeting.",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","We’re not targeting housing price inflation, the cost of housing, or any of those things.",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","Those are very important housing, housing industry was helped more than any other industry.",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","the housing industry can be hurt,",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","because it’s a very interest-sensitive sector.",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","On top of that, we have longer-run problems with the availability of housing.",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","people are moving further and further out.",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","So there’s—there hasn’t been enough housing built.",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","And these are not—these are not things that we have any tools to address.",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","where it comes into play very specifically in our work is inflation,",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","It’s, it’s really rental inflation.",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","You’re taking owners’ equivalent rent and then actual rent paid by tenants.",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","And you’re, you’re running that through the CPI calculation.",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","Or the PCE [inflation] calculation—the one we look at.",""

"2024-01-31","Q&A","It has to as long as that remains the case.",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","My response is what I started with,",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","our job—the job Congress has given us is price stability and maximum employment.",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","Price stability is absolutely essential for people’s lives,",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","mostly for people at the lower end of the income spectrum who are living at the edges—at the margins.",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","And so someone—for someone like that,",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","high inflation in the—in the necessities of life—right away,",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","whereas even middle-class people have some,",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","some scope to absorb higher costs.",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","So we have to get—it’s our job.",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","So I would start by saying that balance sheet runoff so far has gone very well.",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","And as the process has continued,",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","we’re getting to that time where questions are beginning to come into greater focus about the pace of runoff and all that.",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","we did have some discussion of the balance sheet,",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","and we’re planning to begin in- depth discussions of balance sheet issues at our next meeting in March.",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","So those, those questions are all coming into scope now, and we’re focusing on them.",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","But we’re, we’re at the beginning of that process, I would say.",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","Yes, we do—we see those as independent tools.",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","And so they don’t—for example,",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","if you’re—if you’re normalizing policy,",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","you might be reducing rates but continuing to run off the balance sheet.",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","but from a strict monetary policy standpoint,",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","you could say we’re loosening along with tightening.",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","It’s not something we’re planning or thinking about,",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","we’re thinking about getting to a place where—we’re going to see the balance sheet runoff to continue.",""

"2024-01-31","Q&A","I’m, I’m not in a position to put a number on it.",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","I’m just going to say—and it’s not that we don’t have any confidence.",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","but not to the point where we—where we feel like—it’s a highly consequential decision to start the process of,",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","of dialing back on restriction.",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","And we want to get that right,",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","and we feel like the strong economy,",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","inflation coming down—it gives us the ability to do that.",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","We think that’s the best way we can serve the public,",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","we’ve made a lot of progress on inflation.",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","We just want to make sure that we do get the job done in a sustainable way.",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","That’s how we’re thinking about it.",""

"2024-01-31","Q&A","We have—this year is going to be a highly consequential year for, for the Fed and for monetary policy.",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","And we’re, all of us, very buckled down, focused on doing our jobs.",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","I think if we—if we came to the view that,",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","that inflation were—that the six-month inflation numbers,",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","which are very close to 2 [percent],",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","in “PCE world”—if we came to—if that’s—if we thought that is really where we’re going to be,",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","our policy would be in a different place.",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","But, you know, that’s the whole point is, we’re trying to get comfortable and gain confidence that that is where—that inflation is on a sustainable path down to 2 percent or toward 2 percent.",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","so it’s been—it’s been interesting that confidence surveys have been weak,",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","at a time when unemployment has been low—very low,",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","historically low—for a couple of years.",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","And—but, nonetheless, that’s been the case.",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","And we’ve asked ourselves why that is.",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","one obvious answer—we don’t pretend to have perfect wisdom on this—is—but one obvious answer is that the price level is high.",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","So prices went up much more than 2 percent for year—per year for a couple of years.",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","And people are going to the store,",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","and they’re paying much more for the basics of life than they were two years ago—three years ago.",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","And they’re not happy about it.",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","And it’s fine that inflation is coming down,",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","but the price—the prices they’re paying are still high.",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","that has to be some part of why people are unhappy.",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","And they’re, they’re right to be unhappy.",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","You know, this is why we need to keep price stability.",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","It’s why we need to do our jobs—so that people don’t have to deal with things like this.",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","In terms of [surveys]—you’re right.",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","a couple of—you’ve seen a couple of significant increases in,",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","or happiness with the economy.",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","That can—that can support spending—can support economic activity.",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","There’s some evidence of that.",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","But it is—it is a fact that we have seen, you know, a meaningful increase.",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","I think levels of confidence are still maybe not as high as they’ve been at various times.",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","But it’s—they certainly have come up.",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","I’m, I’m a big believer that—yes.",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","we do meet with outside groups who come from all different parts of the economy.",""

"2024-01-31","Q&A","I spent most of my life in the private sector looking at companies—individual companies—individual management teams—and then building out from that.",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","starting with GDP data is—and working into what’s actually affecting people’s lives is—is challenging.",""

"2024-01-31","Q&A","we’ve had inflation come down without a slow economy and without,",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","and there’s no reason why we should want to get in the way of that process,",""
"2024-01-31","Q&A","I think—I think declining inflation—continued declines in inflation are,",""

"2024-03-20","Q&A","And the inflation data came in a little bit higher is a separate matter, and I think that caused people to write up their inflation.",""

"2024-03-20","Q&A","And we’re committed to that outcome, and we will bring it about.",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","So I think there’s some confidence that the market rents—lower market rent increases that we’re seeing will show up in measures of housing services inflation over time.",""

"2024-03-20","Q&A","if we ease—if we ease too much or too soon,",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","we could see inflation come back,",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","we could do unnecessary harm to employment and people’s working lives.",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","And so, you know, we do see the risks as two-sided, so it is consequential.",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","and with inflation coming down,",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","we can approach that question carefully and let the data speak on that.",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","That’s really what I was thinking.",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","I want to start by being—saying I always try to be careful about dismissing data that we don’t like.",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","So you need to check yourself on that, and I’ll do that.",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","But— so I would say the January number,",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","which was very high—the January CPI and PCE numbers were quite high.",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","There’s reason to think that there could be seasonal effects there.",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","But, nonetheless, we don’t want to be completely dismissive of it.",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","but we have it at currently well below 30 basis points core PCE,",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","So it’s not like the January number.",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","But I take the two of them together,",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","and I think they haven’t really changed the overall story,",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","which is that of inflation moving down gradually on a sometimes-bumpy road toward 2 percent.",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","I don’t think that story has changed.",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","I the good inflation readings we got in the last seven months of last year.",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","We didn’t take too much signal out of that.",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","What you heard us saying was that we needed to see more that we could,",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","you know—we wanted to be careful about that decision,",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","and we’re not going to overreact,",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","nor are we going to ignore them.",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","So we make decisions meeting by meeting.",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","And we didn’t make any decisions about future meetings today.",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","Those are going to depend on our ongoing assessment of the incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks.",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","So I really don’t have anything for you on any specific meeting, looking forward.",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","We’ll take—you know, things can happen during an intermeeting period, if you look back—unexpected things.",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","So I don’t want to—I wouldn’t want to dismiss anything.",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","So I just would say that the Committee wants to see more data that gives us higher confidence that inflation is moving down sustainably toward 2 percent.",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","I also mentioned—and we don’t see this in the data right now,",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","but if there were a significant weakening in the data,",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","particularly in the labor market,",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","that could also be a reason for us to begin the process of meeting.",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","They’re pretty modest changes, but you’re right.",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","There was an uptick in the longer-run rate,",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","and also there’s a 25 basis point increase in ’25 and ’26.",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","are rates going to be higher in the longer run,",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","if that’s really your question,",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","it’s—we think that rates were generally low during the pre-pandemic post–Global Financial Crisis era for reasons that are mostly,",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","large things like demographics and productivity and that sort of thing—things that don’t move quickly.",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","my instinct would be that rates will not go back down to the very low levels that we saw,",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","there were long- run [real interest] rates that were at or below zero in some cases.",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","I don’t see rates going back down to that level.",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","But I think there’s tremendous uncertainty around that.",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","I think that that higher year-end number reflects the data we’ve seen so far this year because you’re now—you’re now in this year.",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","So I think that—sorry, say your last part of your question again.",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","what it says is that it is still likely in most people’s view that we will achieve that confidence and that there will be rate cuts.",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","But that’s really going to depend on the incoming data.",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","in the second half of the year,",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","you have some pretty low readings,",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","so it might be harder to make progress as you move that 12-month window forward.",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","we’re looking for data that confirm the kind of low readings that we had last year and give us a higher degree of confidence that what we saw was really inflation moving sustainably down to 2 percent—toward 2 percent.",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","if what we’re getting is a lot of supply and a lot of demand,",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","and that supply is actually feeding demand because workers are getting paid and they’re spending and that’s,",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","you know—what you would have is potentially kind of what you had last last year with—both with supply chains and also with,",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","with growth in the size of the labor force.",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","I mean, we saw—you saw last year very strong hiring and inflation coming down quickly.",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","We now have a better sense that a big part of that was supply-side healing, particularly with, with growth in the labor force.",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","So, in and of itself, strong job growth is not a reason, you know, for us to be concerned about inflation.",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","So we think—there are many different financial conditions indicators,",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","see different answers to that question.",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","we do think that financial conditions are weighing on economic activity,",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","and we think you see that in—a great place to see it is in the labor market,",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","where you’ve seen demand cooling off a little bit from the extremely high levels.",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","And there I would point to job openings, quits, surveys, the hiring rate.",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","Things like that are really demand.",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","There are also supply-side things happening, but I think those are demand-side things happening.",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","You know, we saw—that’s been a question for a while.",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","We did see progress on inflation last year—significant progress,",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","despite financial conditions sometimes being tighter,",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","give us more color on how the Committee is thinking about inflation dynamics now?",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","What we’ve seen at the beginning of the year,",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","are they more one-off increases that will fade,",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","or is there more of a secular turn with goods prices rising again and service prices staying sticky?",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","And also housing prices have been sort of the Godot of this cycle,",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","in that you keep expecting them to go down,",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","How does the Committee see this playing out forward, since you’ve raised your inflation forecast?",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","So I see the Committee looking at the two months of data and asking the same question you’re asking and saying we’re just going to have to see what the data show.",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","which is a very high reading and you can—and I think many people did see the possibility of seasonal adjustment problems there.",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","you don’t want to—you’ve got to be careful about dismissing the parts of the data that you don’t like.",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","So then February wasn’t, wasn’t as high, but it was higher.",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","So the question is, what are we going to see?",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","we tend to see a little bit stronger—this is in the data—a little bit stronger inflation in the first half of the year,",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","a little bit less strong later in the year.",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","We’re going to— we’re going to let the data show.",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","I don’t think we really know whether this is a bump on the road or something more.",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","and that gives us the ability to approach this question carefully and feel more confident that inflation is moving down sustainably at 2 percent when we take that step to begin dialing back our restrictive policy.",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","dented that confidence at all?",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","It certainly hasn’t improved our confidence—it hasn’t raised anyone’s confidence.",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","But I would say that the story is really essentially the same and that is of inflation coming down gradually toward 2 percent on a sometimes-bumpy path,",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","I think that’s what you still see.",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","We’ve got nine months of 2½ percent inflation now,",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","and we’ve had two months of kind of bumpy inflation.",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","We were saying that we’ll—it’s going to be a bumpy ride.",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","Now here are some bumps, and the question is, are they more than bumps?",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","And we just don’t—we can’t know that.",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","That’s why we are approaching this question carefully.",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","It is very important for everyone that we serve that we do get inflation sustainably down.",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","And I think the historical record,",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","but the historical record is that you need to approach that question carefully and try to get it right the first time and not have to come back and raise rates again perhaps if you cut inappropriately— prematurely.",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","We receive these letters with respect, and we write careful responses and address concerns.",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","We listen, again, because we’re talking to the people who, in our system of government, have oversight over our activity.",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","So that’s—but at the end of the day,",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","we take that on board,",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","but we have to make our judgments,",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","and we have to “stick to our knitting”— which is maximum employment,",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","supervise and regulate the banks,",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","work on the payment system: the things that we do.",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","We’re a very consensus-oriented organization, and we do try to achieve consensus and, ideally, unanimity.",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","Life goes on, and it’s not a problem.",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","But—and so I—you know, you respect thoughtful dissents very much.",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","It’s like, you may not agree with some arguments, but you really want to understand them.",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","So you may read a book that takes a position that you have long opposed, just to understand [the position of] that book.",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","So I treat dissents with real respect as well.",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","So we, of course, monitor—it’s one of our two goal variables.",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","We all monitor the labor market very, very carefully.",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","And I don’t see those cracks today.",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","you know—we follow all the possible stories that are out there about,",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","but the overall picture really is a strong labor market.",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","The extreme imbalances that we saw in the gradually moderating down to more sustainable levels.",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","the things are returning more to their state in 2019,",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","which we can think of as normal for this purpose.",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","That’s job openings and quits.",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","And surveys of workers and businesses are always interesting on this:",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","how tight is the—how easy is it to find a job?",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","How hard is it—how easy it is to find a worker?",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","Those have both—those surveys have both come down.",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","So the labor market is—it’s in good shape.",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","you do see things like the low— the low hiring rate,",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","and people have made the argument that if,",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","that would—that would mean that the net would be fairly quick increases in unemployment.",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","So that’s something we’re watching, but we’re not seeing it.",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","have tracked down a little bit.",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","And when I say something—I, I use the term “unexpected” weakening of the labor market.",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","we do expect the unemployment rate to—the forecast is that it would move up,",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","closer to what we see as the longer-run sustainable level.",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","That’s just—that’s just people’s forecast, individual forecasts.",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","But we’re talking about something that’s unexpected.",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","That’s where I’ll leave it, though.",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","So that is what we’re discussing essentially is—and we’re not discussing all the other many other balance sheet issues.",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","We will discuss those in due course.",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","But what we’re really looking at is slowing the pace of runoff.",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","There isn't much runoff among MBS—in MBS right now, but there is in Treasuries.",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","And we’re talking about going to a lower pace.",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","I don’t want to give you a specific number because we haven’t made a—haven’t had an agreement or decision,",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","And that’s what we’re looking at.",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","In terms of the timing, I said fairly soon.",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","I wouldn’t want to try to be more specific than that,",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","The idea is—and this is in our longer-run plans—that we may actually be able to get to a lower level,",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","because we would avoid the kind of frictions that can happen.",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","Liquidity is not evenly distributed in a system.",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","reserves are ample or even abundant,",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","And those parts where they’re not ample,",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","and that can cause you to prematurely stop the process to avoid the stress.",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","And then it would be very hard to restart, we think.",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","So something like that happened in ’19 perhaps.",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","We’re looking at what would be a good time and what would be a good structure,",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","and “fairly soon” is words that we use to mean fairly soon.",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","So that—our, our longer-run goal is to return to a balance sheet that is mostly Treasuries.",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","I do expect that, once we’re through this, we’ll come back to the other issues about the composition and the maturity and revisit those issues, but it’s, you know, not",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","You know, we’ll be watching carefully.",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","But one of the reasons we’re slowing down—we will soon enough,",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","slow down—is that we want to avoid any,",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","I wasn’t thinking particularly about the banking- sector turbulence,",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","but we—and we had some indicators the last time.",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","This is our second time in doing this,",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","and I think we’re going to be paying a lot of attention to the things that started to happen and that foreshadowed what eventually happened at the end of that tightening cycle where we wound up in a short[-of-]reserves situation.",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","And we don’t want to do that again.",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","And I think now we have a better sense of what are the indicators.",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","It isn’t—it wasn’t so much in the banking system as it was around,",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","where federal funds are trading relative to the administered rates and where secured rates are relative to the administered rates.",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","We will always be watching the banking system for similar signs, though.",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","Well, I think we broadly think that, once [take-up at] the overnight [reverse] repo [facility] stabilizes, either at zero or close to zero, that, as the balance sheet",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","So it’s sort of ironic that, by going slower, you can get farther.",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","you won’t—you’ll run much less risk of kind of liquidity problems,",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","and which can cause you to stop the process prematurely.",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","So that’s—in terms of how it ends,",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","we’re going to be monitoring carefully money market conditions and asking ourselves whether they—what they’re telling us about reserves.",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","we would characterize them as “abundant,” and what we’re aiming for is “ample” and,",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","which is a little bit less than abundant.",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","there’s not a dollar amount or a percent of GDP or anything like that where we think we have a really pretty clear understanding of that.",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","We’re going to be looking at what these— what’s happening in money markets,",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","in particular—a bunch of different indicators,",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","including the ones I mentioned,",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","to tell us when we’re getting close.",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","you reach a point ultimately where you stop allowing the balance sheet to run off and you—but then,",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","there’s another period in which nonreserves—nonreserve liabilities grow organically,",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","and that also shrinks the reserves at a very slow pace.",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","Then you have another time where you effectively hold the above what we think the lowest possible ample number would be.",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","because we know that demand for reserves can be very volatile.",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","find ourselves in a situation where there aren’t reserves,",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","and we have to turn around and buy assets and put reserves back in the banking system the way we did in 2019 and ’20.",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","So we’re—most importantly, we’re looking at the incoming inflation data and the contents of it and what they’re telling us, so that’ll be—and also the various components—so obviously that’s what we want.",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","We want more confidence that inflation is coming down sustainably toward 2 percent.",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","And, I mean, of course we’ll also be looking at all the other things that are happening in the economy.",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","We’ll look at the totality of the data, including everything essentially as we make that assessment.",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","But the most important thing will be the inflation data coming in.",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","We don’t—our target is not wages.",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","But we would look to the fact that wages are still coming in very strong.",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","We don’t think that—the inflation was not originally caused—we think, I don’t think, by mostly by wages.",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","But we do think that,",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","to get inflation back down to 2 percent sustainably,",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","continuing gradual movement of wage increases at still high levels but back down to levels that are more sustainable over time.",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","I guess I’d put it this way: The—if you look at the incoming inflation data that we’ve had for January and February, I think very broadly that suggests that we were right to wait until we’re more confident.",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","So I think, I think—I didn’t hear anyone dismissing it as not information that we should look at or anything like that.",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","So I think, generally speaking, it does go in the direction of saying, yes, it’s appropriate for us to be careful as we approach this question.",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","So I think we’ve been pretty transparent on this, but I will— I’ll try harder.",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","So we are not getting ready to—we haven’t proposed—we haven’t come to a conclusion that we should propose,",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","that Congress consider legislation to authorize a digital dollar.",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","And it would take legislation by Congress signed by the President to give us the ability to do what we think of as a CBDC,",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","which is really a retail CBDC with the public.",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","So we’re just a long, long way from that.",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","and I think what every major central bank is doing,",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","is we’re trying to stay in the frontiers of what’s going on in digital finance,",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","It has applications in wholesale finance,",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","and so we need—to serve the public—these issues have become very front burner in the last five or six years—we need to be knowledgeable about all that.",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","So we actually do have people trying to understand things that are—but it’s wrong to say that we’re working on a CBDC and that we’ve secretly got a lab here where we’ve got one,",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","and we’re just going to spring it on Congress at the right moment.",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","made a decision that I think this is something the",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","this movement actually started 30 years ago—30 years ago,",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","when some academics posited that a more transparent central bank,",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","if the public understands your reaction function,",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","the markets will do your work for you.",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","And so it all happens that way and so there’s been a march toward greater and greater transparency.",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","And that—certainly Chairman Bernanke advanced that, Chairman Greenspan did, Chair Yellen did, and I.",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","so we went from four press conferences a year to eight,",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","so now every meeting really is “live” now.",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","I think that’s a good innovation.",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","I wouldn’t want to turn it back.",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","We also have done a bunch of other things.",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","You know, we have an annual supervision report, Financial Stability Report.",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","I mean, there’s a long list of things that we’ve done.",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","nothing comes to mind as really desperately in need of doing at this moment.",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","We have no shortage of FOMC participants speaking to the public through the media.",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","And so that channel is full, I would say.",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","So I think it’s generally broadly helped and made things better.",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","But not every day and in every way.",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","So let me say my main message at that—in those two days of hearings was really that the Committee needs to see more evidence to build our confidence that inflation is moving down sustainably toward our 2 percent goal,",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","and we don’t expect that it will be appropriate to begin to reduce rates until we’re more confident that that is the case.",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","I said that any number of times,",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","so those were kind of the main part of the message.",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","We repeated that today in our statement.",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","I also—to the language you mentioned,",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","I really pointed out that we had made significant progress over the past year,",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","and what we’re looking for now is confirmation that that progress will continue.",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","We had a series of inflation readings over the second half of last year that were really much lower.",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","We didn’t overreact, as I mentioned.",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","But that’s what I had in mind.",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","Well, we’ll just have to see how the data come in.",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","We would, of course, love to get great inflation data.",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","We got really good inflation data on the second—in the second part of last year.",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","Again, we didn’t overreact to it.",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","We said we needed to see more, and we said it would be bumpy.",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","And now we have January and February, which I’ve talked about a couple of times.",""
"2024-03-20","Q&A","So, you know, we’re looking for more good data, and we would certainly welcome it.",""
"2024-05-01","Opening Statement","My colleagues and I remain squarely focused on our dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people.",""
"2024-05-01","Opening Statement","The economy has made considerable progress toward our dual-mandate objectives.",""
"2024-05-01","Opening Statement","Inflation has eased substantially over the past year, while the labor market has remained strong.",""
"2024-05-01","Opening Statement","But inflation is still too high,",""
"2024-05-01","Opening Statement","further progress in bringing it down is not assured,",""
"2024-05-01","Opening Statement","and the path forward is uncertain.",""
"2024-05-01","Opening Statement","We are fully committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent goal.",""
"2024-05-01","Opening Statement","Restoring price stability is essential to achieve a sustainably strong labor market that benefits all.",""

"2024-05-01","Q&A","pretty clearly that policy is restrictive and is weighing on demand,",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","and there are a few places I would point to for that.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","You can start with the labor market.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","So demand is still strong—the demand side of the labor market,",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","in particular—but it’s cooled from its extremely high level of a couple years ago,",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","Indeed report and the JOLTS report.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","The same is true of quits and hiring rates, which have essentially normalized.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","I also look at the—we look at surveys of workers and—pardon me—surveys of workers and businesses,",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","“Are jobs plentiful?” and ask businesses,",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","Is it easy to find workers?” And you’ve seen that the answers to those have come back down to pre-pandemic levels.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","You also see in interest-sensitive spending,",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","like housing and investment—you also see that higher interest rates are weighing on those activities.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","So I do think it’s clear that, that policy is restrictive.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","So I would say that we believe it is restrictive, and we believe [that] over time it will be sufficiently restrictive.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","That will be a question that, that the data will have to answer.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","So I think it’s unlikely that the next policy rate move will be a hike.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","our policy focus is really what I just mentioned,",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","which is— which is how long to keep policy restrictive.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","I think we’d need to see persuasive evidence that our policy stance is not sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation sustainably down to 2 percent over time.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","That’s not—that’s not what we think we’re seeing,",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","but that’s—something like that is what it would take.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","We’d look at the totality of the data in answer to that question.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","That would include inflation, inflation expectations, and all the other data too.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","Well, I think, again, the test—what I’m saying is, if we were to come to that conclusion that policy weren’t tight enough to achieve that, so it would be the totality of all the things we’d be looking at.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","It could be a combination of things.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","But, if we—if we reach that conclusion—and we don’t see evidence supporting that conclusion—that’s what it would take I think for us to take that step.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","our decisions that we make on our policy rate are going to depend on the incoming data,",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","And we’ll look at the totality of the data.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","that policy is well positioned to address different paths that the economy might take.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","And we’ve said that we don’t think it would be appropriate to dial back our restrictive policy stance until we’ve gained greater confidence that inflation is moving down sustainably toward 2 percent.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","If we did have a path where inflation proves more persistent than expected and where the labor market remains strong,",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","but inflation is moving sideways and we’re not gaining greater confidence,",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","that would be a case in which it could be appropriate to hold off on rate cuts.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","I think there’s also other paths that the economy could take,",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","which would cause us to want to consider rate cuts.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","And those would be—two of those paths would be that we do gain greater confidence,",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","that inflation is moving sustainably down to 2 percent,",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","an unexpected weakening in the labor market,",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","So those are paths in which you could see us cutting rates.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","So I think it really will depend on the data.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","In terms of peak rate, you know, I think, really, it’s the same question.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","I, I think the data will have to answer that question for us.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","that be the key data in making that decision,",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","or could you expand a bit more on that?",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","it’s—we’ve set ourselves a test that we—for us to begin to reduce policy restriction,",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","we’d want to be confident that inflation is moving—you know,",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","moving sustainably down to 2 percent,",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","one of the things we’d be looking at is the performance of inflation.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","We’d also be looking at inflation expectations.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","We’d be looking at the whole story.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","But clearly, incoming, incoming inflation data would be at the very heart of that decision.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","So I think it’s hard to know that.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","I think we’ll be able to look back,",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","from down the road and look back and understand it better.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","You know, if you look at—let’s look at growth.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","what we’ve seen so far this year in the first quarter is growth coming in about consistent with where it was last year.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","I know GDP came in lower, but you don’t see an acceleration in growth.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","the thought would be that financial conditions loosened in,",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","and that caused an uptick in activity,",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","Presumably, that’s what we’re tightening in the labor market.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","You don’t really see that happening.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","What you see is economic activity at a level that’s roughly the same as,",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","In terms of tightening, you’re, you’re right.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","Rates are certainly higher now and have been for some time than they were before the December meeting.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","And they’re higher, and that’s tighter financial conditions.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","And, you know, that’s appropriate, given what inflation has done in the first quarter.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","So I just want to be careful that we don’t target wage growth or the labor market.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","And remember what we saw last year:",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","and a historically fast decline in inflation.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","So—and that’s because we know there are two forces at work here.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","There’s the unwinding of the pandemic-related supply-side distortions and demand-side distortions,",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","and there’s also monetary policy,",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","So I wouldn’t rule out that something like that can continue.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","on further things happening on the supply side either because,",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","we do see that companies still report that there are supply-side issues that they’re facing.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","even when the supply-side issues are solved,",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","it should take some time for that to affect economic activity and ultimately inflation.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","So there are still those things.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","So I don’t like to say that either strong—either growth or,",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","would automatically create problems on inflation,",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","wages, but we also want to see them not eaten up by high inflation.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","And that’s really what we’re trying to do,",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","is to cool the economy and work with what’s happening on the supply side to bring—to bring the economy back to 2 percent inflation.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","Part of that will probably be having wage increases move down incrementally toward levels that are more sustainable.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","I’m not really thinking of it that way.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","You know, the—what we said is that we need to be more confident, and we’ve said—my colleagues and I today said that we didn’t see progress in the first—in the first quarter.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","And I’ve said that it appears, then, that it’s going to take longer for us to reach that point of confidence.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","So I don’t know how long it’ll take.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","You know, I can just say that when we get that confidence, then rate cuts will be in scope.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","And I don’t know exactly when that will be.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","what—so I thought it was appropriate to reserve judgment until,",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","until we had the full quarter’s data,",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","What do we now see in the first quarter?",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","We see strong economic one or two months’ data, but this is a full quarter.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","And I think it’s appropriate to take signal now, and we are taking signal.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","And the signal that we’re taking is that it’s likely to take longer for us to gain confidence that we are on a sustainable path down to 2 percent inflation.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","That’s the signal that we’re taking now.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","we will put the thing—we have put the thing under a microscope.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","nothing is going to come out of that that’s going to change the view.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","we didn’t gain confidence and that it’s going to take longer to get that confidence—but—confidence.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","I just think—you know the story.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","What’s happened since December is you’ve seen higher goods inflation than expected,",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","and you’ve seen higher nonhousing services inflation than expected.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","And those two are working together to,",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","to sort of be higher than we had thought.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","And there are stories behind how that happened,",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","we—I think—I think my expectation is that we will,",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","I think my confidence in that is lower than it was because of the data that we’ve seen.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","So, you know, we’re looking at those things.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","those will show up in measured housing services inflation over time.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","We believe that it for in-housing services.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","I mean, the active tool of monetary policy is, of course, the interest rates.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","And this is—this is a long—a plan we’ve long had in place to slow,",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","provide accommodation to the economy but to—or to be less restrictive to the economy.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","It really is to ensure that the process of shrinking the balance sheet down to where we want to get it is a smooth one and doesn’t wind up in—with financial market turmoil the way it did the last—the last time we did this and the only other time we’ve ever done this.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","So, on your first question, I don’t have a probability estimate for you.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","we’ve said that we didn’t think it would be appropriate to cut until we were more confident that inflation was moving sustainably down to 2 percent.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","We didn’t get our confidence, in that [it] didn’t increase in the first quarter.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","what really happened was we came to the view that it will take longer to get that confidence.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","And I think there are—you know,",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","I think it’s—the economy has been very hard for forecasters broadly to predict—to predict its path.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","But there are paths to, to not cutting, and there are paths to cutting.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","It’s really going to depend on the data.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","In terms of the employment mandate,",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","if you go back a couple of years,",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","our sort of framework document says that,",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","when you look at the two mandate goals,",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","and if one of them is further away from goal than the other,",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","It actually—it’s the time to get back there times the,",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","times how far it is from the goal.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","And that was clearly inflation.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","So our focus was very much on inflation.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","As—and this is what we referred to in the statement.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","now to below 3 percent on a—on a 12-month basis,",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","it’s become—we’re now focusing [on] the other goal.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","The employment goal now comes back into focus.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","And, and that’s how we think about that.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","I’m not dealing really in likelihoods.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","I think there are—there are paths that the economy can take that would involve cuts and there are paths that wouldn’t.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","And I don’t have great confidence in which of those paths—I think I would say my personal forecast is that we will begin to see further progress on inflation this year.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","I don’t know that it will be enough, sufficient.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","I think we’re going to have to let the data lead us on that.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","In terms of your question—your second question was stagflation.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","I guess I would say I was around for stagflation,",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","It was high single-digits inflation.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","Right now we have—and very slow growth—so right now we have 3 percent growth,",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","pretty solid growth I would say,",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","and we have inflation running under 3 percent.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","So I don’t—I don’t really understand where that’s coming from.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","was that last year’s level of growth was very high—3.4 percent in,",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","you know— and probably not going to be sustained and would come down.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","But that would be—that would be our forecast.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","That would still be to a very healthy level of growth.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","our—we will return inflation to 2 percent,",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","and that won’t be—so I don’t see the “stag” or the “flation,” actually.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","So I think I would take that question this way:",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","We saw a year of very high productivity growth in 2023,",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","negative productivity growth in 2022.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","So I think it’s hard to draw from the data.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","I mean, the question is, will productivity run—there are two questions.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","One is: Will productivity run persistently above its longer-run trend?",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","In terms of potential output, though, that’s a separate question.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","We’ve had a—what amounts to a,",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","a significant increase in the potential output of the economy that’s not about productivity.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","It was about having more labor,",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","both through participation and also through immigration.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","So we’re very much—like other forecasters and economists—getting our arms around what that means for potential output this year and next year—and last year for that matter,",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","I think you really do have a significant increase in potential output,",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","but you’ve also got—so you’ve got more supply.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","But those people also come in, they work, they have jobs, they spend.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","So it—there may be—it may be that you get more supply than you get demand at the beginning,",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","it should be neither inflationary nor disinflationary over,",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","I think we, we believe our policy stance is in a good place and is appropriate to the current situation.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","We believe it’s restrictive, and, you know, we—our evidence more from monetary policy, whereas the supply side of things that are happening are more on the supply side.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","So that’s how I would think about it.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","Well, of course we’re not satisfied with 3 percent inflation.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","“Three percent” can’t be in a sentence with “satisfied.” [Laughter] So we will return inflation to 2 percent over time but over time.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","And we think our policy stance is, is appropriate to do that.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","So if we were to conclude that policy is not sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation sustainably down to 2 percent, then that would be what it would take for us to want to increase rates.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","We don’t see evidence for that.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","So the policy focus has been on—has really been on what to do about, about holding the current—the current level of restriction.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","That’s really—that’s part of the policy.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","That’s where the policy discussion was in the meeting.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","You know, these are— these are going to be judgment calls.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","You know, clearly restrictive monetary policy needs more time to do its job.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","That, that is pretty clear, based on what we’re seeing.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","How long that will take and how patient we should be is going to depend on the totality of the data, how the outlook evolves.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","we’re always going to do what we think the right thing for the economy is when we come to that consensus view that it’s the right thing to do for the economy.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","We’re not looking at anything else.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","You know, it’s hard enough to get the economics right here.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","if we were to take on a whole,",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","set of factors and use that as a new filter,",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","it would reduce the likelihood we’d actually get the economics right.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","So that’s how we think about it around here.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","And, you know, we’re at peace over it.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","We know that we’ll do what we think is the right thing,",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","when we think it’s the right thing.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","And that’s, that’s how everybody around here thinks.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","that we just don’t—we just don’t go down that road.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","If you go down that road, where do you stop?",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","And, and so we’re not on that road.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","—a significant difference between an institution that takes into account all sorts of political events and one that doesn’t.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","That’s where the significant difference is, and, you know, we’re—we just don’t do that.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","I mean, you can go back and read the transcripts for every—this is my fourth election, fourth presidential election here.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","Read all the transcripts, and see if anybody mentions, in any way, the pending election.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","It just isn’t part of our thinking.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","It’s not what we’re hired to do.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","If we start down that road, again, I don’t know how you stop.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","So I think if you go back to where wages peaked—wage increases peaked a couple,",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","three years ago—essentially all wage measures have come down substantially [when compared] to that.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","But they are not, not down to where they were before the pandemic.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","So yeah, I mean, it’s—that part of it is bumpy.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","we don’t target wage increases,",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","if you have—if you have wage increases running higher than productivity would warrant,",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","there will be inflationary pressures.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","Employers will raise prices over time if that’s the case.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","It has been inconsistent, but we have seen a substantial decline overall.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","But we have a ways to go on that.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","Well, the thing that hurts everybody, and particularly people in the lower-income brackets, is inflation.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","If you’re a person who’s living paycheck to paycheck,",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","and suddenly all the things you buy—the fundamentals of life—go up in price,",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","you are in trouble right away.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","we’re using our tools to bring down inflation.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","It will take some time, but we will succeed.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","And we will bring inflation back down to 2 percent,",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","and then people won’t have to worry about it again.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","That’s what we’re doing, and we know that it’s painful and inconvenient.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","But the dividends will be paid and will be very large.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","and everyone will share in those dividends,",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","and we’ve made quite a lot of progress if you can think about it.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","I think core—I think headline—core",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","I think—I think that restrictive monetary policy is doing what it’s supposed to do,",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","working alongside and with the healing of the supply side.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","this—what was different this time was that a big part of the source of the inflation and the reason why we’re having this conversation is that we had this supply-side kind of collapse,",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","with shortages and bottlenecks and all that kind of thing.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","And so—and this was to do with the shutting down and reopening of the economy and other things that,",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","So I think now you see those two things working together,",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","the reversal of those supply and demand distortions from the pandemic and the response to it,",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","along with restrictive monetary policy.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","Those two things are working to bring down inflation,",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","and we’ve made a lot of progress.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","Let’s remember how far we’ve come.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","but we’re not looking at the very high inflation rates that we were seeing two years ago.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","you know that we all serve domestic mandates,",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","So I think the difference between the United States and other countries that are now considering rate cuts is that they’re just not having the kind of growth we’re having.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","They have—their inflation is performing about like ours or maybe a little better,",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","but they’re not experiencing the kind of growth we’re experiencing.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","So we actually have the luxury of having strong growth and a strong labor market,",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","And we will—we’ll be careful and cautious as we approach the decision to cut rates,",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","whereas I think other jurisdictions may go before that.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","In terms of the implications, you know, I think obviously markets see it coming.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","And so I think the markets and economies can adapt to it.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","for the emerging market economies,",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","we haven’t seen the kind of turmoil that was more frequent 20 years ago,",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","partly because emerging market countries,",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","many of them have much better monetary policy frameworks,",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","much more credibility on inflation.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","And so they’re navigating this pretty well this time.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","You know, I said “an unexpected weakening” is what I—the way I characterized it.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","So, you know—and I’m not going to try to define exactly what I mean by that.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","But, you know, it would be—it would have to be meaningful and get our attention and lead us to broader—it would be a broader thing that would—that would suggest that it would be appropriate to consider cutting.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","I think whether you decide to cut will depend on all the facts and circumstances, not just that one.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","So let me—let me start by saying that the Fed is committed to,",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","completing this process and carrying out Basel III Endgame in a way that’s faithful to Basel and also comparable to what the other large comparable jurisdictions are doing.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","We haven’t made any decisions on, on policy or on process at all.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","I’ll say again, though, if we conclude that re-proposal is appropriate, we won’t hesitate to insist on that.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","listen to my 18 colleagues on the FOMC,",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","you’ll see that we do not lack for a diversity of voices and perspectives.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","And it’s one of the great aspects of the Federal Reserve System.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","We have 12 Reserve Banks around the country where they have their own economic staff,",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","not the people who work here at the Board.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","each Reserve Bank has its own culture around monetary policy and its own approach and that kind of thing.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","It guarantees you a diversity of perspectives.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","So I think that the perspectives are very diverse.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","But—and, in terms of—in terms of dissents, you know, we have dissents.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","a thoughtful dissent is a good thing,",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","if someone really makes you think,",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","But all I can say from my standpoint is I try—I listen carefully to people.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","I try to incorporate their thinking or do everything I can to incorporate their thinking into what we’re doing.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","if they feel that’s happening,",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","that for most people most of the And I mean,",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","I think we have a very diverse group of rounded people—frankly,",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","more diverse than it used to be in many dimensions,",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","more diverse from the obvious gender and demographic ways,",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","but also we have more people who are not Ph.D.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","So we have people from business and law and academia and things like that.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","So I think we actually do have quite a good diverse perspective.",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","I think all of us read these stories about the lack of diversity,",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","and we look around the room and say,",""
"2024-05-01","Q&A","I really don’t understand what they’re talking about.” So—but I get the question, though.",""
"2024-06-12","Opening Statement","My colleagues and I remain squarely focused on achieving our dual-mandate goals of maximum employment and stable prices for the benefit of the American people.",""

"2024-06-12","Q&A","So what’s going on there is that we had very low readings in the second half of last year—June through December,",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","So as you go through the 12-month window,",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","The new reading gets added to the 12-month window.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","a slight element of conservativism that we’re,",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","we’re assuming a certain level of—of,",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","incoming monthly PCE and core PCE numbers.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","We’re assuming, you know, good, but not great, numbers.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","And if you put that on top of where we are now,",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","you get a very slight increase in the 12-month—in the 12-month,",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","Now, do we have high confidence that that’s right?",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","It’s just the kind of conservative way for forecasting things.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","If we were to get more readings like today’s reading,",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","So it’s just a forecasting device.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","I think—let me say that we welcome today’s reading and then hope for more like that.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","we’ve—what we said is that we don’t think it’ll be appropriate to,",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","to reduce rates and begin to loosen policy until we have more confidence that inflation is moving back down to 2 percent on a—on a sustainable basis.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","And that’s the—that’s the test we’ve applied.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","I don’t know that—I think if we—I don’t know that this rules that in or out.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","I mean, really, it’s, it’s a forecast—a fairly conservative forecast month by month that would lead to slightly higher, you know, 12-months rates by the end of the year.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","So as far as the SEP part of that is concerned—as you know,",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","I talk to—I talk to all of the other participants on the FOMC every cycle,",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","and we talk about their Summary of Economic Projections and,",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","their dot plot and everything.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","And what you—what I hear and see is that people are looking at,",""

"2024-06-12","Q&A","They’re so close for me.” These are very close calls,",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","but we ask them to write down the most likely one—so they do.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","are kind of clustered around one or two.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","at all—I’d look at all of them as plausible,",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","but I’d look at—so I think that does tell you kind of what the Committee thinks.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","But what everyone agrees on is, it’s going to be data dependent.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","No one—no one brings to this or takes away from it that is on the Committee a really strong commitment to a particular rate path.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","It’s actually just their forecast and their—it’s a combination of their forecast and their own reaction function.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","everyone would say that this is very data dependent,",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","and I thing.” It’s just what they think at a given moment in time,",""

"2024-06-12","Q&A","Certainly, more good inflation readings will help with that.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","I’m not going to be specific about how many because,",""

"2024-06-12","Q&A","Have we reached an appropriate level of confidence that inflation is moving down sustainably to 2 percent,",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","do we see really unexpected signs of weakness in the labor market that would call for a response?”—which is—which is another thing that could,",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","But, again, we don’t see that.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","And I—we do see today’s—we see today’s report as,",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","we don’t see ourselves as having the confidence that would warrant—you know,",""

"2024-06-12","Q&A","to loosen policy at this time.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","So we—this happens too often, but it, it does happen.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","you know—data came—I think it happened a couple of meetings ago—a few meetings ago.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","So when that happens—when there’s an important data print during the meeting,",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","first day or second day— But I’m not going to get into the specifics,",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","but you have the ability to do that.",""

"2024-06-12","Q&A","I think we’ll, you know—you will see PPI tomorrow.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","We’ll know more about the PCE [inflation] reading as the month goes on.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","But the initial CPI reading and its,",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","kind of first-level translation to,",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","to PCE [inflation] we did have this morning.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","and people were able to consider whether they should make changes.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","And, as I said, you know, some people generally do, but most people generally don’t.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","was kind of overheated two years ago.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","And we’ve seen it gradually move back into much better balance between supply and demand.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","We’ve seen labor force supply come up quite a bit through immigration and through recovering participation.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","That’s ongoing, mostly now through the immigration channel.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","But still, we’ve had some increases in prime-age labor force.",""

"2024-06-12","Q&A","We’ve seen wage increases moving from very,",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","So you put all that together—what you have is still-low unemployment,",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","still 4 percent unemployment—historically low.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","But it’s moved up a little bit—it’s softened a bit—and,",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","But, but more than that, you’ve got strong job creation.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","you have payroll jobs still coming in strong,",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","there’s an argument that they may be a bit overstated but still they’re,",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","and the economy as a whole—but the labor market very carefully—and that’s what we see.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","We see gradual cooling—gradual moving toward better balance.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","We’re monitoring it carefully for signs of,",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","So sometimes it’s—you can’t reconcile the differences.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","You just have to, have to—have to look at it and, and try to understand.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","And that’s why it always makes sense to look at a series,",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","and 12 months of things rather than just one report.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","But you’re right to point to the last report,",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","where it was your—job losses in the household survey—job gains,",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","big job gains in the establishment survey.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","we’re left with ambiguous results,",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","and we have to deal with that uncertainty around data.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","Nonetheless, the overall picture is one of a strong and gradually cooling—gradually rebalancing labor market.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","greater than the number of but not the superheated labor market of two years ago or even one year ago.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","The big thing that changed was the inflation forecast.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","So the inflation forecast moved up several tenths for the end of the year.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","what did we take away from this?",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","really good inflation data in the second half of last year,",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","then kind of a pause in progress in the first quarter.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","And what we took away from that was that it’s probably going to take longer to get the confidence that we need to begin to loosen policy.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","So the sense of that is that rate cuts that might take place in—might’ve taken place this year—take place next year,",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","we—there are—there are fewer rate cuts in the median this year,",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","but there’s one more next year.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","so you really—if you look at year-end 2025 and ’26,",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","you’re almost exactly where you would have been,",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","just it—just it’s moved later because of that progress.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","Now, you get another—you get data—different data today.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","So we’ll have to see where the data light the way.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","repeatedly surprised forecasters in both directions,",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","and today was certainly a better inflation report than almost anybody expected.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","So two things about that—one, one is this—you’re right, it did move up.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","but I want to remember to point out that the long-run neutral rate of interest is,",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","It, it really is a theoretical concept—can’t be directly observed.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","the interest rate that would hold the economy at equilibrium—maximum employment and price stability—potentially,",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","potentially years in the future where there are no shocks.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","So it’s— it’s a little bit—it’s not something we observe today.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","Today we’ve got a very specific economy with all kinds of shocks we’re still getting over from the pandemic.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","the concept of r-star—it’s a very important concept in economics and in what we do.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","it doesn’t really get you where you need to be to think about what appropriate policy is in the near term.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","I—back to your original question,",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","people have been gradually writing it up because I just think people are coming to the view that rates aren’t—are less likely to go down to their,",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","very low by recent history measures.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","Now, we, we can’t really know that.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","that’s an interesting dispute and discussion to have now,",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","we think that things like the neutral rate are driven by longer-run,",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","That’s been the debate, and we can’t know.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","we’re making policy with the economy that we have—with the distortions that we have.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","I think it is—it is the case that as time has gone by,",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","the question of “How restrictive is policy?” has become one that everyone’s asking,",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","And, you know, my answer has been that policy is restrictive.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","The question of whether it’s sufficiently restrictive is going to be one we,",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","But I think for the reasons I’ve talked about at the last press conference and,",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","I think the evidence is pretty clear that policy is restrictive and is having,",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","the effects that we would hope for.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","I’d be reluctant to try to draw that conclusion.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","looking at the incoming data and asking,",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","“How much progress are we making on inflation,",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","and how is the rest of the economy doing?",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","Is the labor market still strong?” That’s what we’re thinking about.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","you can—you can translate it into the—into the language you’re talking about,",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","We think we’ve got a good, strong labor market still.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","We think we’ve been making progress toward the price- meantime,",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","“Is our policy stance about right?” And I think we think,",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","it’s about right.” We’re prepared to adjust that as appropriate,",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","but we think—we think we’re getting the things that we would want to get,",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","And that’s why we’ve been at this policy rate now for almost a year.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","Well, you know, it’s been coming—where’s it been coming from— let’s start with that.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","clearly a lot of what—some of what we’ve been getting is just the reversal of the—the unwinding of the pandemic-related distortions to both supply and demand.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","And that is, you know—that is complemented by and amplified—supported by restrictive monetary policy.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","So those two things have been working together.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","We’ve also had a very positive supply shock on the labor side.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","you get—you get a positive supply shock when the—when the supply conditions unwind and return to normal.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","So you’ve had, you know, above-trend potential growth and, and high growth.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","And yet you’ve had the benefit of,",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","and you will see what the rest of this year brinks—brings.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","So these dynamics can continue as long as they continue.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","I mean, ultimately, the question is, ultimately, are you down to demand?",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","And, and we don’t know that, progress on inflation with our current stance.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","Well, we think—we think policy is restrictive.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","that if you—if you just set policy at a restrictive level,",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","eventually you will see real weakening in the economy.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","So that’s always been the thought is that,",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","since we raise rates this far,",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","we’ve always been pointing to cuts at a certain point.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","Not to eliminate the possibility of hikes,",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","no one has that as their base case,",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","so—no one on the Committee does.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","But so that’s, that’s—you know, that’s how we think about it.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","And that’s what we’ve been getting.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","That’s what we’ve been getting is good progress on inflation,",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","a good level and with a strong labor market.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","Now, ultimately, we think rates will have to come down to continue to support that.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","But, so far, they haven’t had to.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","And, you know, that’s why we’re watching so carefully for signs of weakness.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","We kind of see what we wanted to see,",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","which was gradual cooling in demand—gradual rebalancing in the",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","On housing—you know, the housing situation is a complicated one.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","And you can see that’s a place where rates are really having,",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","the best thing we can do for the housing market is to bring inflation down so that we can bring rates down so that the housing market can continue to normalize.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","There will still be a national housing shortage, as there was before the pandemic.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","but the distortions that we see now with lock-ins and things like that—you know,",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","low mortgages—in terms of banks,",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","Lending—you know, we’ve seen good performance by the banks.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","We had the turmoil earlier last year,",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","banks have been focusing on bringing up their liquidity,",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","and having a risk—risk-management plans in place.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","So the banking system, you know, seems to be—seems to be in good shape.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","So I, I think it’s true that housing—that inflationary pressures have come down.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","But we still have—we’re still getting high inflation readings.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","you know—and I think you can see it in,",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","in various places in—you know,",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","You see elevated inflation still—and that’s probably to do with—it could be to do with wages.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","Goods prices have kind of fluctuated.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","There’s been a surprising increase in,",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","which is kind of hard to understand.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","may—we’ve taken some signal from that,",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","You’re seeing—you’re continuing to see high readings there to some extent.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","That’s, that’s, you know, catch-up inflation from earlier pressures.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","But, I mean, overall, you’re right.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","Inflationary pressures have come down.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","As I mentioned, the labor market has come into better balance.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","which would be that of trend inflation and trend productivity.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","You’re still seeing wage increases moving above that.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","We, we haven’t thought of wages as being the principal, you know, cause of inflation.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","getting back to 2 percent inflation is likely to require a return to a more sustainable level,",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","which is somewhat below the current level of increases in the aggregate.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","we always want to avoid the tendency to dismiss the parts of inflation that we—that we don’t like and just make it go away.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","So—but we had a quarter where inflation was running higher,",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","“It’s stuff we shouldn’t have taken signal from.” But it is what it is.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","You know, you, you have to—you know, low inflation is low inflation.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","High—so if you have a quarter where it’s higher—we tried not to take signal from the first couple of months,",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","the signal we’re taking is that,",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","we think it’s going to take longer to get confidence that reading,",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","which is very different—very much more positive.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","We’re going to have to see what the trend is—what’s,",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","what’s going to be the data going forward.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","We’re looking for something that gives us confidence that inflation is,",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","is moving sustainably down to 2 percent.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","And readings like today’s, you know—that’s a step in the right direction.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","But, you know, one reading is—isn’t—it just—it’s only one reading.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","You don’t want to—you don’t want to be too motivated by any single data point.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","I don’t think anyone knows—has a definitive answer why people are,",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","are not as happy about the economy as they might be.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","And we don’t tell people how they should think or feel about the economy.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","We—you know, people experience what they experience.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","All I can tell you is what the—what the data show,",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","we’ve got an economy that’s growing at a solid pace.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","We’ve got a very strong labor market with unemployment at 4 percent.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","It’s been a long time since we’ve had,",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","a long stretch of time with unemployment at or below 4 percent—very long time.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","We had a period of high inflation.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","We—inflation has come down really significantly,",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","and we’re doing everything we can to—you know,",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","to bring that inflationary episode fully to a halt and fully restore price stability.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","We’re confident that we’ll get there.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","but the ultimate pain would be a,",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","high—a long period of high So,",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","it’s for those people—for all Americans,",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","but particularly for those people—that we’re doing everything we can to bring inflation back down under control.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","Well, you know, I, I don’t have a precise date for you.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","we want to make sure that we’re confident that inflation is actually moving back down to 2 percent.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","And when we are, then we can look at loosening policy.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","So having that kind of confidence that inflation will be at 2 percent just—it just pays benefits to the whole economy,",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","We had that period for a very long time.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","We very much want to get back to a place where people can,",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","can not think about inflation—it’s just not a concern in the everyday economic decisions that they make.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","We were there for a long time,",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","and our goal is to get back to that place.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","and we’re just—we’re in the phase now of just,",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","sticking with it until we get it done.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","So, encouraging has been that growth—you know, the growth, clearly, that we had last year, particularly the second half of last year, and we continue to see still-strong growth—solid growth this year.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","If you go back a year, there was a real concern about, you know, very much slowing growth and, and a recession—many forecasters had that.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","So, you know, we monitor all the things you mentioned and more.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","spending was going up faster than disposable income during big parts of next year,",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","rather—and so what that—you’d expect to see is people spending more on their credit cards.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","Credit card balances have been going up.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","Credit card defaults have been going up.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","Remember that after the pandemic, people were cooped up.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","They couldn’t go out to spend money; they could spend money from home.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","we see the same data that everybody else sees,",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","but you’ve still got a household sector that’s in—that’s in pretty good shape.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","it’s not in the kind of shape it was in a year or two ago.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","And we’re, you know—we’re carefully watching that.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","So consumer spending is still growing.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","It’s not growing at the pace it was growing at a year or so ago, but, but it’s still—it’s still growing solidly.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","And, by the way, other parts of the economy are picking up.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","Spending on equipment and intangibles is—has picked up quite a bit, you know, in the wake of all the construction that we saw of new tech— you know, tech plants.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","So, overall, the economy is exhibiting solid growth, and, you know— something around 2 percent—which is—which is, you know, good—a good pace of growth for the",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","when I say “unexpectedly,” the first thing is more than,",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","is in our forecast or in common forecasts—so,",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","But we’ll be looking at everything.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","has the tendency sometimes to,",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","So waiting for that to happen is, is not what we’re doing.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","You know, we’re watching very carefully; we’re looking at the balance of risks.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","I always point out the balance of risks,",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","and also the fact that we look at,",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","at all of it—the whole situation.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","a decision to begin to—you know,",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","to loosen policy could have several reasons associated with it at a given time.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","we monitor all the—all the labor market data.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","And if we saw troubling—weakening more than—more than expected,",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","then that would be something we’d consider responding to.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","But we’d look at the—we look at the broader context of what’s going on, too.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","I’m not going to—yeah, I mean, I, I can think of things that would— many things would make it on that list, but I don’t think I’ll, I’ll utter them here.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","I don’t actually have that kind of mechanical thing in,",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","you know—as many good ones as we had bad ones—but it’s not like that.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","It’s going to be the totality of the data—[including] labor market data, the growth data.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","you’d want to see real progress that builds your confidence that we’re—that we are on a path down to 2 percent.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","I don’t want to try to give you specific numbers of things,",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","I just don’t think—we’re not at a point of being able to do that.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","So we don’t—actually, it’s our—it’s our finance ministry, the Treasury Department, that has a responsibility for thinking about and, and, if it sees fit, doing things about the level of the dollar.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","So for us, it’s just another financial variable.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","And you’re right—the dollar has been—has exhibited, exhibited some strength over the course of the last year or so because the",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","You know—so we are—we’re well aware of the two-sided risks here, let me just say.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","we understand that if we wait too long,",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","that could come at the cost of economic activity,",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","We understand that if we move too,",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","we could end up undoing a lot of the good that we’ve done and have to then start over,",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","and it could be very disruptive.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","we’re extremely aware of both of those risks and,",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","and just basically trying to manage them.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","And what we said is that we’ll—that we’re—we don’t think it’ll be appropriate to,",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","to begin to loosen policy until we’re more confident that inflation is moving down to 2 percent over time on a sustainable basis.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","That’s—that’s kind of been our test.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","Or there’s another test, which is, you know, an unexpected deterioration in labor market conditions.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","So I think that’s, that’s the right way for us to think about it.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","That’s our—that’s our dual mandate there.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","And, you know, we, we have a strong economy.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","We’ve got growth—all forecasts are very commonly around 2 percent.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","That’s a—that’s a strong growth rate for our we’re doing.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","Yeah, we, we completely understand that that’s the risk.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","And that’s, that’s not what we’re—that’s not our plan is to wait for things to break and then try to fix them.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","We’re, we’re trying to balance these two goals in a way that is consistent with our framework, and we think we’re doing that.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","So we—what, what we’ve been thinking is that we would announce and commence the review later or late in the year.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","In the meantime, as that time approaches, we will be devoting a lot of careful thought and planning to the contours of it.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","Within scope would certainly be communications generally.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","I—I’m not going to say that we’ll look at this or that particular thing.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","And all the other details, you know—we’re just—we don’t want to get",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","I wouldn’t—there isn’t any one thing—one variable,",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","that would really decide or decide against what we’re doing.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","which is greater confidence that inflation is moving down to 2 percent on a sustainable basis.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","Or, alternatively, we see unexpected weakening in the labor market.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","So those are—those are two different tests.",""
"2024-06-12","Q&A","we’re not— we’re not looking at any one price in any one sector and saying,",""

"2024-07-31","Q&A","We think what the data broadly show in the labor market is an ongoing, gradual normalization of labor market conditions.",""

"2024-07-31","Q&A","That’s, that’s part of what we’re thinking.",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","So we have, we have—growth isn’t one of our three.",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","We have two mandates, as you know.",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","The labor market, maximum employment is one, and stable prices is another.",""

"2024-07-31","Q&A","When we were far away from our inflation mandate, we had to focus on that.",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","back to a closer to even focus,",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","so we’ll be looking at labor market conditions and asking whether we’re getting what we’re seeing.",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","we’re prepared to respond if we see that it’s—that it’s not what we wanted to see,",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","a gradual normalization of conditions—if we see more than that.",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","And it wouldn’t be any one statistic,",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","the unemployment rate is generally thought to be,",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","a single—a good single statistic.",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","we’d be looking at participation,",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","we’d be looking at all the things—surveys,",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","all of those things—to determine the overall status of the labor market.",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","I think you’re back to conditions that are close to 2019 conditions,",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","and that was not an inflationary economy—broadly similar labor markets then.",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","I think inflation was actually—core inflation was actually running below 2 percent.",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","So we don’t think—I don’t that’s part of what’s behind our thinking.",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","The other part, of course, is that we have made real progress on inflation.",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","And we’re—we’ve got growing confidence there that we are not quite there yet,",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","but we’re more confident that we’re on a—that we’re on a sustainable path down to 2 percent.",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","So those two things are working together, and we’re factoring those both into our policy.",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","So I wouldn’t say I wouldn’t want to see any other cooling.",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","It would be more of a material difference.",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","If we—if we’d be looking at this and if we see something that looks like a more significant downturn,",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","that would be something that we would—we would have the intention of responding to.",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","So, in terms of—I don’t think of it that way.",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","I think of it as, you know, we’re actually in a good place here.",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","We’re balancing these two risks of,",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","and you undermine progress on inflation;",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","wait too long or don’t go fast enough,",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","and you put at risk the recovery.",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","And so we have to balance those two things.",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","That’s the nature of having two mandates,",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","and I think we—this is how we balance them.",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","the labor market feels like it’s in a place where it’s just a process of ongoing normalization;",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","4.1 percent unemployment is still historically low.",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","And, you know, we’ll just have to see what the data show us.",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","So it painted a picture of a very static labor market.",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","Is that sustainable in your view or something that is worrying?",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","So I think all of the data points continue to point to kind of the direction we would want to see.",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","So that was taken as, you know, there was a decline in job openings.",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","Today’s ECI reading was a little softer than expected, so that’s, that’s a good reading.",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","It shows that wage increases are still at a strong level but that that level continues to come down to more sustainable levels over time.",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","That’s exactly the pattern that we want to be seeing.",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","So I think the data—the data we’ve been seeing in the labor market are broadly consistent with that normalization process.",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","we’re closely monitoring to see whether it starts to show signs that it’s more than that.",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","Yeah, I can’t really say that, honestly.",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","we’re—we— we’ve seen significant movement in the labor market,",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","we’re very mindful of this question of,",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","is it just normalization or is it more?",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","We think it’s just normalization,",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","but we want to be in a position to,",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","At the same time, we’re seeing progress on over 4 percent.",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","It was a completely different economy.",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","Now we’ve made a lot of progress,",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","and the labor market—I think unemployment was in the 3s,",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","to adjust that so that we support this continued process.",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","The thing we’re trying to do is—you know that we have,",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","we’ve had this really significant decline in inflation,",""

"2024-07-31","Q&A","And this is—this is part of that.",""

"2024-07-31","Q&A","we can afford to begin to dial back the restriction in our policy rate.",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","And I think we’re just—it’s part of a process.",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","In terms of what that looks like,",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","I think most rate—you would think,",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","that policy rates would move down from here,",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","but I don’t want to try to give specific forward guidance about when that might be,",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","the pace at which it might happen,",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","because I think that’s really going to depend on the economy,",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","So the thing about—if what it is is seasonality,",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","and it could just be— it’s very,",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","to do appropriate seasonal adjustments.",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","then that actually implies that,",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","that other months were underreporting too low inflation.",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","If you smoothed it out, it’s a zero-sum game.",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","And that’s why we look at 12 months.",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","We look at 12 months because that takes all of that out,",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","Twelve-month now is 2½ percent headline, 2.6 percent core.",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","This is so much better than where we were even a year ago.",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","and we’re committed to equally than we did a year ago.",""

"2024-07-31","Q&A","and if one of them is farther away than the other—the two variables,",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","inflation and employment—if one is farther away from its goal than the other,",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","you concentrate on the one that’s farther away.",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","And you take account of the time to reach the goal.",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","the best service we could do to the American people was to focus on inflation.",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","But as inflation has come down—and I think the upside risks to inflation have decreased as the labor market has cooled off,",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","and now the labor market has softened—you know,",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","inflation’s probably a little farther from its target than is employment,",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","but I think the downside risks to,",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","to the employment mandate are,",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","and if you think about where that takes us is we have a restrictive policy rate.",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","It’s been the rate we’ve had in place for a full year.",""

"2024-07-31","Q&A","“Certainty” is not a word that we have in our—in our business.",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","we get—we get a lot of data between now and September,",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","and it isn’t going to be one data read or even two.",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","It’s going to be the totality of the data,",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","and not just—and then how is that affecting the outlook?",""

"2024-07-31","Q&A","we’ll all look carefully at the employment report,",""

"2024-07-31","Q&A","Well, you know, we’ll look at everything.",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","We’ve seen some, some tendency to have a narrowing base of job creation in some months going back, but then we’ve private demand extra carefully, to your point about, about government.",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","So we’ll just be looking at, at all those things.",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","Yeah, so look, the objective is to balance the two risks, right?",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","It’s the risk of going too soon and the risk of going too late.",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","we had seven months of good inflation data at the end of last year.",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","We said we wanted to see more.",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","We said—we pointed out that too much of this was coming from goods,",""

"2024-07-31","Q&A","we’re balancing the risk of going too soon against the risk of going too late.",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","It’s a very difficult judgment call, but this is—this is how we’re making it.",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","we had a nice conversation about,",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","The overall sense of the Committee,",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","is that we’re getting closer to the point at which it will be appropriate to begin to dial back restriction,",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","but we’re not quite at that point yet.",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","We want to see more good data.",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","The decision was unanimous—all 19 participants supported it.",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","But there was a real discussion back and forth of what the case would be for,",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","And I think the lags have kind of showed up here in the last six months,",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","you really do now see the restriction,",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","people were questioning how restrictive policy was.",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","Look at the labor market now—you can see.",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","And look at inflation—sorry—rate-sensitive, interest-sensitive spending.",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","You really do see now that policy is restrictive.",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","I wouldn’t say it’s extremely restrictive, but it’s certainly effectively restrictive.",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","Yes, there—the lag should, should be on the way down.",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","It should take some time to get into—to get into the full economy,",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","And that affects economic activity, hiring and that kind of thing, and, ultimately, inflation.",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","although it’s faster than it used to be because markets move now in anticipation of our moves.",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","and we don’t want to go too soon,",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","and we don’t want to go too late.",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","But that’s—this is how we made that judgment.",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","I feel good about where we what we’re seeing, though.",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","What we’re seeing—look at the—look at the first-half growth numbers.",""

"2024-07-31","Q&A","the unemployment rate has moved up seven-tenths,",""

"2024-07-31","Q&A","and they’re historically not high at all.",""

"2024-07-31","Q&A","are we worried about a sharper downturn in the labor market?",""

"2024-07-31","Q&A","many received—pieces of received wisdom just haven’t worked,",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","and it’s because this situation really is unusual or unique in that so much of this inflation came from the shutdown of the economy and the resulting supply problems in the face of,",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","So the whole—the whole situation is not the same as many of the other prior inflation or downturns that we’ve seen or business cycles that we’ve seen.",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","to be very careful about the judgments that we make,",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","So we don’t assume that these regularities will, will just repeat themselves automatically.",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","So I do take that seriously, and the Beige Book is great.",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","What’s even greater is hearing the Reserve Bank presidents come in and talk about their conversations with,",""

"2024-07-31","Q&A","does—I think it’s important to listen to anecdotal data and not just look at the aggregate data.",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","Especially, you know, it’s very hard—GDP data can be volatile quarter to quarter.",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","So it’s just hard to measure economic activity.",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","There are a lot of—it’s just difficult to do.",""

"2024-07-31","Q&A","We’re not—we can run simulations of different potential policies,",""

"2024-07-31","Q&A","We do have a very robust discussion of these things.",""

"2024-07-31","Q&A","Of course, we haven’t made any decisions at all as of today.",""

"2024-07-31","Q&A","And then, this morning, we have the monetary policy go-round.",""

"2024-07-31","Q&A","people express their views about this,",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","People—as you will know from the speeches that they give—people have different ways of thinking about the economy.",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","we’ll lay this out in a much—in a much better way than I can do off the cuff,",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","but there’s a range of perspectives.",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","And, supported the outcome—not just the voters, but everyone.",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","some people examined the possibility,",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","the case for moving at this meeting,",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","the sense of the Committee was not at this meeting but as soon as the next meeting,",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","depending on how the data come in.",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","Well, assuming that the totality of the data supports such an outcome.",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","That’s, that is the case, as I mentioned.",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","We think that the time is, is— it’s approaching, and if we do get the data that we—that we hope we get, then a reduction in our policy rate could be on the table at the September meeting.",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","So this is the judgment that we have to make,",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","we’re well aware of the judgment.",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","we have to weigh the risk of going too soon against the risk of going too late.",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","we can—we had a lot of advice,",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","to go ahead and cut after the seven good months of last year.",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","We said we needed to see anymore for us to get the inflation results that are related to the labor market—not all inflation is,",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","So I think it’s a difficult judgment to make,",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","and what you see is the judgment of the Committee is that that time is drawing near.",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","That time could be in September if, if the data support that.",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","So I, I don’t know whether they’ve increased.",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","I think this is—you don’t see any reason to think that this economy is either overheating or sharply weakening.",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","That’s just not in the data right now.",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","What’s in the data right now is an economy that’s growing at a—at a solid pace,",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","a labor market that has cooled off,",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","The data overall show a strong labor market.",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","And so that’s, that’s really what you see.",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","It’s not—it’s neither an overheating economy, nor is it a sharply weakening economy.",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","it’s kind of what you would want to see,",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","You know, we’re, we’re watching to see, you know, which way the economy heads.",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","And I think we’re—if we are to respond to weakness,",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","But that’s not what we’re seeing.",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","What we’re seeing is strong economic activity and,",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","a good labor market and inflation coming down.",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","that forecasters—and this isn’t just the Fed by any means—forecasters have been continually surprised by,",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","the strength of the economy last year.",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","So I think we had to be pretty humble about,",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","about giving forward guidance about this,",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","We need to be pretty careful about that.",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","when you’re saying you’re going to be data driven,",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","it’s always what the data—how they affect the outlook and the balance of risks,",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","but it’s—nobody has great vision deep into the future.",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","In terms of a reaction function,",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","that’s a—that’s a long-time discussion that people have had forever.",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","I think people have understood for a long time,",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","that we were very focused on bringing down inflation.",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","Nobody was really confused about that.",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","we’ve seen significant improvement in inflation just for the last quarter.",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","Markets move around on that—on the data, really.",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","Not so much—it’s not really what we’re going to do.",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","It’s more just that the data keep coming in,",""
"2024-07-31","Q&A","very responsive to that data right now.",""

"2024-09-18","Q&A","We’ve had the two employment reports, July and August.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","We’ve also had two inflation reports, including one that came in during blackout.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","which suggests that maybe—that not maybe,",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","but suggests that the payroll report numbers that we’re getting may be artificially high and will be revised down.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","We’ve also seen anecdotal data, like [the data collected in] the Beige Book.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","So we took all of those, and we went into blackout.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","And we thought about what to do,",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","and we concluded that this was the right thing for the economy,",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","that’s how we made our decision.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","What was the second and third?",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","A good place to start is the—is the SEP,",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","but let me start with what I said,",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","which was that we’re going to be making decisions meeting by meeting based on the incoming data,",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","it’s a process of recalibrating our policy stance away from where we had it a year ago,",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","when inflation was high and unemployment low,",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","to a place that’s more appropriate given where we are now and where we expect to be.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","And that process will take place over time.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","There’s nothing in the—in the SEP that suggests the Committee is in a rush to will depend on the way the economy evolves.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","We can go quicker if that’s appropriate.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","We can go slower if that’s appropriate.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","We can pause if that’s appropriate.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","But that’s, that’s what we are contemplating.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","I would point you to the SEP as just an assessment of where—what the Committee is thinking today—what the individual members,",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","of the Committee are thinking today,",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","assuming that their particular forecasts take—you know,",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","I think it would—the way I would really characterize it is this:",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","I think people write down their estimate,",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","I think every single person on the Committee,",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","what’s your level of certainty around that,",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","they would say there’s a wide range where that could fall.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","There are model-based approaches and empirically based approaches that estimate what the neutral rate will be at any given time.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","But, realistically, we know it by its works.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","So that leaves us in a place where we’ll be—where we expect,",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","to be continuing to remove restriction,",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","and we’ll be looking at the way the economy reacts to that.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","And that’ll be guiding us in our thinking about the question that we’re asking at every meeting,",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","is our policy stance the appropriate one?",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","is up to 4.2 percent; inflation’s down to a few tenths above 2.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","So we know that it is time to recalibrate our policy to something that is more appropriate given the progress on inflation and on employment moving to a more sustainable level.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","So the balance of risks are now even.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","And this is the beginning of that process I mentioned,",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","the direction of which is toward a sense of neutral,",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","and we’ll move as fast or as slow as we think is appropriate in real time.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","What you have is our individual—accumulation of individual estimates of what that will be in the base case.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","I think we had a good—a good discussion.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","You know, if you go back, I talked about this at Jackson Hole, but I didn’t address the question of the size of the cut and left it open, and I think we left it open going into blackout.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","And so there was a lot of discussion back and forth, good diversity of—excellent discussion today.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","I think there was also broad support for the decision that the Committee voted on.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","So I would add, though, look at the",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","We’re going to take it meeting by meeting, as I mentioned.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","There’s no sense that the Committee feels it’s in a rush to do this.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","a sign of our confidence—confidence that inflation is,",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","is coming down toward 2 percent on a sustainable basis.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","We can, you know, make a good, strong start.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","But—and I’m very pleased that we did.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","both from an economic standpoint and also from a risk-management standpoint,",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","But I think we’re going to go carefully,",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","and make our decisions as we go.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","So, again, the labor market is actually in solid condition, and our intention with our policy move today is to keep it there.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","You can say that about the whole economy.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","Okay, multiple questions in there.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","So I would say we don’t think we’re behind.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","We do not think—we think this is timely, but I think you can take this as a sign of our commitment not to get behind.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","Sorry, your other question was?",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","So I think it’s about—we come into this with a policy position that was put in place,",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","which was a time of high inflation and very low unemployment.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","We’ve been very patient about, about reducing the policy rate.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","Other central banks around the world have cut, many of them several times.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","and I think that that patience has really paid dividends in the form of our confidence that inflation is moving sustainably under 2 percent.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","So I think that is what enables us to take this, this strong move today.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","I do not think that anyone should look at this and say,",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","this is the new pace.” You know,",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","you have to think about it in terms of the base case.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","Of course, what happens will happen.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","what you see is—look at the SEP,",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","The sense of this is we’re recalibrating policy down over time to a more neutral level.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","And we’re moving at the pace that we think is appropriate given",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","So, in the current situation, reserves have really been stable.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","So reserves are still abundant and expected to remain so for some time.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","the shrinkage in our balance sheet has really come out of the overnight RRP [facility].",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","So I think what that tells you is,",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","about stopping runoff because of this at all.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","We know that these two things can happen side by side.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","they’re both a form of normalization,",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","you can have the balance sheet shrinking but also be cutting rates.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","So I think what we’re seeing is,",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","clearly labor market conditions have cooled off by any measure,",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","as I talked about in Jackson Hole,",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","and—but they’re still at a level— the level of those conditions is actually pretty close to what I would call maximum employment.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","the labor market has returned to or below 2019 levels,",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","but this is more sort of 2018,",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","So the labor market bears close—bears close watching, and we’ll be giving it that.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","with an appropriate recalibration of our policy,",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","that we can continue to see the economy growing,",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","and that will support the labor market.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","if you look at the growth in economic activity data,",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","retail sales data that we just got,",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","second-quarter GDP—all of this indicates an economy that is still growing at a solid pace.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","So that should also support the labor market over time.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","So—but again, we’re—it bears watching.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","has been to begin to recalibrate and we’re—as you know,",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","we’re not seeing rising claims,",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","we’re not seeing rising layoffs,",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","and we’re not hearing that from companies that that’s something that’s getting ready to happen.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","So we’re not waiting for that,",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","there is—there is thinking that the time to support the labor market is when—is when it’s strong and not when we begin to see the layoffs.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","So that’s the situation we’re in.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","and we’ll be watching—and that’ll be one of the factors that we consider.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","we’re going to look at the totality of the data as we make these decisions meeting by meeting.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","We’re going to be watching all of the data, right?",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","So if—as I mentioned in my remarks, if the labor market were to slow unexpectedly, then we have the ability to react to that by, by cutting faster.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","We’re also going to be looking at our other mandate, though.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","We are more—we have greater confidence now that inflation is moving down to 2 percent, but, at the same time, our plan is that we will be at 2 percent, you know, over time.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","So—and policy, we think, is still restrictive, so that should still be happening.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","we don’t think we need to see further loosening in labor market conditions to get inflation down to 2 percent.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","and I think you can take this whole action as—take a step back,",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","what have we been trying to achieve?",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","We’re trying to achieve a situation where we restore price stability without the kind of painful increase in unemployment that has come sometimes with disinflation.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","That’s what we’re trying to do.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","And I think you can take today’s action as a sign of our strong commitment to achieve that goal.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","So we’ll start with unemployment, which is the single most important one probably.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","you know—I know it’s higher than we were used to seeing,",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","numbers in the mid- and even below mid-3s last year,",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","if you look back over the sweep of the years,",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","That’s a very healthy unemployment rate.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","And anything in the low 4s is, is a really—is a good labor market.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","Participation is at high levels.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","It’s, you know—we’ve had—we’re right—adjusted for demographics for aging, participation’s at pretty high levels.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","Wages are still a bit above what would be their—wage increases,",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","are still just a bit above where they would be over the very longer term to be consistent with 2 percent inflation,",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","but they’re very much coming down to what that sustainable level is.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","Vacancies over—per unemployed is back to what is still a very strong level.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","That number reached two to one, two vacancies for every unemployed person.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","As measured, it’s now below—it’s around one.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","But that’s still—that’s still a very good number, I would say.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","You know, quits have come back down to normal levels.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","There are many, many employment indicators.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","They say this is still a solid labor market.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","the question is that there has been change,",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","particularly over the last few months,",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","to inflation have really come down,",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","the position to manage the risks to both of our goals.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","You know, more data, the usual.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","We’ll see another labor report.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","We’ll see another jobs report.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","actually— we get two—we get a second jobs report on the day of the meeting,",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","on the Friday before the meeting.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","look at the incoming data and ask what are the implications of that data for the evolving outlook and the balance of risks and then go through our process and think,",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","Is policy where we want it to be to foster the achievement of our goals over time?",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","So that’s what it is, and that’s what we’ll be doing.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","So, on the job creation, it depends on—it depends on the inflows, right?",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","if you’re having millions of people come into the labor force then,",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","and you’re creating influx across the borders,",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","and that has actually been one of the things that’s,",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","that’s allowed the unemployment rate to rise.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","And the other thing is just the slower hiring rate,",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","which is something we also watch carefully.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","So it does depend on what’s happening on the supply side.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","On the Beveridge curve question,",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","but I think everyone on the Committee felt that job openings were so elevated that they could fall a long way before you hit the part of the curve where job openings turned into higher unemployment,",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","I think we are—it’s hard to know that—you can’t know these things with great precision,",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","but certainly it appears that we’re very close to that point,",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","so that further declines in job openings will translate more directly into unemployment.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","But it’s been— it’s been a great ride down.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","of tightness come out of the labor market in that form without it resulting in lower employment.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","So this is a question—and you mean after we get through all of this?",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","It’s just—great question that we just, we can only speculate about.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","would say we’re probably not going back to that era where there were trillions of dollars of sovereign bonds trading at negative rates—long-term bonds trading at is that we’re not going back to that.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","But, you know, honestly, we’re going to find out.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","it feels—it feels to me that the neutral rate is probably significantly higher than it was back then.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","I don’t—I just don’t think we know.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","It’s—again, we only know it by its works.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","this is my fourth presidential election at the Fed,",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","We’re always—we’re always going into this meeting,",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","what’s the right thing to do for the people we serve?",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","and we make a decision as a group,",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","And it’s—that’s always what it is.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","It’s never about anything else.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","and I would also point out that the things that we do really affect economic conditions for the most part with a lag.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","So, nonetheless, this is what we do.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","Our job is to support the economy on behalf of the American people.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","And, if we get it right, this will benefit the American people significantly.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","So this really concentrates the mind,",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","it’s something we all take very,",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","We don’t put up any other filters.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","I think if you start doing that, I don’t know where you stop.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","So inflation, you know—what we say is we want inflation—the goal is to have inflation move down to 2 percent on a sustainable basis.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","And, you know, we’re not really—we’re close, but we’re not really at 2 percent.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","And I think we’re going to want to see it be, you know, around 2 percent and close to 2 percent for some time, but we’re certainly not doing—we’re not saying “mission accomplished” or anything like that.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","But I have to say, though, we’re encouraged by the progress that we have made.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","So housing inflation is the—is the one piece that is kind of dragging a bit,",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","We know that market rents are doing what we would want them to do,",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","which slower than we expected.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","I think we now understand that it’s going to take some time for those lower market rents to get into this.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","the direction of travel is clear,",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","and as long as market rents remain,",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","just the time it’s taking now,",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","several years rather than just one or two cycles of annual lease renewals.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","So that’s—I think we understand that now,",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","but I don’t think the outcome is in doubt again.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","As long as market rents remain under control, the outcome is not as in doubt.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","So I would say it’s—the rest of the portfolio—or of the elements that go into core PCE inflation have behaved pretty well.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","You know, they’re all—they all have some volatility.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","We will get down to 2 percent inflation,",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","we’ll get what we need to get out of the housing services piece,",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","it’s hard to—it’s a game that—the housing market is in part frozen because of lock-in with low rates.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","People don’t want to sell their homes.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","So, because they have a very low mortgage, it would be quite expensive to refinance.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","people will start to move more,",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","and that’s probably beginning to happen already.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","but you’ve also got a new buyer in many cases.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","So it’s not, you know, obvious how much additional demand that would make.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","the real issue with housing is that we have had,",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","and are on track to continue to have,",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","And so it’s going to be challenging.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","It’s hard to find—to zone lots that are in places really fix.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","But I think, as we normalize rates, you’ll see the housing market normalize.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","ultimately by getting inflation broadly down and getting those rates normalized and getting the housing cycle normalized,",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","that’s the best thing we can do for house holders.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","And then the supply question will have to be dealt with by the market and also by government.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","So you’re right about lags, but I would just point to the overall economy.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","You have an economy that is growing at a solid pace.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","If you look at forecasters or talk to companies, they’ll say that they think 2025 should be a good year, too.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","That’s—from our standpoint, I can’t really speak to mortgage rates.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","I will say that’ll depend on how the economy evolves.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","Our intention, though, is—we think that our policy was appropriately restrictive.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","We think that it’s time to begin the process of recalibrating it to a level that’s more neutral,",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","We expect that process to take some time,",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","as you can see in the projections that we released today.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","And as—if things work out according to that forecast,",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","other rates in the economy will come down as well.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","the rate at which those things happen will really depend on how the economy performs.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","We can’t see—we can’t look a year ahead and know what the economy is to be doing—going to be doing.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","what I can say to the public is that we had the highest—we had a burst of inflation.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","Many other countries around the world had a similar burst of inflation,",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","part of the answer is that we raise interest rates in order to cool the economy off in order to reduce inflationary pressures.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","It’s not something that people experience as pleasant,",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","what you get is low inflation restored,",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","And a good definition of price stability is that people in their daily decisions,",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","they’re not thinking about inflation anymore.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","That’s where everyone wants to be, is back to what’s inflation, you know?",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","Just keep it low, keep it stable.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","So what we’re going through now really restores—it will benefit people over a long period of time.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","Price stability benefits everybody over a long period of time,",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","just by virtue of the fact that they don’t have to deal with inflation.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","So that’s what’s been going on, and I think we’ve made real progress.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","I completely—we don’t tell people how to think about the economy, of course.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","And, of course, people are [still] experiencing high prices, as opposed to high inflation.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","And we understand that’s painful.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","We’re always going to try to do what we think is the right thing for the economy at that time.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","So we will continue to look at that broad array of labor market data,",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","we’ll certainly look at those,",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","but we will mentally tend to adjust them based on the QCEW adjustment,",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","it will be—the unemployment rate’s very important,",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","but there isn’t a single statistic or single bright line over which that thing that might move that would dictate one thing or another.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","we’ll look at all the data on inflation,",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","and we’ll make decisions about,",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","is our policy stance where it needs to be to foster over the medium term our mandate goals?",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","So I can’t—I can’t say we have a bright line in mind.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","So countries that are—democracies around the world,",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","countries that are sort of like the United States,",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","all have what are called independent central banks.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","And the reason is that people have found over time that insulating the central bank from direct control by political authorities avoids making monetary policy in a way that favors maybe people who are in office as opposed to people who are not in office.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","I think the data are clear that countries that have independent central banks,",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","And so we’re, we’re not—we do our work to serve all Americans.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","We’re not serving any politician, any political figure, any cause, any issue, nothing.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","It’s just maximum employment and price stability on behalf of all Americans.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","And that’s how the other central banks are set up, too.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","It’s a good institutional arrangement,",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","which has been good for the public and I hope—and I hope and strongly believe that it will continue.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","You know what, hold the second question.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","We’ll give you the second question.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","So the answer to your question is that,",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","those changes were negotiated between the agencies with my support and with my involvement,",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","with the idea that we were going to re-propose,",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","re-propose the changes that Vice Chair Barr talked about and then take comment on them.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","So, yes, that is—that’s happening with my support.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","That’s not a final proposal, though, you understand.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","We’re putting them out for comment.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","We’re going to take comment and make appropriate changes.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","We don’t have a—we don’t have a calendar date for that,",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","the idea is that we’re all moving together,",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","so that—I don’t know exactly where that is.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","But the idea is that we will move as a group to put this,",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","it’ll—the comments will come back 60 days later,",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","and we’ll try to bring this to a conclusion sometime in the first half of next year.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","You know, I would—I would bounce that question to Vice Chair Barr.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","It’s a good question, but I don’t have that today.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","No, I think—I think, and we think, they are now roughly balanced.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","So if you go back for a long time, the risks were on inflation.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","We had a historically tight labor market, historically tight.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","There was a severe labor shortage, so very hot labor market.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","And we had inflation way above target.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","So, you know, that said to us, concentrate on inflation, concentrate on inflation.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","that the stance that we put in place 14 months ago was a stance that was focused on bringing down inflation.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","Part of bringing down inflation,",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","is cooling off the economy and a little bit cooling off the labor market.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","You now have a cooler labor market, in part because of our activity.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","So what that tells you is, it’s time to change our stance.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","The sense of the change in the stance is that we’re recalibrating our policy over time to a stance that will be more neutral.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","And today was—I think we made a good strong start on that.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","I think it was the right decision,",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","and I think it should send a signal that we,",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","that we’re committed to coming up with a good outcome here.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","I don’t—there’s—as I look—well, let me look at it this way: I don’t see anything in the economy right now that suggests that the likelihood of a solid levels.",""
"2024-09-18","Q&A","So, so I don’t really see that, no.",""
"2024-11-07","Opening Statement","My colleagues and I remain squarely focused on achieving our dual-mandate goals of maximum employment and stable prices for the benefit of the American people.",""
"2024-11-07","Opening Statement","The economy is strong overall and has made significant progress toward our goals over the past two years.",""
"2024-11-07","Opening Statement","The labor market has cooled from its formerly overheated state and remains solid.",""

"2024-11-07","Opening Statement","the FOMC decided to take another step in reducing the degree of policy restraint by lowering our policy interest rate by ¼ percentage point.",""
"2024-11-07","Opening Statement","We continue to be confident that,",""
"2024-11-07","Opening Statement","with an appropriate recalibration of our policy stance,",""
"2024-11-07","Opening Statement","strength in the economy and the labor market can be maintained,",""
"2024-11-07","Opening Statement","with inflation moving sustainably down to 2 percent.",""
"2024-11-07","Opening Statement","We also decided to continue to reduce our securities holdings.",""
"2024-11-07","Opening Statement","I’ll have more to say about monetary policy after briefly reviewing economic developments.",""

"2024-11-07","Q&A","you know—and I certainly have,",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","but it’s not really our job to provide our specific decomposition.",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","that it appears that the moves are not,",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","not principally about higher inflation expectations.",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","They’re really about a sense of more likely to have stronger growth and perhaps less in the way of downside risks.",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","You know, we do take financial conditions into account.",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","If they—if they’re persistent and if they’re material,",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","then we’ll certainly take them into account in our policy.",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","But I would say we’re not at—we’re not at that stage right now.",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","It’s just something that we’re watching.",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","these things don’t really have mainly to do with,",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","but to do with other factors in the economy.",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","It’s—you get halfway through the cycle between the last set and the next set.",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","I, I wouldn’t want to comment one way or the other.",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","You know, people are—let’s talk about the data we’ve gotten since the last meeting.",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","So, in the main, the economic activity data have been stronger than expected.",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","The NIPA revision was stronger.",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","Certainly, the September employment report was stronger; the October report, not stronger; retail sales, stronger.",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","I think you take away a sense of,",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","of some of the downside risks to economic activity having,",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","with the NIPA revisions in particular,",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","feeling good about economic activity.",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","So I think we would factor that in.",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","by December we’ll have—we’ll have more data:",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","I guess one more employment report,",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","we’ll make a decision as we get to December.",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","We don’t fill out a—we don’t fill out an SEP,",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","and I can’t characterize one that wasn’t filled out today.",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","So I can’t really speak for kind of exactly where the—where the Committee is.",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","in every meeting—we’re going to be looking at the incoming data and how that affects the outlook.",""

"2024-11-07","Q&A","But if you look at those two things,",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","we judged in September that it was appropriate to begin to recalibrate our policy stance to reflect this progress,",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","and today’s decision is really another step in that process.",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","we believe that with an appropriate recalibration of our policy stance,",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","we can maintain strength in the labor market even as our policy stance enables further progress toward our inflation goal.",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","So we haven’t, you know, made any decision like that at all.",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","But we’re—so we’re in the process,",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","of moving policy down—our stance down over time to a more neutral level.",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","we are prepared to adjust our assessments of the appropriate pace and destination as the outlook evolves.",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","if we were to see the labor market deteriorating,",""

"2024-11-07","Q&A","Again, haven’t made any decisions about that, but that’s certainly a possibility.",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","If you— you can think of it as similar to what we do with asset purchase—with asset runoff with QT.",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","Well, so I think if you look at the 3- and 6-month—you’re quoting the 12-month.",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","So we look at all of them, right?",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","But if you look at three- and six-month core PCE,",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","you’ll see they’re around 2.3 percent.",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","And we look at—we also—we look at 12 as well.",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","But what it’s telling us is that we really have made significant progress.",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","And we expect there to be bumps.",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","the last three months of last year,",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","the core PCE readings were very,",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","So that’s why you see—that’s why forecasts generally see a couple of upticks toward the end of the year.",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","the January reading certainly looks like an example of residual seasonality,",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","So when that falls out of the 12-month calculation in February,",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","we should see it staying down.",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","So there will literally be a bump up and then down.",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","One is the nonhousing services and goods,",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","which together make up 80 percent of that— of the core PCE index,",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","are back to the levels they were at the last time we had sustained 2 percent inflation,",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","which happens to be in the early 2000s for a period of five,",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","So they’re back at that level.",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","What’s not is housing services.",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","So let’s talk about housing services.",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","are experiencing very low inflation.",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","And what’s happening is older,",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","leases that are turning over are taking several years to catch up to where market,",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","market leases are—market rent leases are.",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","So that’s just a catch-up problem.",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","It’s not really reflecting current inflationary pressures; it’s reflecting past inflationary pressures.",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","I’d say look at the labor market—not a source of inflationary pressures.",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","It’s not a very tight economy.",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","What is the story about inflation?",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","You see that catch-up inflation also in insurance and in several other areas.",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","but we feel like the story is very consistent with inflation continuing to come down on a bumpy path over the next couple of years and settling around 2 percent.",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","and it won’t be one or two really good data months,",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","or bad data months aren’t going to really change the pattern at this point,",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","now that we’re this far into the process.",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","I’m not going to talk about anything that relates directly or indirectly to the election.",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","and it’s the one we think about all the time.",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","So I’ll just say a couple things.",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","significantly from a year or so ago.",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","So we’ve seen a big change upward in unemployment.",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","Sometimes that has meant bad things.",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","So far, it doesn’t appear to be.",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","It appears that the—I wouldn’t say that the labor market has fully stabilized,",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","because I do think it’s continuing to very gradually cool,",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","but it seems to be in a good place.",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","is designed to keep it in that good place,",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","to maintain the strength in the labor market,",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","while also enabling further progress on inflation.",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","You know, you mentioned a bunch of, of indicators, and you’re right.",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","You know, the, the openings to unemployment rate is back to a normal level.",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","I would—I would characterize it more broadly as “normalizing.” You mentioned wages.",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","Wages are still running just a bit above where they would need to be to be consistent with 2 percent inflation,",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","unless productivity is going to remain at this high level.",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","If we see the—if we see productivity,",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","more sustainably at these high levels,",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","then that would sustain higher wage gains.",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","that wage increases are now consistent with 2 percent inflation given current productivity readings.",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","the lore on productivity readings is whenever you see high readings,",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","you should assume they’re going to revert pretty quickly to the longer-term trend.",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","That has always been the case for 50 years.",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","But, you know, it may be that—we’re now five years.",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","If you look at the NIPA revisions that came out a month ago,",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","into a nice set of productivity readings,",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","which are sustained and very healthy.",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","But, overall, it’s a good labor market.",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","We could talk about 20 different data series.",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","We’ll be looking at all of them, of course.",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","So it’s hard to characterize a,",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","really interesting set of discussions we had,",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","you’ll see them in the minutes in three weeks.",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","the comments from our Reserve Bank colleagues and from the CEOs that they talk to are pretty constructive on the economy right now—pretty constructive,",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","feeling that the labor market is,",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","back to normal to the point where it’s no longer People feel good about where the economy is.",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","Demand is obviously pretty strong.",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","And, you know, you’re seeing, what, 2.8 percent growth in the third quarter estimated.",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","This is—this is—you know, this is a strong economy.",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","It’s actually remarkable how well the",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","I think it’s—you know, it’s things like—clearly, geopolitical risks around the world are elevated, and just as clearly, they’ve had relatively little effect on the",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","So, you know, I have said many times no more, no less than what the predecessors you mentioned have said.",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","to the new Administration’s policies at all,",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","we know—and I mentioned this in my statement—that the risks are two sided.",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","I guess I should start by saying that we think that the economy and we think our policy are both in a very good place,",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","“What are the risks?” And one risk is that we would move too quickly and find ourselves having moved too quickly,",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","and we—and we lost our chance to get inflation back to 2 percent.",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","So we have to avoid that risk.",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","And that, that—to avoid that risk, that means you want to move carefully.",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","The other risk is that we move too slowly and that we allow the labor market to weaken too much and do unnecessary damage to the labor market and to people’s working lives.",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","“Don’t get behind the curve.” So these are two—these two things are the two risks that we have to manage.",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","And so we’re, we’re in the middle there.",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","We try to be in the middle and deal with both of the—manage both of those.",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","the idea is to maintain support,",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","the strength that we have in the labor market and in the economy,",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","but also with somewhat less restrictive but still restrictive policy,",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","enable further progress toward our 2 percent inflation goal.",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","we’re going to be making our assessment of what the right path is.",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","neutral, a more neutral policy.",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","We don’t know exactly where that is; we only know it by its works.",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","We’re pretty sure it’s below where we are now.",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","But as we move further, there will be more uncertainty about where that is.",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","And we’re going to move carefully as,",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","we can increase the chances that we will get it right.",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","we would be concerned if we saw—if we thought we saw longer-term inflation expectations anchoring at a higher level.",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","We’re still seeing between surveys and market readings broadly consistent with—you know,",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","but it’s just not—it’s just—it’s kind of right where it’s been,",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","and also it’s pretty close to consistent with 2 percent PCE inflation.",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","So that’s one that’s been a traditional one that we look at a lot.",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","expectations seem to be—and really have throughout this—in a place that’s consistent with 2 percent inflation.",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","But you’re right to say we watch that very carefully,",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","and we will not allow inflation expectations to drift upward.",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","that’s really why we reacted so sharply back in 2022 was,",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","about what you’ve heard from business leaders on the economy,",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","but many average Americans are still not feeling the strength of the economy in their wallets.",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","So what’s your message to them on when they might expect relief?",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","we say that the economy is performing well,",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","but we also know that people are still feeling the effects of high prices,",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","And we went through—the world went through a global inflation shock,",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","and inflation went up everywhere.",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","it stays with you because the price level doesn’t come back down.",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","So what that takes is it takes some years of real wage gains for people to feel better.",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","And that’s what we’re—that’s what we’re trying to create.",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","And I think we’re well on the road to creating that.",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","The economy is still strong here.",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","Wages are moving up but, but at a sustainable level.",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","So it’s just—I think—I think what needs to happen is happening and,",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","But it’ll be some time before people, you know, regain their confidence and feel that.",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","And, you know, we don’t tell people how to—how to feel about the economy.",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","We respect—completely respect—what they’re feeling.",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","Those feelings are true; they’re accurate.",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","And just a quick follow-up—President-elect Trump has been critical of your performance.",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","Any concern about his influence on the Fed’s independence?",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","I’m not going—I’m not going to get into the—any of the political things here today, but thank you.",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","the whole plan is not to have stagflation,",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","so we don’t have to deal with it.",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","So that’s our—that is actually our plan.",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","a very difficult thing because you’re—you know,",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","you’re—anything you do with interest rates will,",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","will hurt one side or the other,",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","either the inflation mandate or the—or the employment mandate.",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","we’ve been able to see inflation come down a whole lot,",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","much closer to our goal without the kind of sharp increase in unemployment that has often accompanied programs of disinflation.",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","we’ve gotten this far without seeing a real weakening in,",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","And we believe we can complete the inflation task while also keeping the labor market strong,",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","is exactly what we’re trying to do.",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","I wouldn’t rule anything out or in that far away.",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","But that’s certainly not, not our plan.",""
"2024-11-07","Q&A","I mean, our baseline expectation is that we’ll continue to move gradually down towards neutral, that the economy will continue to grow at a healthy clip, and that the labor market will remain strong.",""

"2024-11-07","Q&A","And, you know, part of the problem there is that low inflation can be a problem, too, in a way.",""

"2024-12-18","Q&A","we—so remember that we couple this decision today with the “extent and timing” language in the postmeeting statement that signals that we are at or near a point at which it will be appropriate to slow the pace of further adjustments.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","I think that the lower—the slower pace of cuts for next year really reflects both the higher inflation readings we’ve had this year and the expectation that inflation will be higher.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","You saw in the SEP that risks and,",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","and uncertainty around inflation we see as higher.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","Nonetheless, we, we see ourselves as, as still on track to continue to cut.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","I think the actual cuts that we make next year will not be because of anything we wrote down today.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","to cut further after this point,",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","We’ve reduced our policy rate now by 100 basis points.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","We’re significantly closer to neutral.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","At 4.3 percent and “change,” we believe policy is still meaningfully restrictive.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","we’re going to be looking for further progress on inflation as well as continued strength in the labor market.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","And as long as the economy and the labor market are solid,",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","we can be cautious about—as we consider further cuts.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","And all of that is reflected—to your question—in the December SEP,",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","which shows a median forecast of down [to] two cuts next year,",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","compared to four in September.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","I’d point to five or six things,",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","and I’d start—let me start by saying that we think the economy’s in a really good place,",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","and we think policy’s in a really good place.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","Let’s remember that the economy’s growing 2½ percent this year,",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","First thing is growth is stronger, right?",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","the economy grew faster in the second half of 2024,",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","than we had expected and is expected to be above what our expectations in September next year as well.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","you’ll see that participants think that the—that the downside risks are less and uncertainty is less.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","And so that’s, that’s more strength, right?",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","Inflation is higher, as we talked about.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","It’s also higher in the forecast next year.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","I’d also point out that we’re,",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","we’re closer to the neutral rate,",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","which is another reason to be cautious about,",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","And—but then getting to your—to your point,",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","some people—the way I’d say it is this:",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","Some people did take a very preliminary step and start to incorporate highly conditional estimates of economic effects of policies into their forecast at this meeting and said so in the meeting.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","Some people said they didn’t do so,",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","didn’t say whether they did or not.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","So we have people making a bunch of different approaches to that.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","But some did identify policy uncertainty as one of the reasons for their,",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","their writing down more uncertainty around inflation.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","the point of that uncertainty is,",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","it’s kind of commonsense thinking that when the path is uncertain you go a little bit slower.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","It’s not unlike driving on a foggy night or walking into a dark room full of furniture.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","And so that may have affected some of the people.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","But as, as I said, there’s a range of—range of approaches on the Committee.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","you mentioned that the disinflationary story remains intact,",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","yet the risk weighting has jumped to the upside.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","The only real thing that’s happened is November 5th, in the meantime.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","Is it fair to say that that’s what’s driving the higher sense of upside risk on inflation?",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","Actually, that’s not the only thing that’s happened.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","What’s happened is that our forecast for inflation for this year,",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","are five-tenths higher than they were in September.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","So, you’ve got—you had two months of higher inflation, September and October.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","As I mentioned, November is, is back on track.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","we’ve had a year-end projection for inflation and it’s kind of fallen apart as we’ve approached the end of the year.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","So that is certainly a large factor in people’s thinking.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","I can tell you that might be the single biggest factor is inflation has once again underperformed relative to expectations.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","It’s still, you know, going to be between 2½ and 3 [percent].",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","we really want to see progress on inflation,",""

"2024-12-18","Q&A","we’re going to be looking for progress on inflation.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","We have been moving sideways on 12-month inflation as the 12-month window moves.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","That’s in part because inflation was very,",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","we’re going to want to be seeing further progress on bringing inflation down and keeping a solid labor market.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","the September 2018 Tealbook alternative simulations are a good place to start.",""

"2024-12-18","Q&A","one was—one was “seeing through,” one was not.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","And I point you to, you’ll— there’s some language in the—in the “see- through” paragraph.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","it considers situations in which it might be appropriate to “see through” inflation and then,",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","and then names some conditions that in,",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","In any case, this is not a question that’s in front of us right now.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","We, we won’t face that question—we don’t know when we’ll face that question.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","What the Committee’s doing now is,",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","is discussing pathways and understanding,",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","the ways in which tariff-driven inflation can affect—tariffs can affect inflation and the economy,",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","when we finally do see what the,",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","thoughtful assessment of what might be the appropriate policy response.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","the main thing is—and this is also a point in these alternative simulations—is that there’re just many,",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","many factors that go into what,",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","will even go into consumer inflation.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","very much at all about the actual policies,",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","so it’s very premature to try to make any kind of conclusion.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","We don’t know what’ll be tariffed, from what countries, for how long, and what size.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","We don’t know whether there’ll be, you know, retaliatory tariffs.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","the transmission of any of that will be into consumer prices.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","To your—to your point as well,",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","I don’t—I wouldn’t say that we know whether the last episode is or is not a good model for what happened.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","You pointed out we’ve just been through a period of high inflation.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","We’ve just gotten through that period.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","It was also quite a bit of diversion of trade away from China to other countries,",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","that may—that may have affects.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","and make a very careful assessment,",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","but only when we’ve actually seen what the policies are and how they’re implemented.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","And, you know, we’re just—we’re just not at that stage.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","We’re at the stage of doing what other forecasters are doing—which is kind of thinking about these questions,",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","not trying to get to definitive answers for some time.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","Let me—let me find these numbers.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","So we have—we have inflation coming down,",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","core inflation coming down to 2½ [percent] next year.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","That’s, that’d be—that’d be significant progress.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","I think that does take on board that we want to see real progress.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","we’d be seeing meaningful progress to get inflation down to that level.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","That wouldn’t be all the way to 2 percent,",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","This year, [it] will be 2.8 or 2.9.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","We, we also have to think about the, the, you know, the labor market.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","we have the labor market forecast as being in good shape,",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","we are also mindful that it is still out there very gradually cooling,",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","But it’s also something we need to keep our eye on.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","So that’s, that’s not the—that’s not any decision that we’ve made at all.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","Let me explain “extent and timing.” So the,",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","the sense of that wording is to make clear that if the economy does evolve about as anticipated,",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","we’re at a point at which it would be appropriate to slow the pace of rate cuts.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","So “extent,” that just relates to how,",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","how much further we can reduce our policy rate consistent with getting to a neutral stance.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","Clearly, that distance has shrunk by 100 basis points.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","So that’s, that’s the “extent” question.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","that we’re at a place where we,",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","assuming the economy develops as expected,",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","we’re at or near a level that will make it appropriate to slow the pace of adjustments.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","So that, that’s what we mean by that.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","We’re not trying to make decisions about the longer run.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","You know, we are, we’re trying to make sensible policy as we go.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","I just would emphasize the uncertainty,",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","it’s just—it’s just a function of the fact that,",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","that we expect significant policy changes.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","There’s nothing really unusual about that.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","we need to see what they are and see what the effects they will have.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","We’ll, we’ll have a much clearer picture, I think, you know, when that happens.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","the rates that you talked about are,",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","they are affected to some extent by Fed policy,",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","but they’re also affected by many other things.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","And longer rates have actually gone up quite a bit since September,",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","and those are the things that drive,",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","mortgage rates more than short-term rates do.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","but we look at all financial conditions,",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","and then we look at what’s happening in the economy.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","So what we see happening in the economy,",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","most forecasters have been calling for a slowdown in growth about at the same level.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","So confidence was our test for raising rates,",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","We’ve made just a great deal of progress.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","in core inflation and around 2½ [percent]—or even lower than that,",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","we have been—for headline inflation.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","I would say I’m confident that inflation has come down a great deal,",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","I’m confident in the story about why it’s come down and why that portends well.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","And I’ll—and I’ll tell you why.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","you do see with housing services inflation,",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","which is one that we’ve really worried,",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","it really has come down now quite steadily,",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","at a slower pace than we thought,",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","So that, that’s happening; that process is ongoing pretty much as we expect.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","which is another big piece of it,",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","has returned right to the range where it was before the pandemic.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","Just for some months this year it kind of moved up in a bumpy way because of used cars and things like that.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","But we think, overall, that should generally be in the range it was in.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","Then that leaves nonhousing services, and market-based nonhousing services are in, in good shape.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","and those are—those are services that are imputed rather than measured directly,",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","we think they don’t really tell us much about the,",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","about tightness in the economy.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","They don’t really reflect that.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","a good example is financial services,",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","which is really done off of asset prices,",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","that’s how that inflation works.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","the story of why inflation should be coming down,",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","In particular, the labor market—look at the labor market.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","it is cooler by so many measures now—modestly cooler than it was in 2019,",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","a year when inflation was well under 2 percent.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","So it’s not a source of inflationary pressures.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","Not to say there aren’t regional and,",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","particular professions where labor is tight.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","But, overall, you’re not getting inflationary impulses of any significance from the labor market.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","we’re unwinding from these large shocks that the economy got in 2021 and ’22 in,",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","and those are now being reflected later in housing insurance.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","It’s real inflation, but it doesn’t portend persistently high inflation.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","So we and most other forecasters still feel that we’re on track to,",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","the unemployment rate has now—is now the same as it was in July:",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","It’s moved up and down, but it’s now the same as July.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","but it’s been—it’s been steady—it’s not—it’s not declining.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","It’s been steady at a level which,",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","as I pointed out a couple times,",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","is actually below the level that would hold the unemployment rate constant,",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","and if jobs continue—job creation continues at that level in the establishment survey,",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","then you would get a tenth maybe every other month kind of thing.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","But we don’t have that kind of precision in this.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","So, but you’re right, though, and I, I read out some of the reasons.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","we do think the labor market is still cooling by many measures,",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","and we’re watching that closely.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","it’s not cooling in a—in a quick or in a way that really raises concerns.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","you pointed out participants in the FOMC really thought that the risks and uncertainty had improved relative watching it closely.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","we don’t think we need further softening to get to 2 percent inflation.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","That’s what I’m saying, not that it’s not welcome.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","We don’t need it, we don’t think.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","if you had a situation where inflation’s moving around by a tenth every few months,",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","we’d have to weigh that against the fact that inflation has in recent months been moving sideways in the 12-month window.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","And so we’ve got to weigh them both, at this point.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","for a while there we were only really focused mainly,",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","We’ve now gotten to a place where,",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","where the risks of the two are what we think are broadly,",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","And so that’s how we think about it.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","We’re not—we’re not renaming the phase—yet.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","But we may get around to that.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","in a new phase in the process,",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","So, and that’s just because we’ve reduced—we’ve reduced our policy rate by 100 basis points.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","We’re significantly closer to neutral.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","We still think where we are is meaningfully,",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","and I think from this point forward,",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","it’s appropriate to move support the decision,",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","and I think it was the right decision to make.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","I think from now we are in a place where the risks really are in balance,",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","and we need to see progress on inflation.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","And that’s, that’s how we’re thinking about it.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","We moved pretty quickly to get to here,",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","we’re going to be moving slower,",""

"2024-12-18","Q&A","We’ve seen the labor market cool off quite a bit.",""

"2024-12-18","Q&A","and it has come the labor market.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","Again, not something we need to see to get 2 percent inflation.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","that’s part of the reason that explains why we moved ahead today with,",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","the level of unemployment is very low—again,",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","Wages are at a healthy and, and ever more sustainable level—wage growth.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","And so the labor market—this is a good,",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","You know, we, we can’t know that with any tremendous certainty.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","I will say that we think that,",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","that our policy balances the risks—we think the risks are roughly in balance as between the two mandates,",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","and we think the labor market is,",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","And when I say it’s softening or cooling, it’s very gradual process.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","still a bit above what would be sustainable if productivity were to revert to its longer-run trend.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","if you take into account the high productivity readings we’ve had,",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","then wages are already at a sustainable level relative to 2 percent inflation.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","I don’t want to overstate the downside in the labor market,",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","because the downsides clearly appear to have diminished.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","it’s one of our mandate goals,",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","and that’s why we’re paying careful attention.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","it breaks down into a long answer,",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","but it just has been a little bit more stubborn.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","I think if you go back two or three years,",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","many people were saying that to get this far down we would’ve had to have a,",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","the path down has actually been much better than many predicted.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","to have the unemployment rate remain essentially at its longer-run natural rate,",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","while inflation has come down from—you know,",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","core PCE inflation has come down from 5.6 percent to 2.8 percent on a 12-month basis.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","So that’s, that’s a pretty good outcome.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","Why hasn’t it come down [more]?",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","that—just a technical issue around the way we calculate housing services,",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","that process has been slower than—market rents have,",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","are showing up more slowly in that measure than we might have thought three,",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","what I think people are feeling right now is the effect of high prices,",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","we understand very well that prices went up by a great deal,",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","And it’s advanced economies at the same time.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","So now we have—inflation itself is way down,",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","but people are still feeling high prices,",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","and that is—that is really what people are feeling.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","The best we can do for them—and that’s who we work for—is to get inflation back down to its target and keep it there so that people are earning,",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","real wage increases so that their,",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","their compensation is going up faster than inflation year upon year upon year.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","And that’s what will restore people’s good feeling about the economy.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","That’s what it will take, and that’s what we’re aiming for.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","I feel—I feel very good about where the economy is, and, honestly, I’m very optimistic about, about the economy, and it’s—we’re, we’re in a really good place;",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","our policy’s in a really good place.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","I, I expect another good year next year.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","when we write— the thing we write down in the Summary of Economic Projections is the longer-run neutral rate,",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","which is the neutral rate at a time when supply and demand are in balance,",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","the full economy’s in balance,",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","and no shocks are hitting the economy.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","That is not where we are right now.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","So when we’re making monetary policy at the Fed, that’s not the question we’re asking.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","in real time is we’re looking at our policy stance,",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","and we’re looking at the way it’s hitting the economy,",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","we look at the effects it’s having as we try to move the economy toward maximum employment and price stability.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","And the answer can be that there are things that affect the economy that are—that are lasting but not permanent.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","And the, the ones that are permanent are the ones that would be in r*.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","but nonetheless go away over time,",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","they could actually affect what,",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","what’s sort of technically the appropriate neutral stance in near term.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","we don’t—we don’t know exactly where it is,",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","what we know for sure is that we’re 100 basis points closer to it right now.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","There are many estimates of where that might be,",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","and we know we’re a lot closer to it,",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","and I think we’re in a good place.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","But I think from here it’s a new phase,",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","there are countless models of what—of what a neutral rate might be at any given time.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","there are things that combine them,",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","and they have as many different answers as you’d like.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","So there is no real certainty.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","it’s actually a good thing to know that we don’t know exactly where it is,",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","so you’re not—you’re not tempted to think,",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","that our policy works with long and variable lags.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","we’re— I think we need— it’s appropriate for us—for us now to proceed cautiously,",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","now that we’re 100 basis points closer to,",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","and these cuts will certainly help to support economic activity and the labor market while we can still make progress on inflation,",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","because policy is still meaningfully restrictive.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","the goal overall is headline inflation,",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","because that’s what people experience.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","People don’t experience core inflation; they experience inflation, and that includes food and energy costs.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","headline inflation contains energy and food,",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","and those prices can fluctuate for reasons that are not related to tightness in the economy and therefore are not really good predictors of future inflation.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","So it turns out that core inflation is,",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","is a better predictor of overall inflation than overall inflation is.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","So we look at core inflation because it’s a better measure of what future inflation is like to be,",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","because it’s a better measure of,",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","So headline can be affected—you’re talking about next year.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","Yeah, so headline can, again, it can be affected by energy prices and food prices.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","in the headline forecasts that are to do with forecasts of energy prices,",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","if you look at core going out a full year,",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","then it’ll be much more driven by things like tightness in the economy.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","So it—that, that’s why the two can go in different directions.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","but that’s because energy prices have been coming down,",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","which is a great thing for people.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","But energy prices will come down,",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","and it won’t really be telling us anything about how tight the economy is and how,",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","how future inflation will perform.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","So we, we monitor geopolitical risks really quickly, but, you know, but—really carefully, rather.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","I would say so far those risks haven’t really— nothing has come out of those risks that really,",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","has really been important for the United States economy.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","The single thing that you would look to is the price of oil,",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","given that we’re talking about the Middle East and Ukraine,",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","that is a good summary statistic for the kind of thing that could go wrong in,",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","But the price of oil’s been coming down,",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","we don’t overreact to a couple of months of higher readings or a couple months of lower readings.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","what we had was—we had four months of really nice readings,",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","and then September and October were higher,",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","but then November is much lower.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","So I don’t really think the public is experiencing that as a surprising upside risk to inflation.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","I, I think inflation is much lower.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","are just—the price level went up,",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","because of the past inflation.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","It is going to take some time to,",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","over a period of years in which your,",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","your real compensation is growing.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","And, in other words, your compensation’s growing meaningfully faster than inflation.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","That’s exactly the kind of economy we have now,",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","and we just want to hold onto it.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","that process will probably take some years,",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","that’s what’s going on right now.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","a couple of months of higher inflation really signal that,",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","anything of the nature you’re suggesting.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","And just one follow-up: Let’s look more long-term.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","You previously predicted hitting the 2 percent inflation target in 2026.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","We’re talking about—when you’re projecting the economy,",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","you’re talking about high uncertainty.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","it’s not possible to confidently predict where the economy is going to be in three years.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","So what we’re doing is we’re looking at what’s happening now.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","And we’re kind of projecting that the same kinds of things are happening—so we,",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","we keep a strong labor market,",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","housing services inflation comes down,",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","goods and services—goods inflation settles down,",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","nonmarket services return to their,",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","All of those things should happen over time,",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","There’s every reason to think that they will.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","The timing of it is highly uncertain.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","the— it’s been a bit frustrating because the—while we’ve made progress,",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","it has been slower than we had hoped.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","Nonetheless, we’re still on track.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","“we were [going to be] at 4.2 percent unemployment and 2.8 percent inflation,” people would be,",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","that’s a pretty good interim place to be.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","we’re feeling good about where we are and where we’re headed.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","You don’t rule things completely in or out in this—in this world.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","That doesn’t appear to be a likely outcome.",""
"2024-12-18","Q&A","That’s, that’s meaningfully restrictive, and I, I think it’s a well-calibrated rate for us to continue to make progress on inflation while, while keeping a, a strong labor market.",""
