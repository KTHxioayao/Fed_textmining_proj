2018-10-02,Monetary Policy and Risk Management at a Time of Low Inflation and Low Unemployment,"For example, the medians of the most recent projections from FOMC participants and the Survey of Professional Forecasters, as well as the most recent Congressional Budget Office (CBO) forecast, all have the unemployment rate remaining below 4 percent through the end of 2020, with inflation staying very near 2 percent over the same period.1",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20181002a.htm

2018-10-02,Monetary Policy and Risk Management at a Time of Low Inflation and Low Unemployment,"Since 1950, the U.S. economy has experienced periods of low, stable inflation and periods of very low unemployment, but never both for such an extended time as is seen in these forecasts.2Standard economic thinking has long offered an explanation for this: If unemployment were to remain this low for this long, employers would be pushing up wages as they compete for scarce workers, and rising labor costs would feed into more‑rapid price inflation faced by consumers.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20181002a.htm

2018-10-02,Monetary Policy and Risk Management at a Time of Low Inflation and Low Unemployment,The first is to explain how changes in the Phillips curve help account for the somewhat surprising but broadly shared current forecasts of continued very low unemployment with inflation near 2 percent.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20181002a.htm
2018-10-02,Monetary Policy and Risk Management at a Time of Low Inflation and Low Unemployment,"At the risk of spoiling the surprise, I do not see it as likely that the Phillips curve is dead, or that it will soon exact revenge.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20181002a.htm
2018-10-02,Monetary Policy and Risk Management at a Time of Low Inflation and Low Unemployment,"What is more likely, in my view, is that many factors, including better conduct of monetary policy over the past few decades, have greatly reduced, but not eliminated, the effects that tight labor markets have on inflation.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20181002a.htm

2018-10-02,Monetary Policy and Risk Management at a Time of Low Inflation and Low Unemployment,"While our inflation objective concerns headline inflation, switching to core inflation makes some relationships clearer by removing a good deal of variability due to food and energy prices, variability that is not primarily driven by labor market conditions or monetary policy.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20181002a.htm

2018-10-02,Monetary Policy and Risk Management at a Time of Low Inflation and Low Unemployment,"In standard economic thinking, an unemployment rate above the natural rate indicates slack in the labor market and tends to be associated with downward pressure on inflation; unemployment below the natural rate represents a tight labor market and is associated with upward inflation pressure.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20181002a.htm

2018-10-02,Monetary Policy and Risk Management at a Time of Low Inflation and Low Unemployment,"As I discussed in a recent speech, many analysts have accounted for the lack of rising inflation pressure by lowering their estimate of the natural rate.19For example, since the start of 2016, the unemployment rate has fallen about 1 percentage point, and estimates of the natural rate from four well-known sources have fallen over that period between 0.3 percent and 0.7 percent (figure 9).",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20181002a.htm

2018-08-24,Monetary Policy in a Changing Economy,"Fifteen years ago, during the period now referred to as the Great Moderation, the topic of this symposium was ""Adapting to a Changing Economy.""",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180824a.htm

2018-08-24,Monetary Policy in a Changing Economy,"""1On the doorstep of the period now referred to as the Global Financial Crisis, surely few, if any, at that symposium would have imagined how shockingly different the next 15 years would be from the 15 years that preceded it.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180824a.htm

2018-08-24,Monetary Policy in a Changing Economy,I will explain today why the Committee's consensus view is that this gradual process of normalization remains appropriate.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180824a.htm

2018-08-24,Monetary Policy in a Changing Economy,In keeping with the spirit of this year's symposium topic--the changing structures of the economy--I would also note briefly that the U.S. economy faces a number of longer-term structural challenges that are mostly beyond the reach of monetary policy.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180824a.htm
2018-08-24,Monetary Policy in a Changing Economy,"For example, real wages, particularly for medium- and low-income workers, have grown quite slowly in recent decades.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180824a.htm
2018-08-24,Monetary Policy in a Changing Economy,"Economic mobility in the United States has declined and is now lower than in most other advanced economies.2Addressing the federal budget deficit, which has long been on an unsustainable path, becomes increasingly important as a larger share of the population retires.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180824a.htm

2018-08-24,Monetary Policy in a Changing Economy,"My FOMC colleagues and I believe that we can best support progress on these longer-term issues by pursuing the Federal Reserve's mandate and supporting continued economic growth, a strong labor market, and inflation near 2 percent.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180824a.htm
2018-08-24,Monetary Policy in a Changing Economy,The topic of managing uncertainty in policymaking remains particularly salient.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180824a.htm
2018-08-24,Monetary Policy in a Changing Economy,I will focus today on one of the many facets of uncertainty discussed at the 2003 symposium--uncertainty around the location of important macroeconomic variables such as the natural rate of unemployment.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180824a.htm
2018-08-24,Monetary Policy in a Changing Economy,A good place to start is with two opposing questions that regularly arise in discussions of monetary policy both inside and outside the Fed:,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180824a.htm
2018-08-24,Monetary Policy in a Changing Economy,"With the unemployment rate well below estimates of its longer-term normal level, why isn't the FOMC tightening monetary policy more sharply to head off overheating and inflation?",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180824a.htm
2018-08-24,Monetary Policy in a Changing Economy,"With no clear sign of an inflation problem, why is the FOMC tightening policy at all, at the risk of choking off job growth and continued expansion?",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180824a.htm
2018-08-24,Monetary Policy in a Changing Economy,"These questions strike me as representing the two errors that the Committee is always seeking to avoid as expansions continue--moving too fast and needlessly shortening the expansion, versus moving too slowly and risking a destabilizing overheating.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180824a.htm
2018-08-24,Monetary Policy in a Changing Economy,"As I will discuss, the job of avoiding these errors is made challenging today because the economy has been changing in ways that are difficult to detect and measure in real time.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180824a.htm
2018-08-24,Monetary Policy in a Changing Economy,I will first lay out a standard view of a handful of basic relationships that are thought to reflect key aspects of the underlying structure of the economy.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180824a.htm
2018-08-24,Monetary Policy in a Changing Economy,"I will then use that framework to explain the role that structural change plays in our current policy deliberations, focusing on how that role has been shaped by two historical episodes.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180824a.htm
2018-08-24,Monetary Policy in a Changing Economy,"Conventional Views of Macroeconomic StructureIn conventional models of the economy, major economic quantities such as inflation, unemployment, and the growth rate of gross domestic product (GDP) fluctuate around values that are considered ""normal,"" or ""natural,"" or ""desired.""",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180824a.htm
2018-08-24,Monetary Policy in a Changing Economy,The FOMC has chosen a 2 percent inflation objective as one of these desired values.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180824a.htm
2018-08-24,Monetary Policy in a Changing Economy,"The other values are not directly observed, nor can they be chosen by anyone.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180824a.htm
2018-08-24,Monetary Policy in a Changing Economy,"Instead, these values result from myriad interactions throughout the economy.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180824a.htm
2018-08-24,Monetary Policy in a Changing Economy,"In the FOMC's quarterly Summary of Economic Projections (SEP), participants state their individual views on the longer-run normal values for the growth rate of GDP, the unemployment rate, and the federal funds rate.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180824a.htm
2018-08-24,Monetary Policy in a Changing Economy,"These fundamental structural features of the economy are also known by more familiar names such as the ""natural rate of unemployment"" and ""potential output growth.""",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180824a.htm
2018-08-24,Monetary Policy in a Changing Economy,"The longer-run federal funds rate minus long-run inflation is the ""neutral real interest rate.""",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180824a.htm
2018-08-24,Monetary Policy in a Changing Economy,"At the Fed and elsewhere, analysts talk about these values so often that they have acquired shorthand names.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180824a.htm
2018-08-24,Monetary Policy in a Changing Economy,"For example, u* (pronounced ""u star"") is the natural rate of unemployment, r* (""r star"") is the neutral real rate of interest, and Π* (""pi star"") is the inflation objective.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180824a.htm
2018-08-24,Monetary Policy in a Changing Economy,"According to the conventional thinking, policymakers should navigate by these stars.3In that sense, they are very much akin to celestial stars.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180824a.htm
2018-08-24,Monetary Policy in a Changing Economy,"For example, the famous Taylor rule calls for setting the federal funds rate based on where inflation and unemployment stand in relation to the stars.4If inflation is higher than Π*, raise the real federal funds rate relative to r*.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180824a.htm
2018-08-24,Monetary Policy in a Changing Economy,"The higher real interest rate will, through various channels, tend to moderate spending by businesses and households, which will reduce upward pressure on prices and wages as the economy cools off.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180824a.htm
2018-08-24,Monetary Policy in a Changing Economy,"In contrast, if the unemployment rate is above u*, lower the real federal funds rate relative to r*, which will stimulate spending and raise employment.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180824a.htm
2018-08-24,Monetary Policy in a Changing Economy,Navigating by the stars can sound straightforward.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180824a.htm
2018-08-24,Monetary Policy in a Changing Economy,"Guiding policy by the stars in practice, however, has been quite challenging of late because our best assessments of the location of the stars have been changing significantly.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180824a.htm
2018-08-24,Monetary Policy in a Changing Economy,"Shifting Stars during NormalizationIn December 2013, the FOMC began winding down the final crisis-era asset purchase program.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180824a.htm
2018-08-24,Monetary Policy in a Changing Economy,"Asset purchases declined to zero over 2014, and in December 2015, the FOMC began the gradual normalization of interest rates that continues to this day.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180824a.htm
2018-08-24,Monetary Policy in a Changing Economy,"As normalization has proceeded, FOMC participants and many other private- and public-sector analysts regularly adjusted their assessments of the stars (figure 1).",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180824a.htm
2018-08-24,Monetary Policy in a Changing Economy,"Many projections of the natural rate of unemployment fell roughly 1 full percentage point, as did assessments of the neutral interest rate.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180824a.htm
2018-08-24,Monetary Policy in a Changing Economy,Estimates of the potential growth rate of GDP slipped about 1/2 percentage point.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180824a.htm
2018-08-24,Monetary Policy in a Changing Economy,These changing assessments have big implications.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180824a.htm
2018-08-24,Monetary Policy in a Changing Economy,"For example, the 1 percentage point fall in the neutral interest rate implies that the federal funds rate was considerably closer to its longer-run normal and, hence, that policy was less accommodative than thought at the beginning of normalization.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180824a.htm
2018-08-24,Monetary Policy in a Changing Economy,The 1 percentage point fall in the natural rate of unemployment implies at present that about 1.6 million more people would have jobs when unemployment is at its longer-run level.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180824a.htm
2018-08-24,Monetary Policy in a Changing Economy,These shifts in the stars generally reflect analysts' attempts to square their estimates with arriving macroeconomic data.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180824a.htm
2018-08-24,Monetary Policy in a Changing Economy,"For example, as the unemployment rate fell toward, and then below, estimates of its natural rate, many expected inflation to move up.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180824a.htm
2018-08-24,Monetary Policy in a Changing Economy,"When inflation instead moved sideways, a reasonable inference was that the natural rate was lower than previously thought.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180824a.htm
2018-08-24,Monetary Policy in a Changing Economy,"Further, over this period, GDP growth was slower than one might have expected based on the rapid decline in unemployment and the well-known relationship between output and unemployment known as Okun's law.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180824a.htm
2018-08-24,Monetary Policy in a Changing Economy,"Put another way, labor productivity growth consistently disappointed, which raised the question of whether that shortfall was temporary‑‑perhaps due to headwinds from the crisis--or was part of a new normal.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180824a.htm
2018-08-24,Monetary Policy in a Changing Economy,These assessments of the values of the stars are imprecise and subject to further revision.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180824a.htm
2018-08-24,Monetary Policy in a Changing Economy,"To return to the nautical metaphor, the FOMC has been navigating between the shoals of overheating and premature tightening with only a hazy view of what seem to be shifting navigational guides.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180824a.htm
2018-08-24,Monetary Policy in a Changing Economy,"Our approach to this challenge has been shaped by two much discussed historical episodes--the Great Inflation of the 1960s and 1970s and the ""new economy"" period of the late 1990s.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180824a.htm
2018-08-24,Monetary Policy in a Changing Economy,"Shifting Stars and the Great InflationWhile the crisis and its aftermath have been extraordinary in many ways, the shifting of the stars is not one of them.Figure 2illustrates the Congressional Budget Office's (CBO) current estimate of movements in the natural rate of unemployment and potential GDP growth from 1960 to 2000.5Viewed against the ups and downs observed over these four decades, the recent shifts in longer-run values are not all that dramatic.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180824a.htm
2018-08-24,Monetary Policy in a Changing Economy,"Of course, these CBO estimates benefit from many years of hindsight, whereas monetary policy must be based on assessments made in real time.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180824a.htm
2018-08-24,Monetary Policy in a Changing Economy,The Great Inflation period vividly illustrates the difficulties this difference raises.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180824a.htm

2018-08-24,Monetary Policy in a Changing Economy,"Multiple factors, including monetary policy errors, contributed to the Great Inflation.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180824a.htm
2018-08-24,Monetary Policy in a Changing Economy,"Many researchers have concluded that a key mistake was that monetary policymakers placed too much emphasis on imprecise--and, as it turns out, overly optimistic--real-time estimates of the natural rate of unemployment.6",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180824a.htm
2018-08-24,Monetary Policy in a Changing Economy,Figure 3compares the CBO's current view of the natural rate of unemployment in that era with an estimate by Athanasios Orphanides and John Williams of the rate as policymakers perceived it in real time.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180824a.htm
2018-08-24,Monetary Policy in a Changing Economy,"From 1965 to the early 1980s, this real-time estimate of u* was well below where hindsight now places it.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180824a.htm
2018-08-24,Monetary Policy in a Changing Economy,"The unemployment rate over this period was generally well above the real-time natural rate, and contemporary documents reveal that policymakers were wary of pushing the unemployment rate even further above u* (figure 4, top panel).7With the benefit of hindsight, we now think that, except for a few years in the mid-1970s, the labor market was tight and contributing to inflation's rise (figure 4, lower panel).",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180824a.htm
2018-08-24,Monetary Policy in a Changing Economy,It is now clear that the FOMC had placed too much emphasis on its imprecise estimates of u* and too little emphasis on evidence of rising inflation expectations.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180824a.htm
2018-08-24,Monetary Policy in a Changing Economy,"The Great Inflation did, however, prompt an ""expectations revolution"" in macroeconomic thinking, with one overwhelmingly important lesson for monetary policymakers: Anchoring longer-term inflation expectations is a vital precondition for reaching all other monetary policy goals.8",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180824a.htm
2018-08-24,Monetary Policy in a Changing Economy,"When longer-term inflation expectations are anchored, unanticipated developments may push inflation up or down, but people expect that inflation will return fairly promptly to the desired value.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180824a.htm
2018-08-24,Monetary Policy in a Changing Economy,This is the key insight at the heart of the widespread adoption of inflation targeting by central banks in the wake of the Great Inflation.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180824a.htm
2018-08-24,Monetary Policy in a Changing Economy,Anchored expectations give a central bank greater flexibility to stabilize both unemployment and inflation.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180824a.htm
2018-08-24,Monetary Policy in a Changing Economy,"When a central bank acts to stimulate the economy to bring down unemployment, inflation might push above the bank's inflation target.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180824a.htm
2018-08-24,Monetary Policy in a Changing Economy,"With expectations anchored, people expect the central bank to pursue policies that bring inflation back down, and longer-term inflation expectations do not rise.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180824a.htm
2018-08-24,Monetary Policy in a Changing Economy,"Thus, policy can be a bit more accommodative than if policymakers had to offset a rise in longer-term expectations.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180824a.htm
2018-08-24,Monetary Policy in a Changing Economy,"Shifting Stars and the ""New Economy"" of the Late 1990sThe second half of the 1990s confronted policymakers with a situation that was in some ways the flipside of that in the Great Inflation.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180824a.htm
2018-08-24,Monetary Policy in a Changing Economy,"In mid-1996, the unemployment rate was below the natural rate as perceived in real time, and many FOMC participants and others were forecasting growth above the economy's potential.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180824a.htm
2018-08-24,Monetary Policy in a Changing Economy,"Sentiment was building on the FOMC to raise the federal funds rate to head off the risk of rising inflation.9But Chairman Greenspan had a hunch that the United States was experiencing the wonders of a ""new economy"" in which improved productivity growth would allow faster output growth and lower unemployment, without serious inflation risks.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180824a.htm
2018-08-24,Monetary Policy in a Changing Economy,Greenspan argued that the FOMC should hold off on rate increases.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180824a.htm
2018-08-24,Monetary Policy in a Changing Economy,"Over the next two years, thanks to his considerable fortitude, Greenspan prevailed, and the FOMC raised the federal funds rate only once from mid-1996 through late 1998.10Starting in 1996, the economy boomed and the unemployment rate fell, but, contrary to conventional wisdom at the time, inflation fell.11",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180824a.htm
2018-08-24,Monetary Policy in a Changing Economy,"Once again, shifting stars help explain the performance of inflation, which many had seen as a puzzle.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180824a.htm
2018-08-24,Monetary Policy in a Changing Economy,"Whereas during the Great Inflation period the real-time natural rate of unemployment had been well below our current-day assessment, in the new-economy period, this relation was reversed (figure 3).",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180824a.htm
2018-08-24,Monetary Policy in a Changing Economy,"The labor market looked to be tight and getting tighter in real time, but in retrospect, we estimate that there was slack in the labor market in 1996 and early 1997, and the labor market only tightened appreciably through 1998 (figure 4).",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180824a.htm
2018-08-24,Monetary Policy in a Changing Economy,Greenspan was also right that the potential growth rate had shifted up.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180824a.htm
2018-08-24,Monetary Policy in a Changing Economy,"With hindsight, we recognize today that higher potential growth could accommodate the very strong growth that actually materialized, let alone the moderate growth policymakers were forecasting.12",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180824a.htm
2018-08-24,Monetary Policy in a Changing Economy,The FOMC thus avoided the Great-Inflation-era mistake of overemphasizing imprecise estimates of the stars.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180824a.htm
2018-08-24,Monetary Policy in a Changing Economy,"Under Chairman Greenspan's leadership, the Committee converged on a risk-management strategy that can be distilled into a simple request: Let's wait one more meeting; if there are clearer signs of inflation, we will commence tightening.13Meeting after meeting, the Committee held off on rate increases while believing that signs of rising inflation would soon appear.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180824a.htm
2018-08-24,Monetary Policy in a Changing Economy,"And meeting after meeting, inflation gradually declined.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180824a.htm
2018-08-24,Monetary Policy in a Changing Economy,"In retrospect, it may seem odd that it took great fortitude to defend ""let's wait one more meeting,"" given that inflation was low and falling.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180824a.htm
2018-08-24,Monetary Policy in a Changing Economy,"Conventional wisdom at the time, however, still urged policymakers to respond preemptively to inflation risk--even when that risk was gleaned mainly from hazy, real-time assessments of the stars.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180824a.htm
2018-08-24,Monetary Policy in a Changing Economy,"With the experience in the new-economy period, policymakers were beginning to appreciate that, with inflation expectations much better anchored than before, there was a smaller risk that an inflation uptick under Greenspan's ""wait and see"" approach would become a significant problem.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180824a.htm
2018-08-24,Monetary Policy in a Changing Economy,"Risk Management in the Face of Shifting StarsGiven what the economy has shown us over the past 15 years, the need for the sort of risk‑management approach that originated in the new-economy era is clearer than ever before.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180824a.htm
2018-08-24,Monetary Policy in a Changing Economy,That approach continues to evolve based on experience and the growing literature on monetary policy and structural uncertainty.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180824a.htm
2018-08-24,Monetary Policy in a Changing Economy,"Experience has revealed two realities about the relation between inflation and unemployment, and these bear directly on the two questions I started with.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180824a.htm
2018-08-24,Monetary Policy in a Changing Economy,"First, the stars are sometimes far from where we perceive them to be.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180824a.htm
2018-08-24,Monetary Policy in a Changing Economy,"In particular, we now know that the level of the unemployment rate relative to our real-time estimate of u* will sometimes be a misleading indicator of the state of the economy or of future inflation.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180824a.htm
2018-08-24,Monetary Policy in a Changing Economy,"Second, the reverse also seems to be true: Inflation may no longer be the first or best indicator of a tight labor market and rising pressures on resource utilization.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180824a.htm
2018-08-24,Monetary Policy in a Changing Economy,"Part of the reason inflation sends a weaker signal is undoubtedly the achievement of anchored inflation expectations and the related flattening of the Phillips curve.14Whatever the cause, in the run-up to the past two recessions, destabilizing excesses appeared mainly in financial markets rather than in inflation.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180824a.htm
2018-08-24,Monetary Policy in a Changing Economy,"Thus, risk management suggests looking beyond inflation for signs of excesses.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180824a.htm
2018-08-24,Monetary Policy in a Changing Economy,These two realities present challenges.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180824a.htm
2018-08-24,Monetary Policy in a Changing Economy,"The literature on uncertainty reviewed at the 2003 symposium--and much refined since then--provides important advice for how policy should respond, although not yet, in my view, an explicit recipe or rule that a prudent central bank should follow.15The literature on robust rules, such as so-called difference rules, for example, supports the idea of putting less emphasis on the level of unemployment relative to u*.16The FOMC's practice of looking at a broad range of indicators when assessing the state of the labor market has explicitly been part of the FOMC's Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy since its inception in 2012.17We have greatly expanded the scope of our surveillance for signs of labor market tightness and of destabilizing excesses more generally.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180824a.htm
2018-08-24,Monetary Policy in a Changing Economy,The risks from misperceiving the stars also now play a prominent role in the FOMC's deliberations.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180824a.htm
2018-08-24,Monetary Policy in a Changing Economy,A paper by Federal Reserve Board staff is a recent example of a range of research that helps FOMC participants visualize and manage these risks.18The research reports simulations of the economic outcomes that might result under various policy rules and policymaker misperceptions about the economy.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180824a.htm
2018-08-24,Monetary Policy in a Changing Economy,"One general finding is that no single, simple approach to monetary policy is likely to be appropriate across a broad range of plausible scenarios.19More concretely, simulations like these inform our risk management by assessing the likelihood that misperception would lead to adverse outcomes, such as inflation falling below zero or rising above 5 percent.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180824a.htm
2018-08-24,Monetary Policy in a Changing Economy,"Finally, the literature on structural uncertainty suggests some broader insights.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180824a.htm
2018-08-24,Monetary Policy in a Changing Economy,"This literature started with the work of William Brainard and the well-known Brainard principle, which recommends that when you are uncertain about the effects of your actions, you should move conservatively.20In other words, when unsure of the potency of a medicine, start with a somewhat smaller dose.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180824a.htm
2018-08-24,Monetary Policy in a Changing Economy,"As Brainard made clear, this is not a universal truth, and recent research highlights two particularly important cases in which doing too little comes with higher costs than doing too much.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180824a.htm
2018-08-24,Monetary Policy in a Changing Economy,"The first case is when attempting to avoid severely adverse events such as a financial crisis or an extended period with interest rates at the effective lower bound.21In such situations, the famous words ""We will do whatever it takes"" will likely be more effective than ""We will take cautious steps toward doing whatever it takes.""",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180824a.htm
2018-08-24,Monetary Policy in a Changing Economy,The second case is when inflation expectations threaten to become unanchored.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180824a.htm
2018-08-24,Monetary Policy in a Changing Economy,"If expectations were to begin to drift, the reality or expectation of a weak initial response could exacerbate the problem.22I am confident that the FOMC would resolutely ""do whatever it takes"" should inflation expectations drift materially up or down or should crisis again threaten.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180824a.htm
2018-08-24,Monetary Policy in a Changing Economy,"In addition, a decade of regulatory reforms and private-sector advances have greatly increased the strength and resilience of the financial system, with the aim of reducing the likelihood that the inevitable financial shocks will become crises.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180824a.htm
2018-08-24,Monetary Policy in a Changing Economy,"The Current SituationLet me conclude by returning to the matter of navigating between the two risks I identified--moving too fast and needlessly shortening the expansion, versus moving too slowly and risking a destabilizing overheating.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180824a.htm
2018-08-24,Monetary Policy in a Changing Economy,Readers of the minutes of FOMC meetings and other communications will know that our discussions focus keenly on the relative salience of these risks.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180824a.htm
2018-08-24,Monetary Policy in a Changing Economy,The diversity of views on the FOMC is one of the great virtues of our system.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180824a.htm
2018-08-24,Monetary Policy in a Changing Economy,"Despite differing views on these questions and others, we have a long institutional tradition of finding common ground in coalescing around a policy stance.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180824a.htm
2018-08-24,Monetary Policy in a Changing Economy,I see the current path of gradually raising interest rates as the FOMC's approach to taking seriously both of these risks.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180824a.htm
2018-08-24,Monetary Policy in a Changing Economy,"While the unemployment rate is below the Committee's estimate of the longer-run natural rate, estimates of this rate are quite uncertain.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180824a.htm
2018-08-24,Monetary Policy in a Changing Economy,The same is true of estimates of the neutral interest rate.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180824a.htm
2018-08-24,Monetary Policy in a Changing Economy,We therefore refer to many indicators when judging the degree of slack in the economy or the degree of accommodation in the current policy stance.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180824a.htm
2018-08-24,Monetary Policy in a Changing Economy,"We are also aware that, over time, inflation has become much less responsive to changes in resource utilization.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180824a.htm
2018-08-24,Monetary Policy in a Changing Economy,"While inflation has recently moved up near 2 percent, we have seen no clear sign of an acceleration above 2 percent, and there does not seem to be an elevated risk of overheating.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180824a.htm
2018-08-24,Monetary Policy in a Changing Economy,"This is good news, and we believe that this good news results in part from the ongoing normalization process, which has moved the stance of policy gradually closer to the FOMC's rough assessment of neutral as the expansion has continued.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180824a.htm
2018-08-24,Monetary Policy in a Changing Economy,"As the most recent FOMC statement indicates, if the strong growth in income and jobs continues, further gradual increases in the target range for the federal funds rate will likely be appropriate.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180824a.htm

2018-06-20,Monetary Policy at a Time of Uncertainty and Tight Labor Markets,"By some estimates, the natural rate of unemployment is substantially lower now.4For example, the Congressional Budget Office now estimates that the natural rate was about 5‑3/4 percent (and rising) in the late 1960s, compared with 4-3/4 percent at present.5",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180620a.htm
2018-06-20,Monetary Policy at a Time of Uncertainty and Tight Labor Markets,"Rising education levels do point to a decline in the natural rate since the 1960s, because more highly educated people are less likely to be unemployed.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180620a.htm
2018-06-20,Monetary Policy at a Time of Uncertainty and Tight Labor Markets,"The share of the population with a college degree has risen from less than 15 percent in the late 1960s to nearly 40 percent now, and the share with less than a high school degree has declined from 45 percent to about 5 percent.6Another important difference from the 1960s is that inflation has been low and stable for an extended period, which has better anchored inflation expectations.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180620a.htm
2018-06-20,Monetary Policy at a Time of Uncertainty and Tight Labor Markets,Today policymakers have a greater appreciation of the role expectations play in inflation dynamics and a clearer commitment to maintaining low and stable inflation.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180620a.htm
2018-06-20,Monetary Policy at a Time of Uncertainty and Tight Labor Markets,"Unfortunately, with the passage of a half-century and important changes in the structure of our economy and in central bank practices, in my view the historical comparison does not shed as much light as we might have hoped.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180620a.htm

2018-06-20,Monetary Policy at a Time of Uncertainty and Tight Labor Markets,"First, estimates of the natural rate of unemployment by Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) participants and others have drifted lower as unemployment has declined without much apparent reaction from inflation.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180620a.htm
2018-06-20,Monetary Policy at a Time of Uncertainty and Tight Labor Markets,How reliable are these estimates?,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180620a.htm
2018-06-20,Monetary Policy at a Time of Uncertainty and Tight Labor Markets,"Natural rate estimates have always been uncertain, and may be even more so now as inflation has become less responsive to the unemployment rate.7The anchoring of expectations is a welcome development and has likely played a role in flattening the Phillips curve.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180620a.htm
2018-06-20,Monetary Policy at a Time of Uncertainty and Tight Labor Markets,But a flatter Phillips curve makes it harder to assess whether movements in inflation reflect the cyclical position of the economy or other influences.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180620a.htm
2018-06-20,Monetary Policy at a Time of Uncertainty and Tight Labor Markets,"Second, what would be the consequences for inflation if unemployment were to run well below the natural rate for an extended period?",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180620a.htm
2018-06-20,Monetary Policy at a Time of Uncertainty and Tight Labor Markets,"The flat Phillips curve suggests that the implications for inflation might not be large, although a very tight labor market could lead to larger, nonlinear effects.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180620a.htm
2018-06-20,Monetary Policy at a Time of Uncertainty and Tight Labor Markets,"Research on this question is ambiguous, again reflecting the limited historical experience.8We should also remember that where inflation expectations are well anchored, it is likely because central banks have kept inflation under control.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180620a.htm
2018-06-20,Monetary Policy at a Time of Uncertainty and Tight Labor Markets,"If central banks were instead to try to exploit the nonresponsiveness of inflation to low unemployment and push resource utilization significantly and persistently past sustainable levels, the public might begin to question our commitment to low inflation, and expectations could come under upward pressure.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180620a.htm
2018-06-20,Monetary Policy at a Time of Uncertainty and Tight Labor Markets,"So far, we see no signs of this.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180620a.htm

2018-06-20,Monetary Policy at a Time of Uncertainty and Tight Labor Markets,"But we have often seen confidence become overconfidence and lead to excessive borrowing and risk-taking, leaving the financial system more vulnerable.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180620a.htm
2018-06-20,Monetary Policy at a Time of Uncertainty and Tight Labor Markets,"Indeed, the fact that the two most recent U.S. recessions stemmed principally from financial imbalances, not high inflation, highlights the importance of closely monitoring financial conditions.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180620a.htm
2018-06-20,Monetary Policy at a Time of Uncertainty and Tight Labor Markets,Today I see U.S. financial stability vulnerabilities as moderate and broadly in line with their long-run averages.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180620a.htm

2018-06-20,Monetary Policy at a Time of Uncertainty and Tight Labor Markets,"Fourth, while persistently strong economic conditions can pose risks to inflation and perhaps financial stability, we can also ask whether there may be lasting benefits.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180620a.htm
2018-06-20,Monetary Policy at a Time of Uncertainty and Tight Labor Markets,"As I mentioned, a tight labor market could draw more people into the labor force.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180620a.htm
2018-06-20,Monetary Policy at a Time of Uncertainty and Tight Labor Markets,"In fact, as the labor market has tightened, more workers have been moving back to work and off disability rolls.9There could also be benefits to productivity and potential growth.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180620a.htm
2018-06-20,Monetary Policy at a Time of Uncertainty and Tight Labor Markets,"All told, though, the persistence of any such ""positive hysteresis"" benefits is uncertain, since, again, the historical evidence is sparse and inconclusive.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180620a.htm
2018-06-20,Monetary Policy at a Time of Uncertainty and Tight Labor Markets,"As is often the case, in the current environment, significant uncertainty attends the process of making monetary policy.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180620a.htm

2018-05-25,Financial Stability and Central Bank Transparency,Financial stability policymaking has evolved from managing individual crises as they arise to establishing a policy framework that emphasizes prevention.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180525a.htm
2018-05-25,Financial Stability and Central Bank Transparency,"This framework now includes measures to increase the resiliency of the financial system; enhanced monitoring of financial institutions and of building risks to the system; and measures, such as resolution planning, that require firms to take steps today to better prepare for future episodes of stress.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180525a.htm

2018-05-25,Financial Stability and Central Bank Transparency,"While the focus is often on monetary policy independence, research suggests that a degree of independence in regulatory and financial stability matters improves the stability of the banking system and leads to better outcomes.3For this reason, governments in many countries, including the United States, have granted some institutional and budgetary independence to their financial regulators.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180525a.htm

2018-05-25,Financial Stability and Central Bank Transparency,"In turn, transparency provides an essential basis for accountability and democratic legitimacy by enabling effective legislative oversight and keeping the public informed.4Of course, central banks also need to stick closely to our mandates; the case for independence weakens to the extent that central banks stray into issues that the legislature has not assigned to us.5",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180525a.htm

2018-05-25,Financial Stability and Central Bank Transparency,"In the financial stability arena, there is no better example of this than the role that the first round of stress tests played during the crisis in restoring confidence in the U.S. banking system.6So in the financial stability realm, the case for enhanced transparency is not just about being accountable; it is also about providing credible information that can help restore and sustain public confidence in the financial system.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180525a.htm

2018-05-25,Financial Stability and Central Bank Transparency,"The post-crisis regime has shifted to implementing preventive policies well in advance of any crisis.7Newly established ex ante policies include building the resilience of institutions by requiring more and higher-quality capital and liquidity buffers; a regime of stress tests undertaken by supervisors; and resolution planning, which requires firms to analyze their own potential for distress or failure and create a plan to be used in the event of bankruptcy.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180525a.htm

2018-05-08,Monetary Policy Influences on Global Financial Conditions and International Capital Flows,Thank you for inviting me to join you today as part of this distinguished panel.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180508a.htm
2018-05-08,Monetary Policy Influences on Global Financial Conditions and International Capital Flows,"Our subject is the relationship between ""center country"" monetary policy and global financial conditions, and the policy implications of that relationship both for the center country and for other countries affected.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180508a.htm
2018-05-08,Monetary Policy Influences on Global Financial Conditions and International Capital Flows,This broad topic has been the subject of a great deal of research and discussion in recent years.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180508a.htm
2018-05-08,Monetary Policy Influences on Global Financial Conditions and International Capital Flows,Today I will focus in particular on the role of U.S. monetary policy in driving global financial conditions and capital flows.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180508a.htm
2018-05-08,Monetary Policy Influences on Global Financial Conditions and International Capital Flows,"To preview my conclusions, I will argue that, while global factors play an important role in influencing domestic financial conditions, the role of U.S. monetary policy is often exaggerated.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180508a.htm
2018-05-08,Monetary Policy Influences on Global Financial Conditions and International Capital Flows,"And while financial globalization does pose some challenges for monetary policy, efforts to build stronger and more transparent policy frameworks and a more resilient financial system can reduce the adverse consequences of external shocks.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180508a.htm
2018-05-08,Monetary Policy Influences on Global Financial Conditions and International Capital Flows,"The well-known Mundell-Fleming ""trilemma"" states that it is not possible to have all three of the following things: free capital mobility, a fixed exchange rate, and the ability to pursue an independent monetary policy.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180508a.htm
2018-05-08,Monetary Policy Influences on Global Financial Conditions and International Capital Flows,"The trilemma does not say that a flexible exchange rate will always fully insulate domestic economic conditions from external shocks.1And, indeed, that is not the case.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180508a.htm
2018-05-08,Monetary Policy Influences on Global Financial Conditions and International Capital Flows,"We have seen that integration of global capital markets can make for difficult tradeoffs for some economies, whether they have fixed or floating exchange rate regimes.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180508a.htm
2018-05-08,Monetary Policy Influences on Global Financial Conditions and International Capital Flows,"Since the Fed is the central bank of the world's largest economy and issuer of the world's most widely used reserve currency, it is to be expected that the Fed's policy actions will spill over to other economies.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180508a.htm
2018-05-08,Monetary Policy Influences on Global Financial Conditions and International Capital Flows,"To illustrate this point, the scatterplot on the left side offigure 1focuses on movements in interest rates and exchange rates following Federal Reserve policy announcements.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180508a.htm
2018-05-08,Monetary Policy Influences on Global Financial Conditions and International Capital Flows,"As you can see, changes in U.S. interest rates after Fed policy actions (shown on the horizontal axis) lead to corresponding changes in the value of the dollar (shown on the vertical axis).",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180508a.htm
2018-05-08,Monetary Policy Influences on Global Financial Conditions and International Capital Flows,"And because of the dollar's widespread use around the world, these changes in the dollar affect financial conditions abroad.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180508a.htm
2018-05-08,Monetary Policy Influences on Global Financial Conditions and International Capital Flows,"Fed policy-related movements in U.S. bond yields also tend to spill over to bond yields abroad, such as the German yields shown in the scatterplot on the right.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180508a.htm
2018-05-08,Monetary Policy Influences on Global Financial Conditions and International Capital Flows,"Such spillovers are to be expected in a world of highly integrated financial markets.2Asfigure 2shows, bond yields (left) and equity prices (right) around the world typically move together fairly closely.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180508a.htm
2018-05-08,Monetary Policy Influences on Global Financial Conditions and International Capital Flows,But the influence of U.S. monetary policy on global financial conditions should not be overstated.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180508a.htm
2018-05-08,Monetary Policy Influences on Global Financial Conditions and International Capital Flows,The Federal Reserve is not the only central bank whose actions affect global financial markets.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180508a.htm
2018-05-08,Monetary Policy Influences on Global Financial Conditions and International Capital Flows,"In fact, the United States is the recipient as well as the originator of monetary policy spillovers.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180508a.htm
2018-05-08,Monetary Policy Influences on Global Financial Conditions and International Capital Flows,"For example, as seen infigure 3, changes in German yields after European Central Bank policy decisions also pass through to U.S. yields.3More broadly, it is notable that although the Fed has raised its target interest rate six times since December 2015 and has begun to shrink its balance sheet, overall U.S. domestic financial conditions have gotten looser, in part due to improving global conditions and central bank policy abroad.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180508a.htm
2018-05-08,Monetary Policy Influences on Global Financial Conditions and International Capital Flows,Much of the discussion of the spillovers of U.S. monetary policy focuses on their effects on financial conditions in emerging market economies (EMEs).,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180508a.htm
2018-05-08,Monetary Policy Influences on Global Financial Conditions and International Capital Flows,Some observers have attributed the movements in international capital flowing to EMEs since the Global Financial Crisis primarily to monetary stimulus by the Fed and other advanced-economy central banks.4The data do not seem to me to fit this narrative particularly well.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180508a.htm
2018-05-08,Monetary Policy Influences on Global Financial Conditions and International Capital Flows,"As illustrated by the blue dashed line in the left panel offigure 4, capital flows to EMEs were already very strong before the Global Financial Crisis, when the federal funds rate was comparatively high.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180508a.htm
2018-05-08,Monetary Policy Influences on Global Financial Conditions and International Capital Flows,"The subsequent surge in capital flows in 2009, as the crisis was abating, largely reflects a rebound from the capital flow interruption during the crisis itself, though highly accommodative monetary policies in advanced economies doubtless also played a role.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180508a.htm
2018-05-08,Monetary Policy Influences on Global Financial Conditions and International Capital Flows,"Moreover, capital flows to EMEs started to ease after 2011, a period when the Federal Reserve continued to add accommodation and reduce yields through increases in its balance sheet, as shown in the right panel.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180508a.htm
2018-05-08,Monetary Policy Influences on Global Financial Conditions and International Capital Flows,"And, more recently, capital flows to EMEs have picked up again despite the fact that the Fed has been removing accommodation since 2015.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180508a.htm
2018-05-08,Monetary Policy Influences on Global Financial Conditions and International Capital Flows,"If U.S. monetary policy is not the major determinant, what other factors have been driving EME capital flows?",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180508a.htm
2018-05-08,Monetary Policy Influences on Global Financial Conditions and International Capital Flows,One prominent factor has been growth differentials between EMEs and advanced economies.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180508a.htm
2018-05-08,Monetary Policy Influences on Global Financial Conditions and International Capital Flows,"Infigure 5, the left panel shows that capital inflows to EMEs picked up post-crisis, in line with the widening of this growth differential, while the slowdown in inflows after 2011 coincides with its narrowing.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180508a.htm
2018-05-08,Monetary Policy Influences on Global Financial Conditions and International Capital Flows,"Another related determinant has been commodity prices, as shown in the right panel.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180508a.htm
2018-05-08,Monetary Policy Influences on Global Financial Conditions and International Capital Flows,The pickup in both global growth and commodity prices over the past couple of years explains a good part of the recent recovery of capital flows to EMEs.5,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180508a.htm
2018-05-08,Monetary Policy Influences on Global Financial Conditions and International Capital Flows,Monetary stimulus by the Fed and other advanced-economy central banks played a relatively limited role in the surge of capital flows to EMEs in recent years.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180508a.htm
2018-05-08,Monetary Policy Influences on Global Financial Conditions and International Capital Flows,There is good reason to think that the normalization of monetary policies in advanced economies should continue to prove manageable for EMEs.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180508a.htm
2018-05-08,Monetary Policy Influences on Global Financial Conditions and International Capital Flows,"Fed policy normalization has proceeded without disruption to financial markets, and market participants' expectations for policy (the red symbols infigure 6) seem reasonably well aligned with policymakers' expectations in the Summary of Economic Projections (the black dots), suggesting that markets should not be surprised by our actions if the economy evolves in line with expectations.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180508a.htm
2018-05-08,Monetary Policy Influences on Global Financial Conditions and International Capital Flows,It also bears emphasizing that the EMEs themselves have made considerable progress in reducing vulnerabilities since the crisis-prone 1980s and 1990s.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180508a.htm
2018-05-08,Monetary Policy Influences on Global Financial Conditions and International Capital Flows,"Many EMEs have substantially improved their fiscal and monetary policy frameworks while adopting more flexible exchange rates, a policy that recent research shows provides better insulation from external financial shocks.6Corporate debt at risk--the debt of firms with limited debt service capacity--has been rising in EMEs, as shown infigure 7.7But this rise has been relatively limited outside of China and has begun to reverse as stronger global growth has pushed up earnings.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180508a.htm
2018-05-08,Monetary Policy Influences on Global Financial Conditions and International Capital Flows,"All that said, I do not dismiss the prospective risks emanating from global policy normalization.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180508a.htm
2018-05-08,Monetary Policy Influences on Global Financial Conditions and International Capital Flows,"Some investors and institutions may not be well positioned for a rise in interest rates, even one that markets broadly anticipate.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180508a.htm
2018-05-08,Monetary Policy Influences on Global Financial Conditions and International Capital Flows,"And, of course, future economic conditions may surprise us, as they often do.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180508a.htm

2018-05-08,Monetary Policy Influences on Global Financial Conditions and International Capital Flows,"Some observers have argued that U.S. monetary policy also influences capital flows through its effects on global risk sentiment, with looser policy leading to more positive sentiment in markets and tighter policy depressing sentiment.8While those channels may well operate, research at both the Fed and the IMF suggests that actions by major central banks account for only a relatively small fraction of global financial volatility and capital flow movements.9",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180508a.htm

2018-04-06,The Outlook for the U.S. Economy,"In the long run, the level of maximum employment is not determined by monetary policy, but rather by factors affecting the structure and dynamics of the labor market.1Also, the level of maximum employment is not directly measureable, and it changes over time.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180406a.htm

2018-04-06,The Outlook for the U.S. Economy,"For example, to be counted in the official measure as unemployed, a person must have actively looked for a job in the past four weeks.3People who have not looked for work as recently are counted not as unemployed, but as out of the labor force, even though some of them actually want a job and are available to work.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180406a.htm

2018-04-06,The Outlook for the U.S. Economy,"So, in judging tightness in the labor market, we also look at a range of other statistics, including alternative measures of unemployment, as well as measures of vacancies and job flows, surveys of households' and businesses' perceptions of the job market, and, of course, data on wages and prices.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180406a.htm
2018-04-06,The Outlook for the U.S. Economy,"Figure 3shows the headline unemployment rate and two broader measures of unemployment, known as U-5 and U-6.4U-5 includes the unemployed plus people who say they want a job and have looked for one in the past year (though not in the past four weeks).",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180406a.htm
2018-04-06,The Outlook for the U.S. Economy,U-6 includes all those counted in U-5 plus people who are working part time but would like full-time work.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180406a.htm

2018-04-06,The Outlook for the U.S. Economy,The left panel of the next chart shows that employers are having about as much difficulty now attracting qualified workers as they did 20 years ago (figure 4).,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180406a.htm
2018-04-06,The Outlook for the U.S. Economy,"Likewise, the job vacancy rate, shown on the right, is close to its all-time high, as is the average number of weeks it takes to fill a job opening.5Households also are increasingly reporting that jobs are plentiful (figure 5), which is consistent with the high level of job postings reported by firms.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180406a.htm
2018-04-06,The Outlook for the U.S. Economy,"In addition, the proportion of workers quitting their jobs is high, suggesting that workers are being hired away from their current employers and that others are confident enough about their prospects to leave jobs voluntarily--even before they have landed their next job.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180406a.htm
2018-04-06,The Outlook for the U.S. Economy,"While the data I have discussed thus far do point to a tight labor market, other data are less definitive.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180406a.htm
2018-04-06,The Outlook for the U.S. Economy,"The labor force participation rate, which measures the percentage of working age individuals who are either working or actively looking for a job, has remained steady for about four years (figure 6).",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180406a.htm
2018-04-06,The Outlook for the U.S. Economy,"This flat performance is actually a sign of improvement, since increased retirements as our population ages have been putting downward pressure on participation and will continue to do so.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180406a.htm
2018-04-06,The Outlook for the U.S. Economy,"However, the participation rate of prime-age workers (those between the ages of 25 and 54) has not recovered fully to its pre-recession level, suggesting that there might still be room to pull more people into the labor force (figure 7).",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180406a.htm
2018-04-06,The Outlook for the U.S. Economy,"Indeed, the strong job market does appear to be drawing back some people who have been out of the labor force for a significant time.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180406a.htm
2018-04-06,The Outlook for the U.S. Economy,"For example, the percentage of adults returning to the labor force after previously reporting that they were not working because of a disability has increased over the past couple of years, and anecdotal reports indicate that employers are increasingly willing to take on and train workers they would not have considered in the past.6",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180406a.htm
2018-04-06,The Outlook for the U.S. Economy,"Wage growth has also remained moderate, though it has picked up compared with its pace in the early part of this recovery (figure 8).",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180406a.htm
2018-04-06,The Outlook for the U.S. Economy,Weak productivity growth is an important reason why we have not seen larger wage gains in recent years.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180406a.htm
2018-04-06,The Outlook for the U.S. Economy,"At the same time, the absence of a sharper acceleration in wages suggests that the labor market is not excessively tight.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180406a.htm
2018-04-06,The Outlook for the U.S. Economy,I will be looking for an additional pickup in wage growth as the labor market strengthens further.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180406a.htm
2018-04-06,The Outlook for the U.S. Economy,"Taking all of these measures of labor utilization on board, what can we say about the state of the labor market relative to our statutory goal of maximum employment?",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180406a.htm
2018-04-06,The Outlook for the U.S. Economy,"While uncertainty around the long run level of these indicators is substantial, many of them suggest a labor market that is in the neighborhood of maximum employment.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180406a.htm
2018-04-06,The Outlook for the U.S. Economy,A few other measures continue to suggest some remaining slack.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180406a.htm
2018-04-06,The Outlook for the U.S. Economy,"Assessments of the maximum level of employment are uncertain, however, and subject to revision.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180406a.htm
2018-04-06,The Outlook for the U.S. Economy,"As we seek the highest sustainable utilization of labor resources, the Committee will be guided by incoming data across all of these measures.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180406a.htm
2018-04-06,The Outlook for the U.S. Economy,InflationThat brings me to inflation--the other leg of our dual mandate.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180406a.htm
2018-04-06,The Outlook for the U.S. Economy,The substantial improvement in the labor market has been accompanied by low inflation.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180406a.htm
2018-04-06,The Outlook for the U.S. Economy,"Indeed, inflation has continued to run below our 2 percent longer-run objective (figure 9).",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180406a.htm
2018-04-06,The Outlook for the U.S. Economy,"Consumer prices, as measured by the price index for personal consumption expenditures, increased 1.8 percent over the 12 months ending in February.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180406a.htm
2018-04-06,The Outlook for the U.S. Economy,"The core price index, which excludes the prices of energy and food and is typically a better indicator of future inflation, rose 1.6 percent over the same period.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180406a.htm
2018-04-06,The Outlook for the U.S. Economy,"In fact, both of these indexes have been below 2 percent consistently for the past half-dozen years.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180406a.htm
2018-04-06,The Outlook for the U.S. Economy,"This persistent shortfall in inflation from our target has led some to question the traditional relationship between inflation and the unemployment rate, also known as the Phillips curve.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180406a.htm
2018-04-06,The Outlook for the U.S. Economy,"Given how low the unemployment rate is, why aren't we seeing higher inflation now?",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180406a.htm
2018-04-06,The Outlook for the U.S. Economy,As those of you who carefully read the minutes of each FOMC meeting are aware--and I know there are some of you out there--we had a thorough discussion of inflation dynamics at our January meeting.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180406a.htm
2018-04-06,The Outlook for the U.S. Economy,Almost all of the participants in that discussion thought that the Phillips curve remained a useful basis for understanding inflation.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180406a.htm
2018-04-06,The Outlook for the U.S. Economy,"They also acknowledged, however, that the link between labor market tightness and changes in inflation has become weaker and more difficult to estimate, reflecting in part the extended period of low and stable inflation in the United States and in other advanced economies.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180406a.htm
2018-04-06,The Outlook for the U.S. Economy,"Participants also noted that other factors, including inflation expectations and transitory changes in energy and import prices, can affect inflation.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180406a.htm
2018-04-06,The Outlook for the U.S. Economy,My view is that the data continue to show a relationship between the overall state of the labor market and the change in inflation over time.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180406a.htm
2018-04-06,The Outlook for the U.S. Economy,"That connection has weakened over the past couple of decades, but it still persists, and I believe it continues to be meaningful for monetary policy.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180406a.htm
2018-04-06,The Outlook for the U.S. Economy,Much of the shortfall in inflation in recent years is well explained by high unemployment during the early years of the recovery and by falling energy prices and the rise in the dollar in 2015 and 2016.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180406a.htm
2018-04-06,The Outlook for the U.S. Economy,"But the decline in inflation last year, as labor market conditions improved significantly, was a bit of a surprise.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180406a.htm
2018-04-06,The Outlook for the U.S. Economy,"The 2017 shortfall from our 2 percent goal appears to reflect, at least partly, some unusual price declines, such as for mobile phone plans, that occurred nearly a year ago.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180406a.htm
2018-04-06,The Outlook for the U.S. Economy,"In fact, monthly inflation readings have been firmer over the past several months, and the 12-month change should move up notably this spring as last spring's soft readings drop out of the 12-month calculation.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180406a.htm
2018-04-06,The Outlook for the U.S. Economy,"Consistent with this view, the median of FOMC participants' projections in our March survey shows inflation moving up to 1.9 percent this year and to 2 percent in 2019.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180406a.htm
2018-04-06,The Outlook for the U.S. Economy,"Longer-Run ChallengesAlthough job creation is strong and unemployment is low, the U.S. economy continues to face some important longer-run challenges.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180406a.htm
2018-04-06,The Outlook for the U.S. Economy,"GDP growth has averaged just over 2 percent per year in the current economic expansion, much slower than in previous expansions.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180406a.htm
2018-04-06,The Outlook for the U.S. Economy,Even the higher growth seen in recent quarters remains below the trend before the crisis.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180406a.htm
2018-04-06,The Outlook for the U.S. Economy,"Nonetheless, the unemployment rate has come down 6 percentage points during the current expansion, suggesting that the trend growth necessary to keep the unemployment rate unchanged has shifted down materially.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180406a.htm
2018-04-06,The Outlook for the U.S. Economy,The median of FOMC participants' projections of this longer-run trend growth rate is 1.8 percent.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180406a.htm
2018-04-06,The Outlook for the U.S. Economy,The latest estimate from the Blue-Chip consensus of private forecasters is about 2 percent.7,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180406a.htm
2018-04-06,The Outlook for the U.S. Economy,"To unpack this discussion a little further, we can think of output growth as composed of increases in hours worked and in output per hour, also known as productivity growth.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180406a.htm
2018-04-06,The Outlook for the U.S. Economy,"Here, a comparison with the 2001-to-2007 expansion is informative.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180406a.htm
2018-04-06,The Outlook for the U.S. Economy,"Output growth in that earlier expansion averaged nearly 3 percent per year, well above the pace in the current expansion.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180406a.htm
2018-04-06,The Outlook for the U.S. Economy,"Despite the faster output growth, however, average job growth in the early 2000s was 1/2 percentage point per year weaker than in the current expansion.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180406a.htm
2018-04-06,The Outlook for the U.S. Economy,"The difference, of course, is productivity, which grew at more than twice the pace in the early 2000s than it has in recent years.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180406a.htm
2018-04-06,The Outlook for the U.S. Economy,"Taking a longer view, the average pace of labor productivity growth since 2010 is the slowest since World War II and about one-fourth of the average postwar rate (figure 10).",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180406a.htm
2018-04-06,The Outlook for the U.S. Economy,"Moreover, the productivity growth slowdown seems to be global and is evident even in countries that were little affected by the financial crisis (figure 11).",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180406a.htm
2018-04-06,The Outlook for the U.S. Economy,This observation suggests that factors specific to the United States are probably not the main drivers.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180406a.htm
2018-04-06,The Outlook for the U.S. Economy,"As shown infigure 12, labor productivity growth can be broken down into the contributions from business investment (or capital deepening), changes in the skills and work experience of the workforce, and a residual component that is attributed to other factors such as technological change and efficiency gains (usually lumped together under the term total factor or multifactor productivity).",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180406a.htm
2018-04-06,The Outlook for the U.S. Economy,"In the United States and in many other countries, some of the slowdown in labor productivity growth can be traced to weak investment after the crisis.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180406a.htm
2018-04-06,The Outlook for the U.S. Economy,"Investment has picked up recently in the United States, however, which suggests that capital deepening may pick up as well.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180406a.htm
2018-04-06,The Outlook for the U.S. Economy,The other big contributor to the slowdown has been in total factor productivity growth.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180406a.htm
2018-04-06,The Outlook for the U.S. Economy,The outlook for this dimension of productivity is considerably more uncertain.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180406a.htm
2018-04-06,The Outlook for the U.S. Economy,"Total factor productivity growth is notoriously difficult to predict, and there are sharply different views on where it might be heading.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180406a.htm
2018-04-06,The Outlook for the U.S. Economy,"Some argue that the productivity gains from the information technology revolution are largely behind us, and that more-recent technological innovations have less potential to boost productivity.8Others argue that a well-documented decline in measures of business dynamism--such as the number of start-ups, the closure of less-productive businesses, and the rates at which workers quit their jobs and move around the country to take a new job--has held back productivity growth, in part by slowing the movement of capital and labor toward their most productive uses.9",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180406a.htm
2018-04-06,The Outlook for the U.S. Economy,"New technological breakthroughs in many areas--robotics, biotech, and artificial intelligence to name just a few--have led others to take a more optimistic view.10They point to substantial productivity gains from innovation in areas such as energy production and e-commerce.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180406a.htm
2018-04-06,The Outlook for the U.S. Economy,"In addition, the optimists point out that advances in technology often take decades to work their way into the economy before their ultimate effects on productivity are felt.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180406a.htm
2018-04-06,The Outlook for the U.S. Economy,"That delay has been observed even for game-changing innovations like the steam engine and electrification, which ultimately produced broad increases in productivity and living standards.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180406a.htm
2018-04-06,The Outlook for the U.S. Economy,"In this view, we just need to be patient for new technologies to diffuse through the economy.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180406a.htm
2018-04-06,The Outlook for the U.S. Economy,Only time will tell who has the better view‑‑the record provides little basis to believe that we can accurately forecast the rate of increase in productivity.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180406a.htm
2018-04-06,The Outlook for the U.S. Economy,The other principal contributor to output growth is hours worked.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180406a.htm
2018-04-06,The Outlook for the U.S. Economy,"Hours growth, in turn, is largely determined by growth in the labor force, which has averaged just 1/2 percent per year since 2010, well below the average in previous decades (figure 13).",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180406a.htm
2018-04-06,The Outlook for the U.S. Economy,"One reason for slower growth of the labor force is that baby boomers are aging and retiring, and that trend will continue.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180406a.htm
2018-04-06,The Outlook for the U.S. Economy,But another reason is that labor force participation of people between the ages of 25 and 54--prime-age individuals--declined from 2010 to 2015 and remains low.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180406a.htm
2018-04-06,The Outlook for the U.S. Economy,"Indeed, the participation rate for prime-age men has been falling for more than 50 years, while women's participation in this age group rose through the 1990s but then turned downward, and it has fallen for the past 20 years.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180406a.htm
2018-04-06,The Outlook for the U.S. Economy,These trends in participation have been more pronounced in the United States than in other advanced economies.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180406a.htm
2018-04-06,The Outlook for the U.S. Economy,"In 1990, the United States had relatively high participation rates for prime-age women relative to other countries and was in the midrange of advanced economies for prime-age men.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180406a.htm
2018-04-06,The Outlook for the U.S. Economy,"However, we now stand at the low end of participation for both men and women in this age group--just above Italy, but well below Germany, France, and Spain (figure 14).",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180406a.htm
2018-04-06,The Outlook for the U.S. Economy,"There is no consensus about the reasons for the long-term decline in prime-age participation rates, and a variety of factors could have played a role.11For example, while automation and globalization have contributed positively to overall domestic production and growth, adjustment to these developments has resulted in dislocations of many workers without college degrees and those employed in manufacturing.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180406a.htm
2018-04-06,The Outlook for the U.S. Economy,"In addition, factors such as the increase in disability rolls in recent decades and the opioid crisis may have reduced the supply of prime-age workers.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180406a.htm
2018-04-06,The Outlook for the U.S. Economy,"Given that the declines have been larger here than in other countries, it seems likely that factors specific to the United States have played an important role.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180406a.htm
2018-04-06,The Outlook for the U.S. Economy,"As I noted earlier, the strong economy may continue to pull some prime-age individuals back into the labor force and encourage others not to drop out.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180406a.htm
2018-04-06,The Outlook for the U.S. Economy,"Research suggests that structurally-oriented measures--for example, improving education or fighting the opioid crisis--also will help raise labor force participation in this age group.12",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180406a.htm
2018-04-06,The Outlook for the U.S. Economy,"To summarize this discussion, some of the factors weighing on longer-term growth are likely to be persistent, particularly the slowing in growth of the workforce.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180406a.htm
2018-04-06,The Outlook for the U.S. Economy,"Others are hard to predict, such as productivity.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180406a.htm
2018-04-06,The Outlook for the U.S. Economy,"But as a nation, we are not bystanders.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180406a.htm
2018-04-06,The Outlook for the U.S. Economy,"We can put policies in place that will support labor force participation and give us the best chance to achieve broad and sustained increases in productivity, and thus in living standards.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180406a.htm
2018-04-06,The Outlook for the U.S. Economy,"These policies are mostly outside the toolkit of the Federal Reserve, such as those that support investment in education and workers' skills, business investment and research and development, and investment in infrastructure.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180406a.htm
2018-04-06,The Outlook for the U.S. Economy,Monetary PolicyLet me turn now to monetary policy.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180406a.htm
2018-04-06,The Outlook for the U.S. Economy,"In the aftermath of the financial crisis, the FOMC went to extraordinary lengths to promote the recovery, support job growth, and prevent inflation from falling too low.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180406a.htm
2018-04-06,The Outlook for the U.S. Economy,"As the recovery advanced, it became appropriate to begin reducing monetary policy support.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180406a.htm
2018-04-06,The Outlook for the U.S. Economy,"Since monetary policy affects the economy with a lag, waiting until inflation and employment hit our goals before reducing policy support could have led to a rise in inflation to unwelcome levels.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180406a.htm
2018-04-06,The Outlook for the U.S. Economy,"In such circumstances, monetary policy might need to tighten abruptly, which could disrupt the economy or even trigger a recession.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180406a.htm
2018-04-06,The Outlook for the U.S. Economy,"As a result, to sustain the expansion, the FOMC adopted a gradual approach to reducing monetary policy support.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180406a.htm
2018-04-06,The Outlook for the U.S. Economy,We began in December 2015 by raising our target for the federal funds rate for the first time in nearly a decade.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180406a.htm
2018-04-06,The Outlook for the U.S. Economy,"Since then, with the economy improving but inflation still below target and some slack remaining, the Committee has continued to gradually raise interest rates.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180406a.htm
2018-04-06,The Outlook for the U.S. Economy,This patient approach also reduced the risk that an unforeseen blow to the economy might push the federal funds rate back near zero‑‑its effective lower bound--thus limiting our ability to provide appropriate monetary accommodation.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180406a.htm
2018-04-06,The Outlook for the U.S. Economy,"In addition, after careful planning and public communication, last October the FOMC began to gradually and predictably reduce the size of the Fed's balance sheet.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180406a.htm
2018-04-06,The Outlook for the U.S. Economy,Reducing our securities holdings is another way to move the stance of monetary policy toward neutral.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180406a.htm
2018-04-06,The Outlook for the U.S. Economy,The balance sheet reduction process is going smoothly and is expected to contribute over time to a gradual tightening of financial conditions.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180406a.htm
2018-04-06,The Outlook for the U.S. Economy,"Over the next few years, the size of our balance sheet is expected to shrink significantly.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180406a.htm

2019-11-25,Building on the Gains from the Long Expansion,These themes show through in many ways in official statistics.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20191125a.htm
2019-11-25,Building on the Gains from the Long Expansion,"For example, more than a decade of steady advances has pushed the jobless rate near a 50-year low, where it has remained for well over a year.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20191125a.htm
2019-11-25,Building on the Gains from the Long Expansion,"But the wealth of middle-income families—savings, home equity, and other assets—has only recently surpassed levels seen before the Great Recession, and the wealth of people with lower incomes, while growing, has yet to fully recover.1",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20191125a.htm

2019-11-25,Building on the Gains from the Long Expansion,Then I will turn to two important opportunities for further gains from this expansion: maintaining a stable and reliable pace of 2 percent inflation and spreading the benefits of employment more widely.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20191125a.htm
2019-11-25,Building on the Gains from the Long Expansion,"Monetary Policy and the Economy in 2019We started 2019 with a favorable outlook, and over the year the outlook has changed only modestly in the eyes of many forecasters (figure 1).",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20191125a.htm
2019-11-25,Building on the Gains from the Long Expansion,"For example, in the Survey of Professional Forecasters, the forecast for inflation is a bit lower, but the unemployment forecast is unchanged and the forecast for gross domestic product (GDP) is nearly unchanged.2The key to the ongoing favorable outlook is household spending, which represents about 70 percent of the economy and continues to be strong, supported by the healthy job market, rising incomes, and solid consumer confidence.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20191125a.htm

2019-11-25,Building on the Gains from the Long Expansion,Some of the softness in overall inflation is the result of a fall in oil prices and should not affect inflation going forward.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20191125a.htm

2019-11-25,Building on the Gains from the Long Expansion,"In doing so, we often refer to certain benchmarks.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20191125a.htm
2019-11-25,Building on the Gains from the Long Expansion,One of these is the interest rate that would be neutral—neither restraining the economy nor pushing it upward.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20191125a.htm
2019-11-25,Building on the Gains from the Long Expansion,"We call that rate ""r*"" (pronounced ""r star"").",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20191125a.htm

2019-11-25,Building on the Gains from the Long Expansion,"A second benchmark is the natural rate of unemployment, which is the lowest rate of unemployment that would not create upward pressure on inflation.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20191125a.htm
2019-11-25,Building on the Gains from the Long Expansion,"We call that rate ""u*"" (pronounced ""u star"").",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20191125a.htm

2019-11-25,Building on the Gains from the Long Expansion,"Since the end of last year, incoming data—especially muted inflation data—prompted analysts inside and outside the Fed to again revise down their estimates of r* and u*.4Taken at face value, a lower r* would suggest that monetary policy is providing somewhat less support for employment and inflation than previously believed, and the fall in u* would suggest that the labor market was less tight than believed.5Both could help explain the weakness in inflation.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20191125a.htm
2019-11-25,Building on the Gains from the Long Expansion,"As with the revised jobs data, these revised estimates of the stars were not a game changer for policy, but they provided another reason why a somewhat lower setting of our policy interest rate might be appropriate.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20191125a.htm
2019-11-25,Building on the Gains from the Long Expansion,How did we add up all of these considerations?,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20191125a.htm

2019-11-25,Building on the Gains from the Long Expansion,"The full effects of these monetary policy actions will be felt over time, but we believe they are already helping to support consumer and business sentiment and boosting spending in interest-sensitive sectors, such as housing and consumer durable goods.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20191125a.htm
2019-11-25,Building on the Gains from the Long Expansion,"We see the current stance of monetary policy as likely to remain appropriate as long as incoming information about the economy remains broadly consistent with our outlook of moderate economic growth, a strong labor market, and inflation near our symmetric 2 percent objective.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20191125a.htm

2019-10-08,Data-Dependent Monetary Policy in an Evolving Economy,"Since then, remarkable advances in the technology for finding and extracting oil have led to a rapid increase in production to levels higher than ever before.3In 2018, the United States became the world's largest oil producer.4Oil exports have surged, imports have fallen (figure 2), and the U.S. Energy Information Administration projects that this month, for the first time in many decades, the United States will be a net exporter of oil.5",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20191008a.htm
2019-10-08,Data-Dependent Monetary Policy in an Evolving Economy,"As monetary policymakers, we closely monitor developments in oil markets because disruptions in these markets have played a role in several U.S. recessions and in the Great Inflation of the 1960s and 1970s.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20191008a.htm

2019-10-08,Data-Dependent Monetary Policy in an Evolving Economy,"Today a higher oil price would still cause dislocations and hardship for many, but with exports and imports nearly balanced, the higher price paid by consumers is roughly offset by higher earnings of workers and firms in the U.S. oil industry.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20191008a.htm
2019-10-08,Data-Dependent Monetary Policy in an Evolving Economy,"Moreover, because it is now easier to ramp up oil production, a sustained price rise can quickly boost output, providing a shock absorber in the face of supply disruptions.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20191008a.htm

2019-10-08,Data-Dependent Monetary Policy in an Evolving Economy,"Official statistics currently show productivity growth slowing significantly in recent years, with the growth in output per hour worked falling from more than 3 percent a year from 1995 to 2003 to less than half that pace since then.9Analysts are actively debating three alternative explanations for this apparent slowdown: First, the slowdown may be real and may persist indefinitely as productivity growth returns to more‑normal levels after a brief golden age.10Second, the slowdown may instead be a pause of the sort that often accompanies fundamental technological change, so that productivity gains from recent technology advances will appear over time as society adjusts.11Third, the slowdown may be overstated, perhaps greatly, because of measurement issues akin to those at work in the 1990s.12At this point, we cannot know which of these views may gain widespread acceptance, and monetary policy will play no significant role in how this puzzle is resolved.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20191008a.htm

2019-10-08,Data-Dependent Monetary Policy in an Evolving Economy,"Until recently, the official data showed job gains over the year through March 2019 of about 210,000 a month, which is far higher than necessary to absorb new entrants into the labor force and thus hold the unemployment rate constant.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20191008a.htm

2019-08-23,Challenges for Monetary Policy,The second era raises the question whether long expansions supported by better monetary policy inevitably lead to destabilizing financial excesses like those seen in the Great Moderation.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20190823a.htm
2019-08-23,Challenges for Monetary Policy,"The third era confronts us with the question of how best to promote sustained prosperity in a world of slow global growth, low inflation, and low interest rates.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20190823a.htm

2019-08-23,Challenges for Monetary Policy,"With the benefit of hindsight, the lack of stability is generally attributed to ""stop and go"" stabilization policy, as monetary and fiscal authorities grappled with how best to modulate the use of their blunt but powerful tools.3",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20190823a.htm
2019-08-23,Challenges for Monetary Policy,"Beginning in the mid-1960s, ""stop and go"" policy gave way to ""too much go and not enough stop""—not enough, that is, to quell rising inflation pressures.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20190823a.htm

2019-08-23,Challenges for Monetary Policy,"Era II, 1983 through 2009: the Great Moderation and Great RecessionAs the second era began, inflation was falling, and it continued to fall for about a decade (figure 2, panel C).",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20190823a.htm
2019-08-23,Challenges for Monetary Policy,"In 1993, core inflation, which omits the volatile food and energy components, first fell below 2.5 percent, and has since remained in the narrow range of 0.9 percent to 2.5 percent.5Greater success on price stability came with greater success on employment.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20190823a.htm

2019-08-23,Challenges for Monetary Policy,"By the turn of the century, it was beginning to look like financial excesses and global events would pose the main threats to stability in this new era rather than overheating and rising inflation.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20190823a.htm
2019-08-23,Challenges for Monetary Policy,"The collapse of the tech stock bubble in 2000 and the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks played key roles in precipitating a slowdown that turned into a recession.8And the next expansion, as we are all painfully aware, ended with the collapse of a housing bubble and the Global Financial Crisis.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20190823a.htm
2019-08-23,Challenges for Monetary Policy,"Thus, this second era provided good reason for optimism about the Fed's ability to deliver stable inflation, but also raised a question about whether long expansions inevitably lead to destabilizing financial excesses.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20190823a.htm
2019-08-23,Challenges for Monetary Policy,"Era III, 2010 and After: Monetary Policy and the Emerging New NormalThe third era began in 2010 as the recovery from the Great Recession was taking hold.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20190823a.htm

2019-08-23,Challenges for Monetary Policy,"I will fast-forward past the early years of the expansion and pick up the story in December 2015.9The unemployment rate had fallen from a peak of 10 percent to 5 percent, roughly equal to the median FOMC participant's estimate of the natural rate of unemployment at the time.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20190823a.htm
2019-08-23,Challenges for Monetary Policy,"At this point, the Committee decided that it was prudent to begin gradually raising the federal funds rate based on the closely monitored premise that the increasingly healthy economy called for more-normal interest rates.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20190823a.htm
2019-08-23,Challenges for Monetary Policy,"The premise was generally borne out: Growth from the end of 2015 to the end of 2018 averaged 2.5 percent, a bit above the 2.2 percent rate over the previous five years (figure 2, panel A).",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20190823a.htm

2019-08-23,Challenges for Monetary Policy,That brings us to 2019.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20190823a.htm
2019-08-23,Challenges for Monetary Policy,"Before turning to issues occupying center stage at present, I want to address a long-running issue that I discussed here last year: tracking the ""stars"" that serve as guideposts for monetary policy.10These include u*, the natural rate of unemployment, and r*, the neutral real rate of interest.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20190823a.htm

2019-08-23,Challenges for Monetary Policy,We must judge their locations as best we can based on incoming data and then add an element of risk management to be able to use them as guides.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20190823a.htm
2019-08-23,Challenges for Monetary Policy,"Since 2012, declining unemployment has had surprisingly little effect on inflation, prompting a steady decline in estimates of u* (figure 3).11Standard estimates of r* have declined between 2 and 3 percentage points over the past two decades.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20190823a.htm
2019-08-23,Challenges for Monetary Policy,Some argue that the effective decline is even larger.12Incorporating a lower value of u* into policymaking does not require a significant change in our approach.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20190823a.htm
2019-08-23,Challenges for Monetary Policy,"The significant fall in r*, however, may demand more fundamental change.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20190823a.htm
2019-08-23,Challenges for Monetary Policy,"A lower r* combined with low inflation means that interest rates will run, on average, significantly closer to their effective lower bound.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20190823a.htm
2019-08-23,Challenges for Monetary Policy,"The key question raised by this era, then, is how we can best support maximum employment and price stability in a world with a low neutral interest rate.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20190823a.htm
2019-08-23,Challenges for Monetary Policy,Current Policy and the Three Key QuestionsLet me turn now to the current implications for monetary policy of the questions raised by these three eras.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20190823a.htm

2019-08-23,Challenges for Monetary Policy,"Low inflation seems to be the problem of this era, not high inflation.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20190823a.htm

2019-08-23,Challenges for Monetary Policy,The second era's question—whether long expansions inevitably breed financial excesses—is a challenging and timely one.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20190823a.htm
2019-08-23,Challenges for Monetary Policy,"Hyman Minsky long argued that, as an expansion continues and memories of the previous downturn fade, financial risk management deteriorates and risks are increasingly underappreciated.13This observation has spurred much discussion.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20190823a.htm
2019-08-23,Challenges for Monetary Policy,"At the end of the day, we cannot prevent people from finding ways to take excessive financial risks.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20190823a.htm

2019-08-23,Challenges for Monetary Policy,"We have not seen unsustainable borrowing, financial booms, or other excesses of the sort that occurred at times during the Great Moderation, and I continue to judge overall financial stability risks to be moderate.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20190823a.htm
2019-08-23,Challenges for Monetary Policy,"That leaves the third question of how, in this low r* world, the Fed can best support the economy.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20190823a.htm

2019-08-23,Challenges for Monetary Policy,"Because the most important effects of monetary policy are felt with uncertain lags of a year or more, the Committee must attempt to look through what may be passing developments and focus on things that seem likely to affect the outlook over time or that pose a material risk of doing so.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20190823a.htm
2019-08-23,Challenges for Monetary Policy,"Risk management enters our decisionmaking because of both the uncertainty about the effects of recent developments and the uncertainty we face regarding structural aspects of the economy, including the natural rate of unemployment and the neutral rate of interest.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20190823a.htm
2019-08-23,Challenges for Monetary Policy,It will at times be appropriate for us to tilt policy one way or the other because of prominent risks.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20190823a.htm

2019-06-25,Economic Outlook and Monetary Policy Review,"Since then, the picture has changed.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20190625a.htm

2019-06-04,Opening Remarks,"In fact, in 1999 the Federal Reserve System hosted a conference titled ""Monetary Policy in a Low Inflation Environment.""",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20190604a.htm
2019-06-04,Opening Remarks,"Conference participants discussed new challenges that were emerging after the then-recent victory over the Great Inflation.1They focused on many questions posed by low inflation and, in particular, on what unconventional tools a central bank might use to support the economy if interest rates fell to what we now call the effective lower bound (ELB).",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20190604a.htm
2019-06-04,Opening Remarks,"Even though the Bank of Japan was grappling with the ELB as the conference met, the issue seemed remote for the United States.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20190604a.htm
2019-06-04,Opening Remarks,"The conference received little coverage in the financial press, but a Reuters wire service story titled ""Fed Conference Timing on Inflation Odd, but Useful"" emphasized the remoteness of the risk.2Participants at the conference could not have anticipated that only 10 years later, the world would be engulfed in a deep financial crisis, with unemployment soaring and central banks around the world making extensive use of new strategies, tools, and ways to communicate.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20190604a.htm

2019-06-04,Opening Remarks,Our obligation to the public we serve is to take those measures now that will put us in the best position deal with our next encounter with the ELB.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20190604a.htm

2019-06-04,Opening Remarks,"The review has several parts, all of which are intended to open our monetary policy to critical examination.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20190604a.htm

2019-06-04,Opening Remarks,We will publicly report the outcome of our discussions.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20190604a.htm

2019-06-04,Opening Remarks,"Before turning to the specifics of the review, I want to focus a little more closely on the challenges we face today.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20190604a.htm
2019-06-04,Opening Remarks,"For a reference point, at the time of the 1999 conference, the United States was eight years into an expansion; core inflation was 1.4 percent, and the unemployment rate was 4.1 percent—not so different from today.4Macroeconomists were puzzling over the flatness of the Phillips curve, the level of the natural rate of unemployment, and a possible acceleration in productivity growth—questions that are also with us today.5",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20190604a.htm
2019-06-04,Opening Remarks,"The big difference between then and now is that the federal funds rate was 5.2 percent—which, to underscore the point, put the rate 20 quarter-point rate cuts away from the ELB.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20190604a.htm
2019-06-04,Opening Remarks,"Since then, standard estimates of the longer-run normal or neutral rate of interest have declined between 2 and 3 percentage points, and some argue that the effective decline is even larger.6The combination of lower real interest rates and low inflation translates into lower nominal rates and a much higher likelihood that rates will fall to the ELB in a downturn.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20190604a.htm
2019-06-04,Opening Remarks,"As the experience of the past decade showed, extended ELB episodes can be associated with painfully high unemployment and slow growth or recession.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20190604a.htm
2019-06-04,Opening Remarks,"Economic weakness puts downward pressure on inflation, which can raise real interest rates and reinforce the challenge of supporting needed job growth.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20190604a.htm
2019-06-04,Opening Remarks,"In addition, over time, inflation has become much less sensitive to tightness in resource utilization.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20190604a.htm
2019-06-04,Opening Remarks,"This insensitivity can be a blessing in avoiding deflation when unemployment is high, but it means that much greater labor market tightness may ultimately be required to bring inflation back to target in a recovery.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20190604a.htm
2019-06-04,Opening Remarks,Using monetary policy to push sufficiently hard on labor markets to lift inflation could pose risks of destabilizing excesses in financial markets or elsewhere.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20190604a.htm
2019-06-04,Opening Remarks,"In short, the proximity of interest rates to the ELB has become the preeminent monetary policy challenge of our time, tainting all manner of issues with ELB risk and imbuing many old challenges with greater significance.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20190604a.htm
2019-06-04,Opening Remarks,"For example, the behavior of inflation7now draws much sharper focus.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20190604a.htm
2019-06-04,Opening Remarks,"When nominal interest rates were around 4 or 5 percent, a low-side surprise of a few tenths on inflation did not raise the specter of the ELB.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20190604a.htm
2019-06-04,Opening Remarks,But the world has changed.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20190604a.htm
2019-06-04,Opening Remarks,Core inflation is currently running a bit below 2 percent on a trailing 12-month basis.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20190604a.htm
2019-06-04,Opening Remarks,"In this setting, a similar low-side surprise, if it were to persist, would bring us uncomfortably closer to the ELB.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20190604a.htm
2019-06-04,Opening Remarks,My FOMC colleagues and I must—and do—take seriously the risk that inflation shortfalls that persist even in a robust economy could precipitate a difficult-to-arrest downward drift in inflation expectations.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20190604a.htm
2019-06-04,Opening Remarks,At the heart of the review is the evaluation of potential changes to our strategy designed to strengthen the credibility of our symmetric 2 percent inflation objective.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20190604a.htm
2019-06-04,Opening Remarks,The ELB problem also complicates the FOMC's efforts to achieve transparency and accountability.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20190604a.htm
2019-06-04,Opening Remarks,"The Fed, like most major central banks, is insulated from short-term political pressures.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20190604a.htm
2019-06-04,Opening Remarks,"In our democracy, that insulation carries with it an obligation for us to be transparent and publicly accountable.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20190604a.htm
2019-06-04,Opening Remarks,"When policy rates reached the ELB during the crisis, central banks resorted to what were then new, untested tools to pursue their mandated goals.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20190604a.htm
2019-06-04,Opening Remarks,"These tools are no longer new, but their efficacy, costs, and risks remain less well understood than the traditional approaches to central banking.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20190604a.htm
2019-06-04,Opening Remarks,My FOMC colleagues and I are committed to explaining why the use of these tools in the wake of the crisis was a prudent and effective approach to pursuing our congressional mandate and why tools like these are likely to be needed again.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20190604a.htm
2019-06-04,Opening Remarks,Our review is but one part of our efforts to engage with the public on these matters.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20190604a.htm
2019-06-04,Opening Remarks,"Let me turn to the specifics of the review, which is focused on three questions:",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20190604a.htm
2019-06-04,Opening Remarks,"These questions are quite broad, and my colleagues and I come to them with open minds.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20190604a.htm
2019-06-04,Opening Remarks,"We believe our current policy framework is working well, and we have made no decisions about particular changes.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20190604a.htm
2019-06-04,Opening Remarks,"In fact, the review is still in its early stages.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20190604a.htm
2019-06-04,Opening Remarks,The first question raises the issue of whether the FOMC should use makeup strategies in response to ELB risks.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20190604a.htm
2019-06-04,Opening Remarks,"By the time of the 1999 conference, research was beginning to show that—in models, at least—such strategies could substantially reduce the unemployment and other costs of ELB spells.8The simplest version goes like this: Suppose that a spell with interest rates near the ELB leads to a persistent shortfall of inflation relative to the central bank's goal.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20190604a.htm
2019-06-04,Opening Remarks,But what if the central bank promised credibly that it would deliberately make up for any lost inflation by stimulating the economy and temporarily pushing inflation modestly above the target?,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20190604a.htm
2019-06-04,Opening Remarks,"In the models, the prospect of future stimulus promotes anticipatory consumption and investment that could greatly reduce the pain of being at the ELB.9Policymakers discussed this reasoning in the wake of the crisis, but neither the Fed nor any other major central bank chose to pursue such a policy.10Why?",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20190604a.htm
2019-06-04,Opening Remarks,"For makeup strategies to work, households and businesses must go out on a limb, so to speak, raising spending in the midst of a downturn.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20190604a.htm
2019-06-04,Opening Remarks,"In theory, they would do this based on their confidence that the central bank will deliver the makeup stimulus at some point—perhaps years in the future.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20190604a.htm
2019-06-04,Opening Remarks,"In models, great confidence in central bankers is achieved by assumption.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20190604a.htm
2019-06-04,Opening Remarks,"Despite the flattering nature of this assumption, crisis-era policymakers had major questions about whether their promise of good times to come would really have moved the hearts, minds, and pocketbooks of the public.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20190604a.htm
2019-06-04,Opening Remarks,Part of the problem was that the groundwork had not been laid in advance of the downturn—a problem we could hope to fix well before next time.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20190604a.htm
2019-06-04,Opening Remarks,Policymakers also had deeper concerns about the legitimacy and effectiveness of attempting to bind some future FOMC to take actions that could be objectionable from a short-term perspective when the time came to deliver.11,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20190604a.htm
2019-06-04,Opening Remarks,Research on makeup strategies has begun to grapple more seriously with the credibility questions.12But important questions remain.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20190604a.htm
2019-06-04,Opening Remarks,"To achieve buy-in by households and businesses, a comprehensible, credible, and actionable makeup strategy will need to be followed by years of central bank policy consistent with that strategy.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20190604a.htm
2019-06-04,Opening Remarks,The second question asks about the adequacy of the Fed's toolkit for providing stimulus when facing the ELB.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20190604a.htm
2019-06-04,Opening Remarks,"In the United States, we used several different formulations of both forward guidance and large‑scale purchases of longer-term securities.13While views differ on the effectiveness of these policies, with their use, the unemployment rate fell steadily and inflation expectations remained well anchored, outcomes that were favorable overall when viewed against the recoveries of many other advanced economies.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20190604a.htm
2019-06-04,Opening Remarks,"My own view is that these policies provided meaningful support for demand, but that they should not be thought of as a perfect substitute for our traditional interest rate tool.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20190604a.htm
2019-06-04,Opening Remarks,"In any case, we have a responsibility to thoroughly evaluate what mix of these tools is likely to work best when the next ELB episode arrives.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20190604a.htm
2019-06-04,Opening Remarks,"Perhaps it is time to retire the term ""unconventional"" when referring to tools that were used in the crisis.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20190604a.htm
2019-06-04,Opening Remarks,"We know that tools like these are likely to be needed in some form in future ELB spells, which we hope will be rare.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20190604a.htm
2019-06-04,Opening Remarks,"We now have a significant body of evidence regarding the effectiveness, costs, and risks of these tools, including those used by the FOMC and others tried elsewhere.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20190604a.htm
2019-06-04,Opening Remarks,Our plans must take advantage of this growing understanding as assessments are refined.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20190604a.htm
2019-06-04,Opening Remarks,"The third question concerns improving communication, which I discussed earlier from the standpoint of governance and accountability.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20190604a.htm
2019-06-04,Opening Remarks,But transparency also plays a central role in policy effectiveness through its effects on the expectations of households and businesses.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20190604a.htm
2019-06-04,Opening Remarks,"Of course, this was the major insight behind the transparency revolution in central banking over the past few decades.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20190604a.htm
2019-06-04,Opening Remarks,"Today, central banks publicly share a large and ever-increasing amount of information about policy.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20190604a.htm

2019-06-04,Opening Remarks,"But we have been living in times characterized by large, frequent, unexpected changes in the underlying structure of the economy.15In this environment, the most important policy message may be about how the central bank will respond to the unexpected rather than what it will do if there are no surprises.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20190604a.htm

2019-05-20,Business Debt and Our Dynamic Financial System,"The acronyms have changed a bit—""CLOs"" (collateralized loan obligations) instead of ""CDOs"" (collateralized debt obligations), for example—but once again, we see a category of debt that is growing faster than the income of the borrowers even as lenders loosen underwriting standards.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20190520a.htm
2019-05-20,Business Debt and Our Dynamic Financial System,"Likewise, much of the borrowing is financed opaquely, outside the banking system.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20190520a.htm

2019-05-20,Business Debt and Our Dynamic Financial System,"And there are other differences: Increases in business borrowing are not outsized for such a long expansion, in contrast to the mortgage boom; business credit is not fueled by a dramatic asset price bubble, as mortgage debt was; and CLO structures are much sounder than the structures that were in use during the mortgage credit bubble.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20190520a.htm

2019-05-20,Business Debt and Our Dynamic Financial System,"In addition, underwriting standards have weakened.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20190520a.htm
2019-05-20,Business Debt and Our Dynamic Financial System,"With leveraged loans, covenants intended to protect lenders may be an endangered species; more loans now feature high debt-to-earnings ratios; and the use of optimistic projections including ""earnings add-backs"" is becoming more common.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20190520a.htm

2019-05-20,Business Debt and Our Dynamic Financial System,"Finally, when the financial system funds long-maturity assets with short-maturity liabilities, we risk a classic ""fast burn"" crisis—a bank run, or its equivalent involving investors and institutions outside traditional banking.2",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20190520a.htm
2019-05-20,Business Debt and Our Dynamic Financial System,"In our framework, the story of the mid-2000s goes something like this: Amid a self-reinforcing cycle of house price gains and mortgage credit expansion, households borrowed (and lenders lent) far too much, and property prices rose far too high.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20190520a.htm
2019-05-20,Business Debt and Our Dynamic Financial System,Financial institutions of all shapes and sizes also borrowed too much.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20190520a.htm
2019-05-20,Business Debt and Our Dynamic Financial System,"And the financial sector was highly susceptible to a run because it funded risky, long-maturity mortgages with extended chains of fragile and opaque financing structures that ultimately rested on short-maturity liabilities.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20190520a.htm
2019-05-20,Business Debt and Our Dynamic Financial System,"Let's compare this story with the current situation using our four-point checklist, beginning with borrowing by businesses and households.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20190520a.htm

2019-05-20,Business Debt and Our Dynamic Financial System,But the growth in the ratio of business debt to GDP in the past decade is much less than the growth in household debt to GDP that we saw in the run-up to the Global Financial Crisis.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20190520a.htm
2019-05-20,Business Debt and Our Dynamic Financial System,"Back then, household debt grew from 60 percent of GDP to 90 percent, or by half (figure 5).",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20190520a.htm

2019-05-20,Business Debt and Our Dynamic Financial System,Business debt rises in expansions.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20190520a.htm
2019-05-20,Business Debt and Our Dynamic Financial System,It is a steady upward plod in borrowing over the long expansion—not a rapid expansion—that has now brought business debt to GDP back to historic highs.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20190520a.htm
2019-05-20,Business Debt and Our Dynamic Financial System,"Seen this way, the current situation looks typical of business cycles.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20190520a.htm

2019-05-20,Business Debt and Our Dynamic Financial System,"As for household debt, we see that household debt-to-income ratios have steadily declined post-crisis.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20190520a.htm
2019-05-20,Business Debt and Our Dynamic Financial System,"Moreover, a high and rising fraction of this debt is rated prime.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20190520a.htm
2019-05-20,Business Debt and Our Dynamic Financial System,"All told, household debt burdens appear much more manageable.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20190520a.htm
2019-05-20,Business Debt and Our Dynamic Financial System,Our second factor—valuation pressures—also points to moderate risks to financial stability.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20190520a.htm

2019-05-20,Business Debt and Our Dynamic Financial System,All of these developments point to strong risk appetite—as might be expected given the strong economy.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20190520a.htm
2019-05-20,Business Debt and Our Dynamic Financial System,"But there does not appear to be a feedback loop between borrowing and asset prices, as was the case in the run-up to the financial crisis.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20190520a.htm
2019-05-20,Business Debt and Our Dynamic Financial System,"While borrowing by businesses has been strong, it is not fueling excessive prices or investment in a critical sector such as housing, whose collapse would undermine collateral values and lead to outsized losses.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20190520a.htm
2019-05-20,Business Debt and Our Dynamic Financial System,"Instead, the increase in business borrowing has been broad based across sectors, including technology, oil and gas production, and manufacturing.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20190520a.htm

2019-05-20,Business Debt and Our Dynamic Financial System,"Our post-crisis regulatory framework is based on robust capital requirements backed by strong stress tests, resulting in much higher levels of capital in the banking system (figure 6).",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20190520a.htm
2019-05-20,Business Debt and Our Dynamic Financial System,These stress tests are a way to estimate the direct and indirect effects of extremely bad macroeconomic and financial developments on our banking system.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20190520a.htm

2019-05-20,Business Debt and Our Dynamic Financial System,"Since we began routine stress-testing in 2011, the scenarios we use have featured severe global recessions characterized by major stress in the corporate sector, where large numbers of firms default on their loans and bonds.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20190520a.htm

2019-05-20,Business Debt and Our Dynamic Financial System,"In part because of the post-crisis regulatory regime, large banks hold substantial amounts of highly liquid assets and rely relatively little on short-term wholesale funding (figure 7).",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20190520a.htm
2019-05-20,Business Debt and Our Dynamic Financial System,Money market funds hold much safer assets.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20190520a.htm

2019-05-20,Business Debt and Our Dynamic Financial System,"As a result, some businesses may come under severe financial strain if the economy deteriorates.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20190520a.htm

2019-03-08,Monetary Policy: Normalization and the Road Ahead,"This is a feature of ""normal"" that we are returning to: After normalization, the size of the Fed's balance sheet will once again be driven by the demand for our liabilities.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20190308a.htm

2019-03-08,Monetary Policy: Normalization and the Road Ahead,"In January, the Committee stated its intention to continue in our current regime in which our main policy rate, the federal funds rate or possibly some successor, is held within its target range by the interest rates we set on reserves and on the overnight reverse repo facility.3In this system, active management of the supply of reserves is not required.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20190308a.htm
2019-03-08,Monetary Policy: Normalization and the Road Ahead,"Thus, the supply of reserves must be ""ample,"" in the sense of being sufficient to satisfy reserve demands even in the face of volatility in factors affecting the reserve market.4Put another way, the quantity of reserves will equal the typical reserve demands of depositories plus a buffer to allow for reserve market fluctuations.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20190308a.htm

2019-03-08,Monetary Policy: Normalization and the Road Ahead,"Once balance sheet runoff ends, we may, if appropriate, hold the size of the balance sheet constant for a time to allow reserves to very gradually decline to the desired level as other liabilities, such as currency, increase.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20190308a.htm

2019-03-08,Monetary Policy: Normalization and the Road Ahead,"The most significant change from the standpoint of forward guidance is that, since January 2012, the FOMC's quarterly Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) has included federal funds rate projections reaching up to three years into the future--often referred to as the ""dot plot.""",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20190308a.htm

2019-03-08,Monetary Policy: Normalization and the Road Ahead,"Can the Federal Reserve best meet its statutory objectives with its existing monetary policy strategy, or should it consider strategies that aim to reverse past misses of the inflation objective?",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20190308a.htm
2019-03-08,Monetary Policy: Normalization and the Road Ahead,"Are the existing monetary policy tools adequate to achieve and maintain maximum employment and price stability, or should the toolkit be expanded?",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20190308a.htm

2019-03-08,Monetary Policy: Normalization and the Road Ahead,I would like to spend a few minutes discussing the first topic.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20190308a.htm
2019-03-08,Monetary Policy: Normalization and the Road Ahead,"Because interest rates around the world have steadily declined for several decades, rates in normal times now tend to be much closer to zero than in the past (figure 5).8Thus, when a recession comes, the Fed is likely to have less capacity to cut interest rates to stimulate the economy than in the past, suggesting that trips to the ELB may be more frequent.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20190308a.htm
2019-03-08,Monetary Policy: Normalization and the Road Ahead,"The post-crisis period has seen many economies around the world stuck for an extended period at the ELB, with slow growth and inflation well below target.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20190308a.htm
2019-03-08,Monetary Policy: Normalization and the Road Ahead,"Persistently weak inflation could lead inflation expectations to drift downward, which would imply still lower interest rates, leaving even less room for central banks to cut interest rates to support the economy during a downturn.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20190308a.htm
2019-03-08,Monetary Policy: Normalization and the Road Ahead,It is therefore very important for central banks to find more effective ways to battle the low-inflation syndrome that seems to accompany proximity to the ELB.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20190308a.htm
2019-03-08,Monetary Policy: Normalization and the Road Ahead,"In the late 1990s, motivated by the Japanese experience with deflation and sluggish economic performance, economists began developing the argument that a central bank might substantially reduce the economic costs of ELB spells by adopting a makeup strategy.9The simplest version goes like this: If a spell with interest rates near the ELB leads to a persistent shortfall of inflation relative to the central bank's goal, once the ELB spell ends, the central bank would deliberately make up for the lost inflation by stimulating the economy and temporarily pushing inflation modestly above the target.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20190308a.htm
2019-03-08,Monetary Policy: Normalization and the Road Ahead,"In standard macroeconomic models, if households and businesses are confident that this future inflationary stimulus will be coming, that prospect will promote anticipatory consumption and investment.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20190308a.htm
2019-03-08,Monetary Policy: Normalization and the Road Ahead,"This can substantially reduce the economic costs of ELB spells.10Researchers have suggested many variations on makeup strategies.11For example, the central bank could target average inflation over time, implying that misses on either side of the target would be offset.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20190308a.htm
2019-03-08,Monetary Policy: Normalization and the Road Ahead,"By the time of the crisis, there was a well-established body of model-based research suggesting that some kind of makeup policy could be beneficial.12In light of this research, one might ask why the Fed and other major central banks chose not to pursue such a policy.13The answer lies in the uncertain distance between models and reality.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20190308a.htm
2019-03-08,Monetary Policy: Normalization and the Road Ahead,"For makeup strategies to achieve their stabilizing benefits, households and businesses must be quite confident that the ""makeup stimulus"" is really coming.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20190308a.htm
2019-03-08,Monetary Policy: Normalization and the Road Ahead,This confidence is what prompts them to raise spending and investment in the midst of a downturn.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20190308a.htm

2019-03-08,Monetary Policy: Normalization and the Road Ahead,"In practice, when policymakers considered these policies in the wake of the crisis, they had major questions about whether a central bank's promise of good times to come would have moved the hearts, minds, and pocketbooks of the public.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20190308a.htm
2019-03-08,Monetary Policy: Normalization and the Road Ahead,"Part of the problem is that when the time comes to deliver the inflationary stimulus, that policy is likely to be unpopular--what is known as the time consistency problem in economics.14",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20190308a.htm
2019-03-08,Monetary Policy: Normalization and the Road Ahead,Experience in the United States and around the world suggests that more frequent ELB episodes could prove quite costly in the future.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20190308a.htm

2019-02-28,Recent Economic Developments and Longer-Term Challenges,"To understand the causes of the slowdown, it is useful to divide growth into two components: (1) growth in the cumulative number of hours of worked by all workers and (2) growth in the amount of output derived, on average, from each hour of work.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20190228b.htm

2019-02-28,Recent Economic Developments and Longer-Term Challenges,"Demographic factors are generally slow moving and predictable, and there is no surprise in the fact that slower population growth and the retirement of the baby boomers are now contributing to slower growth in the total amount of work performed in the economy.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20190228b.htm

2019-02-28,Recent Economic Developments and Longer-Term Challenges,"In the mid-1990s, the United States ranked in the upper tier for prime-age women's participation, but since then participation by women has advanced rapidly in many countries while it has declined slightly in the United States.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20190228b.htm

2019-02-28,Recent Economic Developments and Longer-Term Challenges,But the international experience suggests that this outcome is not inevitable: The drop in participation among those with less education is much smaller in some comparable countries than in the United States.7,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20190228b.htm
2019-02-28,Recent Economic Developments and Longer-Term Challenges,"The research into labor force participation in the United States and across the world does not find a magic fix, but it does suggest a variety of policies that might better prepare people for the modern workforce as well as support and reward labor force participation.8I should note that the Fed has neither the tools nor the mandate to directly address the forces that are holding back labor force participation.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20190228b.htm

2019-02-28,Recent Economic Developments and Longer-Term Challenges,"When measured annually, labor productivity growth is volatile, but focusing on five-year averages, we can see that from 1975 through 2007, productivity growth averaged about 2 percent while fluctuating between about 1 and 4 percent (figure 10).",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20190228b.htm

2020-08-27,New Economic Challenges and the Fed's Monetary Policy Review,"Chair Paul Volcker brought that focus to bear, and the ""Volcker disinflation,"" with the continuing stewardship of Alan Greenspan, led to the stabilization of inflation and inflation expectations in the 1990s at around 2 percent.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20200827a.htm

2020-08-27,New Economic Challenges and the Fed's Monetary Policy Review,"Since then, prior to the current pandemic-induced downturn, a series of historically long expansions had been more likely to end with episodes of financial instability, prompting essential efforts to substantially increase the strength and resilience of the financial system.4",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20200827a.htm
2020-08-27,New Economic Challenges and the Fed's Monetary Policy Review,"By the early 2000s, many central banks around the world had adopted a monetary policy framework known as inflation targeting.5Although the precise features of inflation targeting differed from country to country, the core framework always articulated an inflation goal as a primary objective of monetary policy.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20200827a.htm

2020-08-27,New Economic Challenges and the Fed's Monetary Policy Review,"Under Ben Bernanke's leadership, the Federal Reserve adopted many of the features associated with flexible inflation targeting.6We made great advances in transparency and communications, with the initiation of quarterly press conferences and the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP), which comprises the individual economic forecasts of FOMC participants.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20200827a.htm

2020-08-27,New Economic Challenges and the Fed's Monetary Policy Review,"A central part of this statement was the articulation of a longer-run inflation goal of 2 percent.7Because the structure of the labor market is strongly influenced by nonmonetary factors that can change over time, the Committee did not set a numerical objective for maximum employment.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20200827a.htm

2020-08-27,New Economic Challenges and the Fed's Monetary Policy Review,A key purpose of our review has been to take stock of the lessons learned over this period and identify any further changes in our monetary policy framework that could enhance our ability to achieve our maximum-employment and price-stability objectives in the years ahead.9,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20200827a.htm
2020-08-27,New Economic Challenges and the Fed's Monetary Policy Review,Our evolving understanding of four key economic developments motivated our review.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20200827a.htm
2020-08-27,New Economic Challenges and the Fed's Monetary Policy Review,"First, assessments of the potential, or longer-run, growth rate of the economy have declined.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20200827a.htm
2020-08-27,New Economic Challenges and the Fed's Monetary Policy Review,"For example, since January 2012, the median estimate of potential growth from FOMC participants has fallen from 2.5 percent to 1.8 percent (seefigure 1).",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20200827a.htm
2020-08-27,New Economic Challenges and the Fed's Monetary Policy Review,"Some slowing in growth relative to earlier decades was to be expected, reflecting slowing population growth and the aging of the population.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20200827a.htm
2020-08-27,New Economic Challenges and the Fed's Monetary Policy Review,"More troubling has been the decline in productivity growth, which is the primary driver of improving living standards over time.10",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20200827a.htm
2020-08-27,New Economic Challenges and the Fed's Monetary Policy Review,"Second, the general level of interest rates has fallen both here in the United States and around the world.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20200827a.htm
2020-08-27,New Economic Challenges and the Fed's Monetary Policy Review,"Estimates of the neutral federal funds rate, which is the rate consistent with the economy operating at full strength and with stable inflation, have fallen substantially, in large part reflecting a fall in the equilibrium real interest rate, or ""r-star.""",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20200827a.htm
2020-08-27,New Economic Challenges and the Fed's Monetary Policy Review,"This rate is not affected by monetary policy but instead is driven by fundamental factors in the economy, including demographics and productivity growth—the same factors that drive potential economic growth.11The median estimate from FOMC participants of the neutral federal funds rate has fallen by nearly half since early 2012, from 4.25 percent to 2.5 percent (seefigure 2).",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20200827a.htm
2020-08-27,New Economic Challenges and the Fed's Monetary Policy Review,This decline in assessments of the neutral federal funds rate has profound implications for monetary policy.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20200827a.htm
2020-08-27,New Economic Challenges and the Fed's Monetary Policy Review,"With interest rates generally running closer to their effective lower bound even in good times, the Fed has less scope to support the economy during an economic downturn by simply cutting the federal funds rate.12The result can be worse economic outcomes in terms of both employment and price stability, with the costs of such outcomes likely falling hardest on those least able to bear them.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20200827a.htm
2020-08-27,New Economic Challenges and the Fed's Monetary Policy Review,"Third, and on a happier note, the record-long expansion that ended earlier this year led to the best labor market we had seen in some time.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20200827a.htm
2020-08-27,New Economic Challenges and the Fed's Monetary Policy Review,"The unemployment rate hovered near 50-year lows for roughly 2 years, well below most estimates of its sustainable level.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20200827a.htm

2020-08-27,New Economic Challenges and the Fed's Monetary Policy Review,"Having declined significantly in the five years following the crisis, the labor force participation rate flattened out and began rising even though the aging of the population suggested that it should keep falling.13For individuals in their prime working years, the participation rate fully retraced its post-crisis decline, defying earlier assessments that the Global Financial Crisis might cause permanent structural damage to the labor market.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20200827a.htm
2020-08-27,New Economic Challenges and the Fed's Monetary Policy Review,"Moreover, as the long expansion continued, the gains began to be shared more widely across society.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20200827a.htm
2020-08-27,New Economic Challenges and the Fed's Monetary Policy Review,"The Black and Hispanic unemployment rates reached record lows, and the differentials between these rates and the white unemployment rate narrowed to their lowest levels on record.14As we heard repeatedly in ourFed Listensevents, the robust job market was delivering life-changing gains for many individuals, families, and communities, particularly at the lower end of the income spectrum.15In addition, many who had been left behind for too long were finding jobs, benefiting their families and communities, and increasing the productive capacity of our economy.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20200827a.htm
2020-08-27,New Economic Challenges and the Fed's Monetary Policy Review,"Before the pandemic, there was every reason to expect that these gains would continue.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20200827a.htm
2020-08-27,New Economic Challenges and the Fed's Monetary Policy Review,"It is hard to overstate the benefits of sustaining a strong labor market, a key national goal that will require a range of policies in addition to supportive monetary policy.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20200827a.htm
2020-08-27,New Economic Challenges and the Fed's Monetary Policy Review,"Fourth, the historically strong labor market did not trigger a significant rise in inflation.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20200827a.htm
2020-08-27,New Economic Challenges and the Fed's Monetary Policy Review,"Over the years, forecasts from FOMC participants and private-sector analysts routinely showed a return to 2 percent inflation, but these forecasts were never realized on a sustained basis (seefigure 3).",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20200827a.htm
2020-08-27,New Economic Challenges and the Fed's Monetary Policy Review,"Inflation forecasts are typically predicated on estimates of the natural rate of unemployment, or ""u-star,"" and of how much upward pressure on inflation arises when the unemployment rate falls relative to u-star.16As the unemployment rate moved lower and inflation remained muted, estimates of u-star were revised down.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20200827a.htm
2020-08-27,New Economic Challenges and the Fed's Monetary Policy Review,"For example, the median estimate from FOMC participants declined from 5.5 percent in 2012 to 4.1 percent at present (seefigure 4).",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20200827a.htm
2020-08-27,New Economic Challenges and the Fed's Monetary Policy Review,"The muted responsiveness of inflation to labor market tightness, which we refer to as the flattening of the Phillips curve, also contributed to low inflation outcomes.17In addition, longer-term inflation expectations, which we have long seen as an important driver of actual inflation, and global disinflationary pressures may have been holding down inflation more than was generally anticipated.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20200827a.htm

2020-08-27,New Economic Challenges and the Fed's Monetary Policy Review,"Inflation that runs below its desired level can lead to an unwelcome fall in longer-term inflation expectations, which, in turn, can pull actual inflation even lower, resulting in an adverse cycle of ever-lower inflation and inflation expectations.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20200827a.htm

2020-08-27,New Economic Challenges and the Fed's Monetary Policy Review,"Well-anchored inflation expectations are critical for giving the Fed the latitude to support employment when necessary without destabilizing inflation.18But if inflation expectations fall below our 2 percent objective, interest rates would decline in tandem.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20200827a.htm

2020-08-27,New Economic Challenges and the Fed's Monetary Policy Review,One of the clear messages we heard was that the strong labor market that prevailed before the pandemic was generating employment opportunities for many Americans who in the past had not found jobs readily available.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20200827a.htm
2020-08-27,New Economic Challenges and the Fed's Monetary Policy Review,"A clear takeaway from these events was the importance of achieving and sustaining a strong job market, particularly for people from low- and moderate-income communities.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20200827a.htm
2020-08-27,New Economic Challenges and the Fed's Monetary Policy Review,"The research conference brought together some of the world's leading academic experts to address topics central to our review, and the presentations and robust discussion we engaged in were an important input to our review process.20",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20200827a.htm

2020-08-27,New Economic Challenges and the Fed's Monetary Policy Review,"New Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy StrategyThe federated structure of the Federal Reserve, reflected in the FOMC, ensures that we always have a diverse range of perspectives on monetary policy, and that is certainly the case today.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20200827a.htm
2020-08-27,New Economic Challenges and the Fed's Monetary Policy Review,"Nonetheless, I am pleased to say that the revised consensus statement was adopted today with the unanimous support of Committee participants.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20200827a.htm
2020-08-27,New Economic Challenges and the Fed's Monetary Policy Review,"Our new consensus statement, like its predecessor, explains how we interpret the mandate Congress has given us and describes the broad framework that we believe will best promote our maximum-employment and price-stability goals.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20200827a.htm
2020-08-27,New Economic Challenges and the Fed's Monetary Policy Review,"Before addressing the key changes in our statement, let me highlight some areas of continuity.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20200827a.htm
2020-08-27,New Economic Challenges and the Fed's Monetary Policy Review,"We continue to believe that specifying a numerical goal for employment is unwise, because the maximum level of employment is not directly measurable and changes over time for reasons unrelated to monetary policy.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20200827a.htm
2020-08-27,New Economic Challenges and the Fed's Monetary Policy Review,The significant shifts in estimates of the natural rate of unemployment over the past decade reinforce this point.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20200827a.htm
2020-08-27,New Economic Challenges and the Fed's Monetary Policy Review,"In addition, we have not changed our view that a longer-run inflation rate of 2 percent is most consistent with our mandate to promote both maximum employment and price stability.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20200827a.htm
2020-08-27,New Economic Challenges and the Fed's Monetary Policy Review,"Finally, we continue to believe that monetary policy must be forward looking, taking into account the expectations of households and businesses and the lags in monetary policy's effect on the economy.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20200827a.htm
2020-08-27,New Economic Challenges and the Fed's Monetary Policy Review,"Thus, our policy actions continue to depend on the economic outlook as well as the risks to the outlook, including potential risks to the financial system that could impede the attainment of our goals.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20200827a.htm
2020-08-27,New Economic Challenges and the Fed's Monetary Policy Review,The key innovations in our new consensus statement reflect the changes in the economy I described.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20200827a.htm

2020-08-27,New Economic Challenges and the Fed's Monetary Policy Review,"By reducing our scope to support the economy by cutting interest rates, the lower bound increases downward risks to employment and inflation.22To counter these risks, we are prepared to use our full range of tools to support the economy.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20200827a.htm
2020-08-27,New Economic Challenges and the Fed's Monetary Policy Review,"With regard to the employment side of our mandate, our revised statement emphasizes that maximum employment is a broad-based and inclusive goal.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20200827a.htm
2020-08-27,New Economic Challenges and the Fed's Monetary Policy Review,"This change reflects our appreciation for the benefits of a strong labor market, particularly for many in low- and moderate-income communities.23In addition, our revised statement says that our policy decision will be informed by our ""assessments of theshortfallsof employment from its maximum level"" rather than by ""deviationsfrom its maximum level"" as in our previous statement.24This change may appear subtle, but it reflects our view that a robust job market can be sustained without causing an outbreak of inflation.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20200827a.htm
2020-08-27,New Economic Challenges and the Fed's Monetary Policy Review,"In earlier decades when the Phillips curve was steeper, inflation tended to rise noticeably in response to a strengthening labor market.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20200827a.htm
2020-08-27,New Economic Challenges and the Fed's Monetary Policy Review,It was sometimes appropriate for the Fed to tighten monetary policy as employment rose toward its estimated maximum level in order to stave off an unwelcome rise in inflation.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20200827a.htm
2020-08-27,New Economic Challenges and the Fed's Monetary Policy Review,"The change to ""shortfalls"" clarifies that, going forward, employment can run at or above real-time estimates of its maximum level without causing concern, unless accompanied by signs of unwanted increases in inflation or the emergence of other risks that could impede the attainment of our goals.25Of course, when employment is below its maximum level, as is clearly the case now, we will actively seek to minimize that shortfall by using our tools to support economic growth and job creation.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20200827a.htm
2020-08-27,New Economic Challenges and the Fed's Monetary Policy Review,We have also made important changes with regard to the price-stability side of our mandate.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20200827a.htm
2020-08-27,New Economic Challenges and the Fed's Monetary Policy Review,Our longer-run goal continues to be an inflation rate of 2 percent.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20200827a.htm
2020-08-27,New Economic Challenges and the Fed's Monetary Policy Review,Our statement emphasizes that our actions to achieve both sides of our dual mandate will be most effective if longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2 percent.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20200827a.htm
2020-08-27,New Economic Challenges and the Fed's Monetary Policy Review,"However, if inflation runs below 2 percent following economic downturns but never moves above 2 percent even when the economy is strong, then, over time, inflation will average less than 2 percent.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20200827a.htm
2020-08-27,New Economic Challenges and the Fed's Monetary Policy Review,"Households and businesses will come to expect this result, meaning that inflation expectations would tend to move below our inflation goal and pull realized inflation down.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20200827a.htm
2020-08-27,New Economic Challenges and the Fed's Monetary Policy Review,"To prevent this outcome and the adverse dynamics that could ensue, our new statement indicates that we will seek to achieve inflation that averages 2 percent over time.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20200827a.htm
2020-08-27,New Economic Challenges and the Fed's Monetary Policy Review,"Therefore, following periods when inflation has been running below 2 percent, appropriate monetary policy will likely aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20200827a.htm
2020-08-27,New Economic Challenges and the Fed's Monetary Policy Review,"In seeking to achieve inflation that averages 2 percent over time, we are not tying ourselves to a particular mathematical formula that defines the average.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20200827a.htm
2020-08-27,New Economic Challenges and the Fed's Monetary Policy Review,"Thus, our approach could be viewed as a flexible form of average inflation targeting.26Our decisions about appropriate monetary policy will continue to reflect a broad array of considerations and will not be dictated by any formula.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20200827a.htm
2020-08-27,New Economic Challenges and the Fed's Monetary Policy Review,"Of course, if excessive inflationary pressures were to build or inflation expectations were to ratchet above levels consistent with our goal, we would not hesitate to act.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20200827a.htm
2020-08-27,New Economic Challenges and the Fed's Monetary Policy Review,The revisions to our statement add up to a robust updating of our monetary policy framework.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20200827a.htm

2020-08-27,New Economic Challenges and the Fed's Monetary Policy Review,"Overall, our new Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy conveys our continued strong commitment to achieving our goals, given the difficult challenges presented by the proximity of interest rates to the effective lower bound.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20200827a.htm

2021-08-27,Monetary Policy in the Time of COVID,"After faltering last winter, job gains have risen steadily over the course of this year and now average 832,000 over the past three months, of which almost 800,000 have been in services (figure 2).",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20210827a.htm
2021-08-27,Monetary Policy in the Time of COVID,The pace of total hiring is faster than at any time in the recorded data before the pandemic.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20210827a.htm
2021-08-27,Monetary Policy in the Time of COVID,"The levels of job openings and quits are at record highs, and employers report that they cannot fill jobs fast enough to meet returning demand.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20210827a.htm
2021-08-27,Monetary Policy in the Time of COVID,These favorable conditions for job seekers should help the economy cover the considerable remaining ground to reach maximum employment.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20210827a.htm
2021-08-27,Monetary Policy in the Time of COVID,"The unemployment rate has declined to 5.4 percent, a post-pandemic low, but is still much too high, and the reported rate understates the amount of labor market slack.5Long-term unemployment remains elevated, and the recovery in labor force participation has lagged well behind the rest of the labor market, as it has in past recoveries.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20210827a.htm
2021-08-27,Monetary Policy in the Time of COVID,"With vaccinations rising, schools reopening, and enhanced unemployment benefits ending, some factors that may be holding back job seekers are likely fading.6While the Delta variant presents a near-term risk, the prospects are good for continued progress toward maximum employment.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20210827a.htm
2021-08-27,Monetary Policy in the Time of COVID,The Path Ahead: InflationThe rapid reopening of the economy has brought a sharp run-up in inflation.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20210827a.htm
2021-08-27,Monetary Policy in the Time of COVID,"Over the 12 months through July, measures of headline and core personal consumption expenditures inflation have run at 4.2 percent and 3.6 percent, respectively—well above our 2 percent longer-run objective.7Businesses and consumers widely report upward pressure on prices and wages.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20210827a.htm
2021-08-27,Monetary Policy in the Time of COVID,"Inflation at these levels is, of course, a cause for concern.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20210827a.htm
2021-08-27,Monetary Policy in the Time of COVID,But that concern is tempered by a number of factors that suggest that these elevated readings are likely to prove temporary.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20210827a.htm
2021-08-27,Monetary Policy in the Time of COVID,"This assessment is a critical and ongoing one, and we are carefully monitoring incoming data.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20210827a.htm
2021-08-27,Monetary Policy in the Time of COVID,"The dynamics of inflation are complex, and we assess the inflation outlook from a number of different perspectives, as I will now discuss.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20210827a.htm
2021-08-27,Monetary Policy in the Time of COVID,The absence so far of broad-based inflation pressuresThe spike in inflation is so far largely the product of a relatively narrow group of goods and services that have been directly affected by the pandemic and the reopening of the economy.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20210827a.htm
2021-08-27,Monetary Policy in the Time of COVID,Durable goods alone contributed about 1 percentage point to the latest 12‑month measures of headline and core inflation.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20210827a.htm
2021-08-27,Monetary Policy in the Time of COVID,"Energy prices, which rebounded with the strong recovery, added another 0.8 percentage point to headline inflation, and from long experience we expect the inflation effects of these increases to be transitory.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20210827a.htm
2021-08-27,Monetary Policy in the Time of COVID,"In addition, some prices—for example, for hotel rooms and airplane tickets—declined sharply during the recession and have now moved back up close to pre-pandemic levels.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20210827a.htm
2021-08-27,Monetary Policy in the Time of COVID,"The 12-month window we use in computing inflation now captures the rebound in prices but not the initial decline, temporarily elevating reported inflation.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20210827a.htm
2021-08-27,Monetary Policy in the Time of COVID,"These effects, which are adding a few tenths to measured inflation, should wash out over time.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20210827a.htm
2021-08-27,Monetary Policy in the Time of COVID,We consult a range of measures meant to capture whether price increases for particular items are spilling over into broad-based inflation.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20210827a.htm
2021-08-27,Monetary Policy in the Time of COVID,These include trimmed mean measures and measures excluding durables and computed from just before the pandemic.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20210827a.htm
2021-08-27,Monetary Policy in the Time of COVID,These measures generally show inflation at or close to our 2 percent longer-run objective (figure 3).,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20210827a.htm
2021-08-27,Monetary Policy in the Time of COVID,We would be concerned at signs that inflationary pressures were spreading more broadly through the economy.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20210827a.htm
2021-08-27,Monetary Policy in the Time of COVID,"Moderating inflation in higher-inflation itemsWe are also directly monitoring the prices of particular goods and services most affected by the pandemic and the reopening, and are beginning to see a moderation in some cases as shortages ease.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20210827a.htm
2021-08-27,Monetary Policy in the Time of COVID,"Used car prices, for example, appear to have stabilized; indeed, some price indicators are beginning to fall.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20210827a.htm
2021-08-27,Monetary Policy in the Time of COVID,"If that continues, as many analysts predict, then used car prices will soon be pulling measured inflation down, as they did for much of the past decade.8",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20210827a.htm
2021-08-27,Monetary Policy in the Time of COVID,"This same dynamic of upward inflation pressure dissipating and, in some cases, reversing seems likely to play out in durables more generally.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20210827a.htm
2021-08-27,Monetary Policy in the Time of COVID,"Over the 25 years preceding the pandemic, durables prices actually declined, with inflation averaging negative 1.9 percent per year (figure 5).9As supply problems have begun to resolve, inflation in durable goods other than autos has now slowed and may be starting to fall.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20210827a.htm
2021-08-27,Monetary Policy in the Time of COVID,It seems unlikely that durables inflation will continue to contribute importantly over time to overall inflation.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20210827a.htm
2021-08-27,Monetary Policy in the Time of COVID,We will be looking for evidence that supports or undercuts that expectation.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20210827a.htm
2021-08-27,Monetary Policy in the Time of COVID,WagesWe also assess whether wage increases are consistent with 2 percent inflation over time.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20210827a.htm
2021-08-27,Monetary Policy in the Time of COVID,"Wage increases are essential to support a rising standard of living and are generally, of course, a welcome development.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20210827a.htm
2021-08-27,Monetary Policy in the Time of COVID,"But if wage increases were to move materially and persistently above the levels of productivity gains and inflation, businesses would likely pass those increases on to customers, a process that could become the sort of ""wage–price spiral"" seen at times in the past.10Today we see little evidence of wage increases that might threaten excessive inflation (figure 6).",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20210827a.htm
2021-08-27,Monetary Policy in the Time of COVID,"Broad-based measures of wages that adjust for compositional changes in the labor force, such as the employment cost index and the Atlanta Wage Growth Tracker, show wages moving up at a pace that appears consistent with our longer-term inflation objective.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20210827a.htm
2021-08-27,Monetary Policy in the Time of COVID,We will continue to monitor this carefully.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20210827a.htm
2021-08-27,Monetary Policy in the Time of COVID,"Longer-term inflation expectationsPolicymakers and analysts generally believe that, as long as longer-term inflation expectations remain anchored, policy can and should look through temporary swings in inflation.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20210827a.htm
2021-08-27,Monetary Policy in the Time of COVID,Our monetary policy framework emphasizes that anchoring longer-term expectations at 2 percent is important for both maximum employment and price stability.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20210827a.htm
2021-08-27,Monetary Policy in the Time of COVID,We carefully monitor a wide range of indicators of longer-term inflation expectations.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20210827a.htm
2021-08-27,Monetary Policy in the Time of COVID,These measures today are at levels broadly consistent with our 2 percent objective (figure 4).,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20210827a.htm
2021-08-27,Monetary Policy in the Time of COVID,"Because measures of inflation expectations are individually noisy, we also focus on common patterns across the measures.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20210827a.htm
2021-08-27,Monetary Policy in the Time of COVID,"One approach to summarizing these patterns is the Board staff's index of common inflation expectations (CIE), which combines information from a broad range of survey and market-based measures.11This index captures a general move down in expectations starting around 2014, a time when inflation was running persistently below 2 percent.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20210827a.htm
2021-08-27,Monetary Policy in the Time of COVID,"More recently, the index shows a welcome reversal of that decline and is now at levels more consistent with our 2 percent objective.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20210827a.htm
2021-08-27,Monetary Policy in the Time of COVID,"Longer-term inflation expectations have moved much less than actual inflation or near-term expectations, suggesting that households, businesses, and market participants also believe that current high inflation readings are likely to prove transitory and that, in any case, the Fed will keep inflation close to our 2 percent objective over time.12",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20210827a.htm
2021-08-27,Monetary Policy in the Time of COVID,"The prevalence of global disinflationary forces over the past quarter centuryFinally, it is worth noting that, since the 1990s, inflation in many advanced economies has run somewhat below 2 percent even in good times (figure 7).",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20210827a.htm
2021-08-27,Monetary Policy in the Time of COVID,"The pattern of low inflation likely reflects sustained disinflationary forces, including technology, globalization and perhaps demographic factors, as well as a stronger and more successful commitment by central banks to maintain price stability.13In the United States, unemployment ran below 4 percent for about two years before the pandemic, while inflation ran at or below 2 percent.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20210827a.htm
2021-08-27,Monetary Policy in the Time of COVID,Wages did move up across the income spectrum—a welcome development—but not by enough to lift price inflation consistently to 2 percent.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20210827a.htm
2021-08-27,Monetary Policy in the Time of COVID,"While the underlying global disinflationary factors are likely to evolve over time, there is little reason to think that they have suddenly reversed or abated.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20210827a.htm
2021-08-27,Monetary Policy in the Time of COVID,It seems more likely that they will continue to weigh on inflation as the pandemic passes into history.14,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20210827a.htm
2021-08-27,Monetary Policy in the Time of COVID,We will continue to monitor incoming inflation data against each of these assessments.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20210827a.htm
2021-08-27,Monetary Policy in the Time of COVID,"To sum up, the baseline outlook is for continued progress toward maximum employment, with inflation returning to levels consistent with our goal of inflation averaging 2 percent over time.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20210827a.htm
2021-08-27,Monetary Policy in the Time of COVID,Let me now turn to how the baseline outlook and the associated risks and uncertainties figure in our monetary policymaking.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20210827a.htm
2021-08-27,Monetary Policy in the Time of COVID,Implications for Monetary PolicyThe period from 1950 through the early 1980s provides two important lessons for managing the risks and uncertainties we face today.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20210827a.htm
2021-08-27,Monetary Policy in the Time of COVID,"The early days of stabilization policy in the 1950s taught monetary policymakers not to attempt to offset what are likely to be temporary fluctuations in inflation.15Indeed, responding may do more harm than good, particularly in an era where policy rates are much closer to the effective lower bound even in good times.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20210827a.htm
2021-08-27,Monetary Policy in the Time of COVID,The main influence of monetary policy on inflation can come after a lag of a year or more.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20210827a.htm

2021-08-27,Monetary Policy in the Time of COVID,The ill-timed policy move unnecessarily slows hiring and other economic activity and pushes inflation lower than desired.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20210827a.htm
2021-08-27,Monetary Policy in the Time of COVID,"Today, with substantial slack remaining in the labor market and the pandemic continuing, such a mistake could be particularly harmful.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20210827a.htm
2021-08-27,Monetary Policy in the Time of COVID,We know that extended periods of unemployment can mean lasting harm to workers and to the productive capacity of the economy.16,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20210827a.htm
2021-08-27,Monetary Policy in the Time of COVID,"History also teaches, however, that central banks cannot take for granted that inflation due to transitory factors will fade.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20210827a.htm
2021-08-27,Monetary Policy in the Time of COVID,"The 1970s saw two periods in which there were large increases in energy and food prices, raising headline inflation for a time.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20210827a.htm
2021-08-27,Monetary Policy in the Time of COVID,"But when the direct effects on headline inflation eased, core inflation continued to run persistently higher than before.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20210827a.htm
2021-08-27,Monetary Policy in the Time of COVID,One likely contributing factor was that the public had come to generally expect higher inflation—one reason why we now monitor inflation expectations so carefully.17,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20210827a.htm
2021-08-27,Monetary Policy in the Time of COVID,"Central banks have always faced the problem of distinguishing transitory inflation spikes from more troublesome developments, and it is sometimes difficult to do so with confidence in real time.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20210827a.htm

2021-08-27,Monetary Policy in the Time of COVID,"If sustained higher inflation were to become a serious concern, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) would certainly respond and use our tools to assure that inflation runs at levels that are consistent with our goal.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20210827a.htm
2021-08-27,Monetary Policy in the Time of COVID,"Incoming data should provide more evidence that some of the supply–demand imbalances are improving, and more evidence of a continued moderation in inflation, particularly in goods and services prices that have been most affected by the pandemic.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20210827a.htm

2021-02-10,Getting Back to a Strong Labor Market,"In fact, in 2015, prime-age labor force participation—which I focus on because it is not significantly affected by the aging of the population—reached its lowest level in 30 years even as the unemployment rate declined to a relatively low 5 percent.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20210210a.htm

2021-02-10,Getting Back to a Strong Labor Market,"But that disparity too began to shrink; as the expansion continued beyond 2015, Black unemployment reached a historic low of 5.2 percent, and the gap between Black and white unemployment rates was the narrowest since 1972, when data on unemployment by race started to be collected.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20210210a.htm
2021-02-10,Getting Back to a Strong Labor Market,"Black unemployment has tended to rise more than overall unemployment in recessions but also to fall more quickly in expansions.4Over the course of a long expansion, these persistent disparities can decline significantly, but, without policies to address their underlying causes, they may increase again when the economy ultimately turns down.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20210210a.htm
2021-02-10,Getting Back to a Strong Labor Market,"These late-breaking improvements in the labor market did not result in unwanted upward pressures on inflation, as might have been expected; in fact, inflation did not even rise to 2 percent on a sustained basis.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20210210a.htm

2021-02-10,Getting Back to a Strong Labor Market,Correcting this misclassification and counting those who have left the labor force since last February as unemployed would boost the unemployment rate to close to 10 percent in January (figure 6).,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20210210a.htm

2021-02-10,Getting Back to a Strong Labor Market,"At the start of the pandemic, the increase in unemployment was almost entirely due to temporary job losses.7Temporarily laid-off workers tend to return to work much more quickly, on average, than those whose ties to their former employers are permanently severed.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20210210a.htm

2021-02-10,Getting Back to a Strong Labor Market,"In addition, we have seen that the longer-run potential growth rate of the economy appears to be lower than it once was, in part because of population aging, and that the neutral rate of interest—or the rate consistent with the economy being at full employment with 2 percent inflation—is also much lower than before.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20210210a.htm
2021-02-10,Getting Back to a Strong Labor Market,A low neutral rate means that our policy rate will be constrained more often by the effective lower bound.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20210210a.htm

2021-02-10,Getting Back to a Strong Labor Market,"To take these economic developments into account, we made substantial revisions to our monetary policy framework, as described in the FOMC's Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy.11This revised statement shares many features with its predecessor, including our view that longer-run inflation of 2 percent is most consistent with our mandate to promote maximum employment and price stability.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20210210a.htm

2021-02-10,Getting Back to a Strong Labor Market,"Recognizing the economy's ability to sustain a robust job market without causing an unwanted increase in inflation, the statement says that our policy decisions will be informed by our ""assessments of theshortfallsof employment from its maximum level"" rather than by ""deviationsfrom its maximum level.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20210210a.htm

2021-02-10,Getting Back to a Strong Labor Market,"This means that following periods when inflation has been running persistently below 2 percent, appropriate monetary policy will likely aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time in the service of keeping inflation expectations well anchored at our 2 percent longer-run goal.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20210210a.htm
2021-02-10,Getting Back to a Strong Labor Market,"Our January postmeeting statement on monetary policy implements this new framework.13In particular, we expect that it will be appropriate to maintain the current accommodative target range of the federal funds rate until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20210210a.htm

2022-11-30,Inflation and the Labor Market,"Several factors contributed to this slowing growth, including the waning effects of reopening and of pandemic fiscal support, the global implications of Russia's war against Ukraine, and our policy actions, which tightened financial conditions and are affecting economic activity, particularly in interest-sensitive sectors such as housing.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20221130a.htm

2022-11-30,Inflation and the Labor Market,"Housing inflation tends to lag other prices around inflation turning points, however, because of the slow rate at which the stock of rental leases turns over.2The market rate on new leases is a timelier indicator of where overall housing inflation will go over the next year or so.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20221130a.htm
2022-11-30,Inflation and the Labor Market,Measures of 12-month inflation in new leases rose to nearly 20 percent during the pandemic but have been falling sharply since about midyear (figure 3).,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20221130a.htm
2022-11-30,Inflation and the Labor Market,"As figure 3 shows, however, overall housing services inflation has continued to rise as existing leases turn over and jump in price to catch up with the higher level of rents for new leases.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20221130a.htm
2022-11-30,Inflation and the Labor Market,This is likely to continue well into next year.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20221130a.htm

2022-11-30,Inflation and the Labor Market,"In the labor market, demand for workers far exceeds the supply of available workers, and nominal wages have been growing at a pace well above what would be consistent with 2 percent inflation over time.3Thus, another condition we are looking for is the restoration of balance between supply and demand in the labor market.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20221130a.htm

2022-11-30,Inflation and the Labor Market,"Comparing the current labor force with the Congressional Budget Office's pre-pandemic forecast of labor force growth reveals a current labor force shortfall of roughly 3-1/2 million people (figure 4, left panel).4This shortfall reflects both lower-than-expected population growth and a lower labor force participation rate (figure 4, right panel).",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20221130a.htm

2022-11-30,Inflation and the Labor Market,"Some of the participation gap reflects workers who are still out of the labor force because they are sick with COVID-19 or continue to suffer lingering symptoms from previous COVID infections (""long COVID"").5But recent research by Fed economists finds that the participation gap is now mostly due to excess retirements—that is, retirements in excess of what would have been expected from population aging alone.6These excess retirements might now account for more than 2 million of the 3‑1/2 million shortfall in the labor force.7",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20221130a.htm
2022-11-30,Inflation and the Labor Market,What explains these excess retirements?,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20221130a.htm
2022-11-30,Inflation and the Labor Market,"Health issues have surely played a role, as COVID has posed a particularly large threat to the lives and health of the elderly.8In addition, many older workers lost their jobs in the early stages of the pandemic, when layoffs were historically high.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20221130a.htm
2022-11-30,Inflation and the Labor Market,"The cost of finding new employment may have appeared particularly large for these workers, given pandemic-related disruptions to the work environment and health concerns.9Also, gains in the stock market and rising house prices in the first two years of the pandemic contributed to an increase in wealth that likely facilitated early retirement for some people.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20221130a.htm
2022-11-30,Inflation and the Labor Market,The data so far do not suggest that excess retirements are likely to unwind because of retirees returning to the labor force.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20221130a.htm
2022-11-30,Inflation and the Labor Market,"Older workers are still retiring at higher rates, and retirees do not appear to be returning to the labor force in sufficient numbers to meaningfully reduce the total number of excess retirees.10",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20221130a.htm
2022-11-30,Inflation and the Labor Market,The second factor contributing to the labor supply shortfall is slower growth in the working-age population.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20221130a.htm
2022-11-30,Inflation and the Labor Market,The combination of a plunge in net immigration and a surge in deaths during the pandemic probably accounts for about 1-1/2 million missing workers.11,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20221130a.htm
2022-11-30,Inflation and the Labor Market,Policies to support labor supply are not the domain of the Fed: Our tools work principally on demand.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20221130a.htm

2022-11-30,Inflation and the Labor Market,"Such policies would take time to implement and have their effects, however.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20221130a.htm

2022-11-30,Inflation and the Labor Market,"Currently, the unemployment rate is at 3.7 percent, near 50-year lows, and job openings exceed available workers by about 4 million—that is about 1.7 job openings for every person looking for work (figure 5).",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20221130a.htm

2022-11-30,Inflation and the Labor Market,Some measures of wage growth have ticked down recently (figure 6).,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20221130a.htm
2022-11-30,Inflation and the Labor Market,But the declines are very modest so far relative to earlier increases and still leave wage growth well above levels consistent with 2 percent inflation over time.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20221130a.htm

2022-08-26,Monetary Policy and Price Stability,"In particular, we are drawing on three important lessons.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20220826a.htm
2022-08-26,Monetary Policy and Price Stability,The first lesson is that central bankscanandshouldtake responsibility for delivering low and stable inflation.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20220826a.htm
2022-08-26,Monetary Policy and Price Stability,"It may seem strange now that central bankers and others once needed convincing on these two fronts, but as former Chairman Ben Bernanke has shown, both propositions were widely questioned during the Great Inflation period.1Today, we regard these questions as settled.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20220826a.htm
2022-08-26,Monetary Policy and Price Stability,Our responsibility to deliver price stability is unconditional.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20220826a.htm
2022-08-26,Monetary Policy and Price Stability,"It is true that the current high inflation is a global phenomenon, and that many economies around the world face inflation as high or higher than seen here in the United States.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20220826a.htm
2022-08-26,Monetary Policy and Price Stability,"It is also true, in my view, that the current high inflation in the United States is the product of strong demand and constrained supply, and that the Fed's tools work principally on aggregate demand.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20220826a.htm
2022-08-26,Monetary Policy and Price Stability,None of this diminishes the Federal Reserve's responsibility to carry out our assigned task of achieving price stability.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20220826a.htm
2022-08-26,Monetary Policy and Price Stability,There is clearly a job to do in moderating demand to better align with supply.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20220826a.htm
2022-08-26,Monetary Policy and Price Stability,We are committed to doing that job.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20220826a.htm
2022-08-26,Monetary Policy and Price Stability,The second lesson is that the public's expectations about future inflation can play an important role in setting the path of inflation over time.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20220826a.htm
2022-08-26,Monetary Policy and Price Stability,"Today, by many measures, longer-term inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20220826a.htm
2022-08-26,Monetary Policy and Price Stability,"That is broadly true of surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters, and of market-based measures as well.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20220826a.htm
2022-08-26,Monetary Policy and Price Stability,"But that is not grounds for complacency, with inflation having run well above our goal for some time.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20220826a.htm
2022-08-26,Monetary Policy and Price Stability,"If the public expects that inflation will remain low and stable over time, then, absent major shocks, it likely will.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20220826a.htm
2022-08-26,Monetary Policy and Price Stability,"Unfortunately, the same is true of expectations of high and volatile inflation.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20220826a.htm
2022-08-26,Monetary Policy and Price Stability,"During the 1970s, as inflation climbed, the anticipation of high inflation became entrenched in the economic decisionmaking of households and businesses.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20220826a.htm
2022-08-26,Monetary Policy and Price Stability,"The more inflation rose, the more people came to expect it to remain high, and they built that belief into wage and pricing decisions.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20220826a.htm
2022-08-26,Monetary Policy and Price Stability,"As former Chairman Paul Volcker put it at the height of the Great Inflation in 1979, ""Inflation feeds in part on itself, so part of the job of returning to a more stable and more productive economy must be to break the grip of inflationary expectations.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20220826a.htm
2022-08-26,Monetary Policy and Price Stability,"One useful insight into how actual inflation may affect expectations about its future path is based in the concept of ""rational inattention.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20220826a.htm
2022-08-26,Monetary Policy and Price Stability,"""3When inflation is persistently high, households and businesses must pay close attention and incorporate inflation into their economic decisions.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20220826a.htm
2022-08-26,Monetary Policy and Price Stability,"When inflation is low and stable, they are freer to focus their attention elsewhere.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20220826a.htm
2022-08-26,Monetary Policy and Price Stability,"Former Chairman Alan Greenspan put it this way: ""For all practical purposes, price stability means that expected changes in the average price level are small enough and gradual enough that they do not materially enter business and household financial decisions.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20220826a.htm
2022-08-26,Monetary Policy and Price Stability,"Of course, inflation has just about everyone's attention right now, which highlights a particular risk today: The longer the current bout of high inflation continues, the greater the chance that expectations of higher inflation will become entrenched.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20220826a.htm
2022-08-26,Monetary Policy and Price Stability,"That brings me to the third lesson, which is that we must keep at it until the job is done.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20220826a.htm
2022-08-26,Monetary Policy and Price Stability,"History shows that the employment costs of bringing down inflation are likely to increase with delay, as high inflation becomes more entrenched in wage and price setting.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20220826a.htm
2022-08-26,Monetary Policy and Price Stability,The successful Volcker disinflation in the early 1980s followed multiple failed attempts to lower inflation over the previous 15 years.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20220826a.htm

2022-03-21,Restoring Price Stability,The rise in inflation has been much greater and more persistent than forecasters generally expected.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20220321a.htm
2022-03-21,Restoring Price Stability,"For example, at the time of our June 2021 meeting, every Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) participant and all but one of 35 submissions in the Survey of Professional Forecasters predicted that 2021 inflation would be below 4 percent.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20220321a.htm
2022-03-21,Restoring Price Stability,Inflation came in at 5.5 percent.2,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20220321a.htm
2022-03-21,Restoring Price Stability,"For a time, moderate inflation forecasts looked plausible—the one-month headline and core inflation rates declined steadily from April through September.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20220321a.htm
2022-03-21,Restoring Price Stability,"But inflation moved up sharply in the fall, and, just since our December meeting, the median FOMC projection for year-end 2022 jumped from 2.6 percent to 4.3 percent.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20220321a.htm
2022-03-21,Restoring Price Stability,Why have forecasts been so far off?,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20220321a.htm
2022-03-21,Restoring Price Stability,"In my view, an important part of the explanation is that forecasters widely underestimated the severity and persistence of supply-side frictions, which, when combined with strong demand, especially for durable goods, produced surprisingly high inflation.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20220321a.htm
2022-03-21,Restoring Price Stability,"The pandemic and the associated shutdown and reopening of the economy caused a serious upheaval in many parts of the economy, snarling supply chains, constraining labor supply, and creating a major boom in demand for goods and a bust in services demand.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20220321a.htm
2022-03-21,Restoring Price Stability,The combination of the surge in goods demand with supply chain bottlenecks led to sharply rising goods prices (figure 4).,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20220321a.htm
2022-03-21,Restoring Price Stability,The most notable example here is motor vehicles.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20220321a.htm
2022-03-21,Restoring Price Stability,"Prices soared across the vehicles sector as booming demand was met by a sharpdeclinein global production during the summer of 2021, owing to shortages of computer chips.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20220321a.htm
2022-03-21,Restoring Price Stability,"Production remains below pre-pandemic levels, and an expected sharp decline in prices has been repeatedly postponed.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20220321a.htm
2022-03-21,Restoring Price Stability,"Many forecasters, including FOMC participants, had been expecting inflation to cool in the second half of last year, as the economy started going back to normal after vaccines became widely available.3Expectations were that the supply-side damage would begin to heal.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20220321a.htm
2022-03-21,Restoring Price Stability,"Schools would reopen—freeing parents to return to work—and labor supply would begin bouncing back, kinks in supply chains would begin resolving, and consumption would start rotating back to services, all of which could reduce price pressures.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20220321a.htm
2022-03-21,Restoring Price Stability,"While schools are open, none of the other expectations has been fully met.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20220321a.htm
2022-03-21,Restoring Price Stability,"Part of the reason may be that, contrary to expectations, COVID has not gone away with the arrival of vaccines.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20220321a.htm
2022-03-21,Restoring Price Stability,"In fact, we are now headed once again into more COVID-related supply disruptions from China.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20220321a.htm
2022-03-21,Restoring Price Stability,"It continues to seem likely that hoped-for supply-side healing will come over time as the world ultimately settles into some new normal, but the timing and scope of that relief are highly uncertain.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20220321a.htm
2022-03-21,Restoring Price Stability,"In the meantime, as we set policy, we will be looking to actual progress on these issues and not assuming significant near-term supply-side relief.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20220321a.htm
2022-03-21,Restoring Price Stability,"The Policy ResponseAs the magnitude and persistence of the increase in inflation became increasingly clear over the second half of last year, and as the job market recovery accelerated beyond expectations, the FOMC pivoted to progressively less accommodative monetary policy.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20220321a.htm
2022-03-21,Restoring Price Stability,"In June, the median FOMC participant projected that the federal funds rate would remain at its effective lower bound through the end of 2022, and as the news came in, the projected policy paths shifted higher (figure 5).",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20220321a.htm
2022-03-21,Restoring Price Stability,The median projection that accompanied last week's 25 basis point rate increase shows the federal funds rate at 1.9 percent by the end of this year and rising above its estimated longer-run normal value in 2023.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20220321a.htm
2022-03-21,Restoring Price Stability,The latest FOMC statement also indicates that the Committee expects to begin reducing the size of our balance sheet at a coming meeting.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20220321a.htm
2022-03-21,Restoring Price Stability,I believe that these policy actions and those to come will help bring inflation down near 2 percent over the next 3 years.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20220321a.htm
2022-03-21,Restoring Price Stability,"As always, our policy projections are not a Committee decision or fixed plan.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20220321a.htm
2022-03-21,Restoring Price Stability,"Instead, they are a summary of what the FOMC participants see as the most likely case going forward.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20220321a.htm
2022-03-21,Restoring Price Stability,"The events of the past four weeks remind us that, in tumultuous times, what seems like the most likely scenario may change quite quickly: Each Summary of Economic Projections reflects a point in time and can become outdated quickly at times like these, when events are developing rapidly.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20220321a.htm
2022-03-21,Restoring Price Stability,"Thus, my main message today is that, as the outlook evolves, we will adjust policy as needed in order to ensure a return to price stability with a strong job market.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20220321a.htm
2022-03-21,Restoring Price Stability,Let me now turn to three questions about the likely evolution of policy.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20220321a.htm
2022-03-21,Restoring Price Stability,How will fallout from the invasion of Ukraine affect the economy and monetary policy?Russia's invasion of Ukraine may have significant effects on the world economy and the U.S. economy.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20220321a.htm
2022-03-21,Restoring Price Stability,The magnitude and persistence of these effects remain highly uncertain and depend on events yet to come.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20220321a.htm
2022-03-21,Restoring Price Stability,"Russia is one of the world's largest producers of commodities, and Ukraine is a key producer of several commodities as well, including wheat and neon, which is used in the production of computer chips.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20220321a.htm
2022-03-21,Restoring Price Stability,There is no recent experience with significant market disruption across such a broad range of commodities.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20220321a.htm
2022-03-21,Restoring Price Stability,"In addition to the direct effects from higher global oil and commodity prices, the invasion and related events are likely to restrain economic activity abroad and further disrupt supply chains, which would create spillovers to the U.S. economy.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20220321a.htm
2022-03-21,Restoring Price Stability,We might look to the historical experience with oil price shocks in the 1970s—not a happy story.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20220321a.htm
2022-03-21,Restoring Price Stability,"Fortunately, the United States is now much better situated to weather oil price shocks.4We are now the world's largest producer of oil, and our economy is significantly less oil intensive than in the 1970s.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20220321a.htm
2022-03-21,Restoring Price Stability,"Today a rise in oil prices has mixed effects on the economy, lowering real household incomes and thus demand, but raising investment in drilling over time and benefiting oil-producing areas more generally.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20220321a.htm
2022-03-21,Restoring Price Stability,"On net, oil shocks tend to weigh on output in the U.S. economy, but by far less than in the 1970s.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20220321a.htm
2022-03-21,Restoring Price Stability,"Second, how likely is it that monetary policy can lower inflation without causing a recession?Our goal is to restore price stability while fostering another long expansion and sustaining a strong labor market.In the FOMC participant projections I just described, the economy achieves a soft landing, with inflation coming down and unemployment holding steady.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20220321a.htm
2022-03-21,Restoring Price Stability,"Growth slows as the very fast growth from the early stages of reopening fades, the effects of fiscal support wane, and monetary policy accommodation is removed.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20220321a.htm
2022-03-21,Restoring Price Stability,"Some have argued that history stacks the odds against achieving a soft landing, and point to the 1994 episode as the only successful soft landing in the postwar period.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20220321a.htm
2022-03-21,Restoring Price Stability,"I believe that the historical record provides some grounds for optimism: Soft, or at least soft-ish, landings have been relatively common in U.S. monetary history.5In three episodes—in 1965, 1984, and 1994—the Fed raised the federal funds rate significantly in response to perceived overheating without precipitating a recession (figure 6).6In other cases, recessions chronologically followed the conclusion of a tightening cycle, but the recessions were not apparently due to excessive tightening of monetary policy.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20220321a.htm
2022-03-21,Restoring Price Stability,"For example, the tightening from 2015 to 2019 was followed by the pandemic-induced recession.7",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20220321a.htm
2022-03-21,Restoring Price Stability,I hasten to add that no one expects that bringing about a soft landing will be straightforward in the current context—very little is straightforward in the current context.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20220321a.htm
2022-03-21,Restoring Price Stability,"And monetary policy is often said to be a blunt instrument, not capable of surgical precision.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20220321a.htm
2022-03-21,Restoring Price Stability,My colleagues and I will do our very best to succeed in this challenging task.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20220321a.htm
2022-03-21,Restoring Price Stability,It is worth noting that today the economy is very strong and is well positioned to handle tighter monetary policy.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20220321a.htm
2022-03-21,Restoring Price Stability,"Finally, what will it take to restore price stability?The ultimate responsibility for price stability rests with the Federal Reserve.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20220321a.htm

2022-03-21,Restoring Price Stability,I believe that the policy approach that I have laid out is well suited to achieving this outcome.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20220321a.htm
2022-03-21,Restoring Price Stability,We will take the necessary steps to ensure a return to price stability.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20220321a.htm
2022-03-21,Restoring Price Stability,"In particular, if we conclude that it is appropriate to move more aggressively by raising the federal funds rate by more than 25 basis points at a meeting or meetings, we will do so.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20220321a.htm
2022-03-21,Restoring Price Stability,"And if we determine that we need to tighten beyond common measures of neutral and into a more restrictive stance, we will do that as well.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20220321a.htm
2022-03-21,Restoring Price Stability,"Our monetary policy framework, as embodied in our Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, emphasizes that having longer-term inflation expectations anchored at our longer-run objective of 2 percent helps us achieve both our dual-mandate objectives.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20220321a.htm
2022-03-21,Restoring Price Stability,"While we cannot measure longer-term expectations directly, we monitor a variety of survey- and market-based indicators.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20220321a.htm
2022-03-21,Restoring Price Stability,"In the recent period, short-term inflation expectations have, of course, risen with inflation, but longer-run expectations remain well anchored in their historical ranges (figure 7).",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20220321a.htm
2022-03-21,Restoring Price Stability,"The added near-term upward pressure from the invasion of Ukraine on inflation from energy, food, and other commodities comes at a time of already too high inflation.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20220321a.htm
2022-03-21,Restoring Price Stability,"In normal times, when employment and inflation are close to our objectives, monetary policy would look through a brief burst of inflation associated with commodity price shocks.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20220321a.htm
2022-03-21,Restoring Price Stability,"However, the risk is rising that an extended period of high inflation could push longer-term expectations uncomfortably higher, which underscores the need for the Committee to move expeditiously as I have described.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20220321a.htm
2022-03-21,Restoring Price Stability,ConclusionThe past two years have been extraordinarily challenging for many Americans.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20220321a.htm

2023-12-01,Opening Remarks,"Governor Cook's research highlights the key role of such education in preparing individuals to be inventors and innovators who can generate ideas that will add to our body of knowledge, increase productivity, and generate higher living standards.1Her work is just one example of how Spelman women continue to make historic contributions in science, the arts, technology, medicine, and other fields.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20231201a.htm
2023-12-01,Opening Remarks,"I look forward to our conversation, and I thought I might frame it by talking about the Federal Reserve's actions to promote a healthy economy, and how those actions relate to questions students in this audience may be asking about the future.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20231201a.htm
2023-12-01,Opening Remarks,"For example, I am sure that students are wondering what kind of a job market and economy you will be entering when you complete your education.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20231201a.htm

2023-12-01,Opening Remarks,That gradual slowing has come in part due to the efforts of the Fed to slow the growth of the economy to help reduce inflation.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20231201a.htm
2023-12-01,Opening Remarks,"After declining sharply during the pandemic, the supply of workers has bounced back, as people have come back into the labor force and as immigration has returned to pre-pandemic levels.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20231201a.htm
2023-12-01,Opening Remarks,"Partly because of that labor force growth, the unemployment rate has edged up over the second half of the year, though it remains historically low at 3.9 percent.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20231201a.htm

2023-12-01,Opening Remarks,"As for price stability, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has a longer-run goal of 2 percent inflation.2After running below 2 percent for over a decade, inflation increased sharply in 2021, in the United States and in many other countries around the world.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20231201a.htm

2023-12-01,Opening Remarks,"Inflation has declined to 3 percent over the 12 months ending in October, but after factoring out energy and food prices, which tend to be volatile, what we call ""core"" inflation is still 3.5 percent, well above our 2 percent objective.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20231201a.htm
2023-12-01,Opening Remarks,"Over the six months ending in October, core inflation ran at an annual rate of 2.5 percent, and while the lower inflation readings of the past few months are welcome, that progress must continue if we are to reach our 2 percent objective.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20231201a.htm

2023-12-01,Opening Remarks,"The normalization of supply and demand conditions has played a critical role in the disinflation so far, as has the substantial tightening of monetary policy and overall financial conditions over the past two years.3The strong actions we have taken have moved our policy rate well into restrictive territory, meaning that tight monetary policy is putting downward pressure on economic activity and inflation.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20231201a.htm
2023-12-01,Opening Remarks,"Monetary policy is thought to affect economic conditions with a lag, and the full effects of our tightening have likely not yet been felt.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20231201a.htm
2023-12-01,Opening Remarks,"The forcefulness of our response to inflation also helped maintain the Fed's hard-won credibility, ensuring that the public's expectations of future inflation remain well-anchored.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20231201a.htm

2023-12-01,Opening Remarks,"Like most forecasters, my colleagues and I anticipate that growth in spending and output will slow over the next year, as the effects of the pandemic and the reopening fade and as restrictive monetary policy weighs on aggregate demand.5The FOMC is strongly committed to bringing inflation down to 2 percent over time, and to keeping policy restrictive until we are confident that inflation is on a path to that objective.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20231201a.htm
2023-12-01,Opening Remarks,"It would be premature to conclude with confidence that we have achieved a sufficiently restrictive stance, or to speculate on when policy might ease.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20231201a.htm

2023-12-01,Opening Remarks,"The bottom line, if you are a student, is that we have made considerable progress in reducing high inflation while maintaining a strong labor market, with a lot of opportunity for new graduates.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20231201a.htm
2023-12-01,Opening Remarks,"The unemployment rate has risen a bit, but it is still very low by historical standards, and by many measures it is a great time to start your career.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20231201a.htm

2023-12-01,Opening Remarks,"With that, I will hand it back to you, President Gayle.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20231201a.htm
2023-11-09,Opening Remarks,Thank you for the opportunity to participate in today's panel discussion.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20231109a.htm
2023-11-09,Opening Remarks,My assigned topic is U.S. monetary policy in the current global inflation episode.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20231109a.htm
2023-11-09,Opening Remarks,I will briefly address the U.S. outlook and then turn to three broader questions raised by the historic events of the pandemic era.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20231109a.htm
2023-11-09,Opening Remarks,U.S. inflation has come down over the past year but remains well above our 2 percent target (figure 1).1My colleagues and I are gratified by this progress but expect that the process of getting inflation sustainably down to 2 percent has a long way to go.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20231109a.htm
2023-11-09,Opening Remarks,"The labor market remains tight, although improvements in labor supply and a gradual easing in demand continue to move it into better balance.2Gross domestic product growth in the third quarter was quite strong, but, like most forecasters, we expect growth to moderate in coming quarters.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20231109a.htm
2023-11-09,Opening Remarks,"Of course, that remains to be seen, and we are attentive to the risk that stronger growth could undermine further progress in restoring balance to the labor market and in bringing inflation down, which could warrant a response from monetary policy.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20231109a.htm
2023-11-09,Opening Remarks,The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is committed to achieving a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation down to 2 percent over time; we are not confident that we have achieved such a stance.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20231109a.htm
2023-11-09,Opening Remarks,We know that ongoing progress toward our 2 percent goal is not assured: Inflation has given us a few head fakes.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20231109a.htm
2023-11-09,Opening Remarks,"If it becomes appropriate to tighten policy further, we will not hesitate to do so.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20231109a.htm
2023-11-09,Opening Remarks,"We will continue to move carefully, however, allowing us to address both the risk of being misled by a few good months of data, and the risk of overtightening.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20231109a.htm
2023-11-09,Opening Remarks,"We are making decisions meeting by meeting, based on the totality of the incoming data and their implications for the outlook for economic activity and inflation, as well as the balance of risks, determining the extent of additional policy firming that may be appropriate to return inflation to 2 percent over time.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20231109a.htm
2023-11-09,Opening Remarks,We will keep at it until the job is done.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20231109a.htm
2023-11-09,Opening Remarks,"With that, I will turn to three questions that have arisen from the receding but still elevated inflation we are experiencing today.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20231109a.htm
2023-11-09,Opening Remarks,"The first question is, with the benefit of 2‑1/2 years to look back, what we can say about the initial causes and ongoing policy implications of the current inflation.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20231109a.htm
2023-11-09,Opening Remarks,"After running below our 2 percent target over the first year of the pandemic, core PCE (personal consumption expenditures) inflation rose sharply in March 2021.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20231109a.htm
2023-11-09,Opening Remarks,"Economic forecasters generally did not see this coming, as shown by the February 2021 Survey of Professional Forecasters, which showed core PCE inflation running at or below target over the subsequent three years.3The real-time questions for policymakers were what caused the high inflation and how policy should react.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20231109a.htm
2023-11-09,Opening Remarks,"At the outset, many forecasters and analysts, including FOMC participants, viewed the sudden upturn in inflation as mostly a function of pandemic-related shifts in the composition of demand, a disruption of supply chains, and a sharp decline in labor supply.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20231109a.htm
2023-11-09,Opening Remarks,"The resulting supply and demand imbalances led to large increases in the prices of a range of items most directly affected by the pandemic, especially goods.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20231109a.htm
2023-11-09,Opening Remarks,"In this view, as the pandemic abated, our dynamic and flexible economy was likely to adapt fairly quickly.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20231109a.htm
2023-11-09,Opening Remarks,Supply disruptions and shortages would diminish.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20231109a.htm
2023-11-09,Opening Remarks,"Labor supply would rebound, aided by the arrival of vaccines and the reopening of schools.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20231109a.htm
2023-11-09,Opening Remarks,Elevated demand for goods would shift back to services.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20231109a.htm
2023-11-09,Opening Remarks,Inflation would ease reasonably quickly without the need for a significant policy response.4,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20231109a.htm
2023-11-09,Opening Remarks,"Indeed, although monthly core PCE inflation spiked in March and April of 2021, beginning in May it declined for five consecutive months, providing some support for this view (figure 2).",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20231109a.htm
2023-11-09,Opening Remarks,"But in the fourth quarter of 2021, the data clearly changed amid waves of new COVID-19 variants, with only gradual progress in restoring global supply chains, and relatively few workers rejoining the labor force.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20231109a.htm
2023-11-09,Opening Remarks,"That lack of progress, combined with very strong demand from households, contributed to a tight economy and a historically tight labor market, and more persistent high inflation.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20231109a.htm
2023-11-09,Opening Remarks,"The Committee signaled a change in our policy approach, and financial conditions began to tighten.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20231109a.htm
2023-11-09,Opening Remarks,"A new shock arrived in February 2022, when Russia invaded Ukraine, resulting in a sharp increase in energy and other commodity prices.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20231109a.htm
2023-11-09,Opening Remarks,"When we lifted off in March, it was clear that bringing down inflation would depend both on the unwinding of the unprecedented pandemic-related demand and supply distortions and on our tightening of monetary policy, which would slow the growth of aggregate demand, allowing supply time to catch up.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20231109a.htm
2023-11-09,Opening Remarks,"Today, these two processes are working together to bring inflation down.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20231109a.htm
2023-11-09,Opening Remarks,The FOMC has raised the federal funds rate target range by 5-1/4 percentage points and reduced our securities holdings by more than $1 trillion.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20231109a.htm
2023-11-09,Opening Remarks,Monetary policy is in restrictive territory and putting downward pressure on demand and inflation.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20231109a.htm
2023-11-09,Opening Remarks,The unwinding of pandemic-related supply and demand distortions is playing an important role in the decline of inflation.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20231109a.htm
2023-11-09,Opening Remarks,"For example, wage growth has steadily fallen by most measures since mid-2022 (figure 3), despite continued robust job gains, reflecting a resurgence in labor supply thanks to higher labor force participation and a return of immigration to pre-pandemic levels.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20231109a.htm
2023-11-09,Opening Remarks,"While the broader supply recovery continues, it is not clear how much more will be achieved by additional supply-side improvements.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20231109a.htm
2023-11-09,Opening Remarks,"Going forward, it may be that a greater share of the progress in reducing inflation will have to come from tight monetary policy restraining the growth of aggregate demand.5",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20231109a.htm
2023-11-09,Opening Remarks,"Turning to my second question, for many years, it has been generally thought that monetary policy should limit its response to, or ""look through,"" supply shocks to the extent that they are temporary and idiosyncratic.6Many argue as well that, in the future, supply disruptions are likely to be more frequent or more persistent than in the decades just before the pandemic.7A second question, then, is what we have learned about the standard ""looking through"" approach.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20231109a.htm
2023-11-09,Opening Remarks,"The idea that the response to the inflationary effects of supply shocks should be attenuated arises, in part, from the tradeoff presented by those shocks.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20231109a.htm
2023-11-09,Opening Remarks,"Supply shocks tend to move prices and employment in opposite directions, whereas monetary policy pushes each in the same direction.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20231109a.htm
2023-11-09,Opening Remarks,"Therefore, the response of monetary policy to higher prices stemming from an adverse supply shock should be attenuated because it would otherwise amplify the unwanted decline in employment.8In addition, supply shocks have most frequently come from the volatile food and energy categories and have passed quickly.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20231109a.htm
2023-11-09,Opening Remarks,"While food and energy prices critically affect the budgets of households and businesses, the policy tools of central banks work more slowly than commodity markets move.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20231109a.htm
2023-11-09,Opening Remarks,Responding aggressively to quickly passing price increases could exacerbate macroeconomic volatility without supporting price stability.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20231109a.htm
2023-11-09,Opening Remarks,Our experience since 2020 highlights some limits of that thinking.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20231109a.htm
2023-11-09,Opening Remarks,"To begin with, it can be challenging to disentangle supply shocks from demand shocks in real time, and also to determine how long either will persist, particularly in the extraordinary circumstances of the past three years.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20231109a.htm
2023-11-09,Opening Remarks,Supply shocks that have a persistent effect on potential output could call for restrictive policy to better align aggregate demand with the suppressed level of aggregate supply.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20231109a.htm
2023-11-09,Opening Remarks,The sequence of shocks to global supply chains experienced from 2020 to 2022 suppressed output for a considerable time and may have persistently altered global supply dynamics.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20231109a.htm
2023-11-09,Opening Remarks,Such a sequence calls on policymakers to use policy restraint to limit inflationary effects.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20231109a.htm
2023-11-09,Opening Remarks,Policy restraint in this case is also good risk management.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20231109a.htm
2023-11-09,Opening Remarks,Supply shocks that drive inflation high enough for long enough can affect the longer-term inflation expectations of households and businesses.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20231109a.htm
2023-11-09,Opening Remarks,"Monetary policy must forthrightly address any risks of a potential de-anchoring of inflation expectations, as well-anchored expectations help facilitate bringing inflation back to our target.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20231109a.htm
2023-11-09,Opening Remarks,The sharp policy tightening during 2022 likely contributed to keeping inflation expectations well anchored.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20231109a.htm
2023-11-09,Opening Remarks,My third question is the level where interest rates will settle once the effects of the pandemic are truly behind us.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20231109a.htm
2023-11-09,Opening Remarks,"By 2019, the general level of nominal interest rates had declined steadily over several decades (figure 4).",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20231109a.htm
2023-11-09,Opening Remarks,"As the pandemic arrived, many advanced economies had below-target inflation and low or mildly negative policy rates, raising difficult questions about the efficacy of interest rate policy when constrained by the effective lower bound (ELB).",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20231109a.htm
2023-11-09,Opening Remarks,"Over two decades, an extensive literature had identified a number of possible changes to the widely used inflation-targeting regime, including negative policy rates, nominal income targeting, and various forms of makeup strategies under which persistent shortfalls in inflation would be followed by a period of inflation running moderately above 2 percent.9Today, inflation and policy rates are elevated, and the ELB is not currently relevant for our policy decisions.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20231109a.htm
2023-11-09,Opening Remarks,But it is too soon to say whether the monetary policy challenges of the ELB will ultimately turn out to be a thing of the past.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20231109a.htm
2023-11-09,Opening Remarks,The prolonged proximity of interest rates to the ELB was at the heart of the monetary policy review and the changes we made to our framework in 2020.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20231109a.htm
2023-11-09,Opening Remarks,We will begin our next five-year review in the latter half of 2024 and announce the results about a year later.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20231109a.htm
2023-11-09,Opening Remarks,Among the questions we will consider is the degree to which the structural features of the economy that led to low interest rates in the pre-pandemic era will persist.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20231109a.htm
2023-11-09,Opening Remarks,"With time, we will continue to learn from the experience of the past few years, and what implications it may hold for monetary policy.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20231109a.htm
2023-11-09,Opening Remarks,"These are just three of the many questions raised by these challenging times, and we are far from a complete understanding of the answers.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20231109a.htm
2023-11-09,Opening Remarks,I appreciate the opportunity to discuss these issues with you today and look forward to our conversation.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20231109a.htm

2023-11-08,Opening Remarks,"Among its other activities, the Board of Governors is one of the world's most productive economic research institutions, and a large share of that work takes place inside R&S, supporting our mission of promoting a healthy economy and a strong and stable financial system.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20231108a.htm
2023-11-08,Opening Remarks,I've spoken about research—now let me turn to statistics.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20231108a.htm

2023-08-25,Inflation:  Progress and the Path Ahead,"By the time the Federal Open Market Committee raised the policy rate in March 2022, it was clear that bringing down inflation would depend on both the unwinding of the unprecedented pandemic-related demand and supply distortions and on our tightening of monetary policy, which would slow the growth of aggregate demand, allowing supply time to catch up.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20230825a.htm

2023-08-25,Inflation:  Progress and the Path Ahead,"To understand the factors that will likely drive further progress, it is useful to separately examine the three broad components of core PCE inflation—inflation for goods, for housing services, and for all other services, sometimes referred to as nonhousing services (figure 2).",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20230825a.htm

2023-08-25,Inflation:  Progress and the Path Ahead,Part of the reason for the modest decline of nonhousing services inflation so far is that many of these services were less affected by global supply chain bottlenecks and are generally thought to be less interest sensitive than other sectors such as housing or durable goods.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20230825a.htm

2023-06-29,Financial Stability and Economic Developments,"Three General Observations Stemming from the Recent Banking TurmoilGiven the efforts to build resilience in the banking system over the past decade and a half, two natural questions are, why did Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and two other sizable U.S. banks fail this spring, and why did Credit Suisse—a global systemically important bank (G-SIB)—require a government-supported rescue acquisition?",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20230629a.htm
2023-06-29,Financial Stability and Economic Developments,We are committed to learning the lessons from the U.S. bank failures for our program of supervision and regulation.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20230629a.htm
2023-06-29,Financial Stability and Economic Developments,I will offer three observations about the events.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20230629a.htm
2023-06-29,Financial Stability and Economic Developments,The first observation is that it is very difficult to resist the natural human tendency to fight the last war.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20230629a.htm
2023-06-29,Financial Stability and Economic Developments,In 2008 we saw banks come under stress from outsized credit losses and insufficient liquidity.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20230629a.htm
2023-06-29,Financial Stability and Economic Developments,"Such losses appeared possible in the early days of the 2020 crisis, although they ultimately did not materialize.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20230629a.htm
2023-06-29,Financial Stability and Economic Developments,"In our stress tests, we have considered severe stress scenarios that produced losses on banks' books, including outsized credit losses.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20230629a.htm
2023-06-29,Financial Stability and Economic Developments,"But, of course, SVB's vulnerability came not from credit risk, but from excessive interest rate risk exposure and a business model that was vulnerable in ways its management did not fully appreciate, including a heavy reliance on uninsured deposits.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20230629a.htm
2023-06-29,Financial Stability and Economic Developments,These events suggest a need to strengthen our supervision and regulation of institutions of the size of SVB.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20230629a.htm
2023-06-29,Financial Stability and Economic Developments,"I look forward to evaluating proposals for such changes and implementing them where appropriate.2Much will depend on getting the specifics right, and we should bear in mind that there are always tradeoffs in any financial regulation.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20230629a.htm
2023-06-29,Financial Stability and Economic Developments,"In addition, the U.S. has benefited from its rich, multi-tiered banking ecosystem, and that diversity should be preserved.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20230629a.htm
2023-06-29,Financial Stability and Economic Developments,The second observation is the value of forthrightly recognizing when a crisis is building and responding decisively.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20230629a.htm
2023-06-29,Financial Stability and Economic Developments,"When SVB failed it was clear that a number of standard assumptions, even though they were informed by hard experience, were wrong.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20230629a.htm

2023-06-29,Financial Stability and Economic Developments,The third observation is the value of having the very largest banks be highly resilient.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20230629a.htm
2023-06-29,Financial Stability and Economic Developments,Our regulatory system is much stronger for the substantial additional safeguards we have built around the G-SIBs since the Great Recession.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20230629a.htm

2023-06-29,Financial Stability and Economic Developments,"In response, regulators in the U.S. and around the globe set out to build a much more resilient financial system.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20230629a.htm
2023-06-29,Financial Stability and Economic Developments,And the ensuing experiences of the pandemic and the past few months did much to validate this approach.,Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20230629a.htm

2023-01-10,"Panel on ""Central Bank Independence and the Mandate—Evolving Views""","Second, the Fed must continuously earn that independence by using our tools to achieve our assigned goals of maximum employment and price stability, and by providing transparency to facilitate understanding and effective oversight by the public and their elected representatives in Congress.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20230110a.htm

2023-01-10,"Panel on ""Central Bank Independence and the Mandate—Evolving Views""","Central bank independence and transparencyOn the first point, the case for monetary policy independence lies in the benefits of insulating monetary policy decisions from short-term political considerations.1Price stability is the bedrock of a healthy economy and provides the public with immeasurable benefits over time.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20230110a.htm

2023-01-10,"Panel on ""Central Bank Independence and the Mandate—Evolving Views""","At the Fed, we treat this as an active, not passive, responsibility, and over the past several decades we have steadily broadened our efforts to provide meaningful transparency about the basis for, and consequences of, the decisions we make in service to the American public.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20230110a.htm

2023-01-10,"Panel on ""Central Bank Independence and the Mandate—Evolving Views""","Independence in this area helps ensure that the public can be confident that our supervisory decisions are not influenced by political considerations.5Today, some analysts ask whether incorporating into bank supervision the perceived risks associated with climate change is appropriate, wise, and consistent with our existing mandates.",Speech,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20230110a.htm
