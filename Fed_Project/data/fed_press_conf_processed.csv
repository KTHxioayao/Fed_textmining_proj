2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"Transcript of Chairman Powell’s Press Conference March 21, 2018 CHAIRMAN POWELL."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,You see much higher liquidity.
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"So, if you look at the banking system, particularly the large financial institutions, you see higher capital."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,And I’ll go through a couple of pieces of that.
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"Since the financial crisis, we’ve been monitoring financial conditions and financial stability issues very carefully, and the FOMC receives regular briefings about the staff framework and, sort of, measures of various aspects of financial—financial stability risks, and the current view of the Committee is that financial stability vulnerabilities are moderate, let’s say."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,Thank you very much.
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"And do you have the tools you need, you think, to combat those?"
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,Are—do you see any bubbles?
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,I was wondering if you could give us your view on the asset markets.
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,Several of your colleagues recently have been speaking and expressing concern about financial imbalances and rising signs of financial imbalances.
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,Greg Robb from MarketWatch.
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,Thank you very much.
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"Thank you, Chairman."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,Over here.
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,GREG ROBB.
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"So, in fact, it’s not a subsidy, and it’s not a cost to the taxpayer."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"The assets that we have on the other side are Treasury securities and mortgage-backed securities, which yield much higher than interest on reserves."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"In addition, remember that those liabilities—those are our liabilities."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,So we’re paying rates that banks can get from other interest rates from other—any other investment in the short-term money markets.
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,We can’t pay interest on excess reserves that are—is above the general level of short-term interest rates.
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,We pay interest on excess reserves.
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"You mentioned the question of interest on excess reserves, and I think it’s a little bit of a misnomer to think that there’s a subsidy there."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,So it’s not something we’re looking at resolving in the near term.
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,You see them more aware of their risks and better able to manage them with stress testing.
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"So we don’t know what the demand is for reserves in a world where you have—you know, you have regulations that require banks to hold lots of high-quality liquid assets, and reserves are one of those."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"And if one—if something does go wrong, you’ve got—you’ve got better ability to deal with the failure of those institutions."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,You don’t see excess risk-taking in great quantity the way you did see before the crisis.
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"And then, my other question is, you know, you’ve talked a lot about how size isn’t the only thing that causes banks to pose systemic risk, and I was wondering, what other factors do you think would cause a bank to potentially pose a systemic risk?"
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,Is it possible to have CCAR not on an annual basis?
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"So, for CCAR, those stress tests, since that’s based around, you know, having a punitive penalty of potentially being able to restrict dividend payouts or stock buybacks, is there any kind of logistical challenge that could be posed if you don’t have CCAR every year for certain banks?"
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,And so I had a couple of questions about that.
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"More on the regulatory side, you know, the Fed might soon be getting more power to decide exactly which regulations—which stricter regulations to apply to banks with between $100 and $250 billion in assets."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,Victoria Guida with Politico.
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,Hi.
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,VICTORIA GUIDA.
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"We regularly use that to—as a way to test against various, you know, market shocks, certainly for the larger institutions."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,We have—I think the stress test is a really important tool that we have for the largest financial institutions and for the smaller financial institutions.
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"In terms of whether we have the tools, you know, we have some tools, and I think we certainly—we use them."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"And so, overall, if you put all of that into a pie, what you have is moderate vulnerabilities, in our view."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"But we don’t see it in housing, which is key."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,You can think of commercial real estate prices in certain markets.
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,You can think of some equity prices.
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"So, in some areas, asset prices are elevated relative to their longer-run historical norms."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"You identified the—really, one area where—which is an area of focus, which is asset prices."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"Overall, those aspects, I think, suggest low levels of vulnerability."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"I should mention also that for large financial institutions, they’re no longer funded by a lot of short-term wholesale funding, which can disappear very quickly, so they’re far less vulnerable to liquidity issues."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,So those readings look okay.
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"And, of course, default rates are very low."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"If you look at nonfinancial corporations, you see—you do see relatively elevated levels of borrowing, but nothing that suggests, you know, serious risks."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"If you look at households, household balance sheets are in much better condition."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"So, therefore, you don’t see high leverage."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"For example, one—in the long-run, the size of the balance sheet is going to depend on the public’s demand for our liabilities, including currency and reserves."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,But it’s—and it’s not something I see us as needing to urgently address.
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"You know, we don’t have the ability to see that far into the future, so I really wouldn’t put a lot in that."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,It’s highly uncertain.
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"You know, I would say that—remember that forecasts three years out—so, you’re right, in 2020 there’s a—I think it’s 3.4 percent is the median of the SEP dots for 2020, which is 40 basis points above the estimates of the neutral rate, which I would characterize as, you know, modestly restrictive, modestly tightening policy, but that’s three years in the future."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,Thanks.
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"And, as a follow-up, is that fiscal stimulus starting to lead to questions within the Fed around this narrative of secular stagnation and the economy entering a new sort of “low rates” environment?"
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"Which is asking, in a way, about the fiscal policy."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,Does that increase the risk of a Fed-induced recession and decrease the risk of a soft landing?
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"In 2020, it shows that policymakers expect the policy rate to get up almost to 3½ percent, which is quite a ways—or, definitively, anyways—above the neutral rate."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"I take your caveats on the dot plot, as it were, but I’ll ask another question."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"Chairman Powell, Jonathan Spicer with Reuters."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,JONATHAN SPICER.
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,I think estimates are really all over the place in terms of the amount and the timing of those.
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"It’s not something that we can really do at the Fed, but, you know, we’re certainly hopeful that there will be supply-side effects like that from the tax bill."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,So I do think it’s very important that we have a focus on productivity in the country.
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"In theory, an individual tax bill that lowers tax rates should encourage more labor force participation."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,I think in the tax bill there’s—there are incentives for—there—a tax cut bill that allows expensing of investments should encourage additional investment that should encourage productivity.
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"And, you know, you asked me about fiscal policy and the connection to productivity."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"It has moved up just a little bit but not, kind of, decisively."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"So that’s well below, you know, longer-run averages, and it would certainly be a good thing to see it move up."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"It’s averaged only about 0.5 percent a year for the last six years, I guess."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"In terms of productivity—productivity, as I’m sure you know, has been very weak since the financial crisis."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,I can’t be any more specific than that.
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,It could make sense.
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,I think we’re continuing to learn about this framework.
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"You could imagine narratives in which that would make sense, but I honestly I wouldn’t put too much on that."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,JONATHAN SPICER.
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"We’ve had meetings where we’ve talked about it, and we’ve agreed that it’s working well."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,We haven’t really addressed that question.
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,We haven’t made a decision to keep that as our longer-run framework.
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,And it’s— you described it accurately.
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"We have excellent control over rates, and it’s working."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,Our current framework for implementing monetary policy is working very well.
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,Sure.
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"And do you have any concern that if you do stick with the current system that, as rates rise, that you might see issues where the Fed is under—is being criticized for paying out ever larger shares of money to banks to, you know, to control interest rates that some might perceive as a subsidy to the banks that are getting this money?"
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,I wanted to know whether you favor sticking with the system that you have now of keeping interest on excess reserves and reverse repo—the reverse repo rate to control interest rates—or do you want to shift back to the old way of doing things at some point of targeting the fed funds market?
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,I have a question about the future of the mechanics of monetary policy.
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,Mike Derby from Dow Jones Newswires.
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,Hi.
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,MICHAEL DERBY.
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,I think all of us would agree that we hope that they will be large.
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"I think, as you look around the table at the FOMC, there’s a wide range of views on the amount and the timing of those."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,We don’t know what the timing would be.
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,We don’t know how big those effects are going to be.
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"I would say in the bill that passed Congress, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, there were elements that should encourage productivity, as I mentioned—sorry, encourage investment, which should help productivity, encourage labor force participation."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"So, you know, I think it’s really important that we do something—do what we can as a country to increase our potential growth rate."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"You know, we’ve been through many years of growth around 2 percent, and I’ve given a number of public remarks where I’ve called on, you know, the country to focus more on potential growth and productivity and labor force participation, which drive potential growth."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,The second question was whether the secular stagnation narrative—whether fiscal policy is being questioned by the Fed around that?
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"Sorry, your second question was?"
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,Okay.
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"So, this is a matter that Congress has under consideration."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"It’s not something—so Congress is looking at raising the threshold for applying enhanced financial standards to—from $50 billion to $250 billion, while leaving us with the ability to reach below $250 billion and apply those standards where we think it’s appropriate."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"If the economy behaves as the Fed is predicting, by the time of the midterm elections, the rates will be—keep on rising, and the prime rate will be above—well above 5 percent, a level not reached in 10 years for what is a base of consumer credit."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,Virginie Montet with Agence France-Presse.
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,VIRGINIE MONTET.
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"In terms of what’s the right level, I don’t think I have a view on what the right level of wages is, but I think we will—we will know that the labor market is getting tight when we do see a more meaningful upward move in wages."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"And I would—I think I’ve been surprised by that, and I think others have as well."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"On the other hand, as the market has tightened, as labor markets have tightened, and we hear reports of labor shortages and we see that, you know, groups of unemployed are diminishing, and the unemployment rate is going down, we haven’t seen, you know, higher wages—wages going up more."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"So these low wage increases—in a sense, they do make sense in that—from that perspective."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,Inflation’s been low.
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,And productivity’s been very low.
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,You should get paid for your productivity plus inflation.
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"So, on the one hand, what wages should in theory represent is inflation plus productivity increases."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"As I mentioned, you know, we’ve had unemployment decline sharply since, I guess, 2010, when it peaked at 10 percent and down to 4.1 percent now, and we’ve seen only modest increases in wages."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,Are you satisfied with the rate of wage growth right now?
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,Does the interest rate hike today suggest that Americans are being paid enough?
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,Nancy Marshall-Genzer with Marketplace.
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER.
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"And, let me say, you know, we don’t do trade policy here at the Fed, and, you know, I would be reluctant to comment on any particular situation with any particular country."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,That didn’t—it’s not something that came up in particular.
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,CHAIMRAN POWELL.
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"I mean, in the event that the United States and China—in the event that the U.S. and China end up in a tit-for-tat trade war, or any other retaliatory actions that are imposed elsewhere against the United States, what that means for the global economic outlook, and whether that was something that was discussed and are you worried about."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,Yes.
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,DONNA BORAK.
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"And we know that, historically, raising rates—especially in campaign times—has never been very popular in the White House."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"You know—your second question, sorry, was China?"
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,Does this prospect of a possible pressure and dichotomy of concerns keep you awake at night?
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,No.
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,Thank you very much.
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"It’s hard to find in the research data, but nonetheless, I think those are issues that we’ll be watching carefully."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"But, having said that, I think it’s—there are good questions about what a flat yield curve or inverted yield curve does to intermediation."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"That’s really not the situation we’re in now, so I don’t know that that’s—I don’t know that—I don’t think that recession probabilities are particularly high at the moment, any higher than they normally are."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"I think it’s true that yield curves have tended to predict recessions if you look back over many cycles, but a lot of that was just situations in which inflation was allowed to get out of control, and the Fed had to tighten, and that put the economy into a recession."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"You know, it’s an interesting question, and there are a range of views there."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"So, I’m just curious if you guys have discussed that, if you’d be willing to push back against that, or if that’s a dynamic you’d be comfortable with?"
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"This is a dynamic that has typically preceded recessions, and we’re likely to see shorter-term rates come up as the Fed continues to increase rates."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"We continue to see the spread between the 2-year and the 10-year tighten, even with longer-term yields coming up since the beginning of the year."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"Chair Powell, I’m curious if the Fed would be willing to tolerate an inverted yield curve."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"Myles Udland, Yahoo Finance."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,Thanks.
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,MYLES UDLAND.
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"The financial crisis, of course, was just really getting going 10 years ago."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"So, it’s a healthier economy than it’s been in 10 years."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"On the other hand, the economy’s healthier than it’s been since—since before the financial crisis."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"By the way, I’m hearing this, the 10-year thing a few times these days, and it’s true that rates are higher than they’ve been in 10 years."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"You’re right, that’s the highest rate."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,You can count on us to stay focused on the jobs that Congress has assigned us and count on us to use the tools we have to achieve them.
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"You know, we—we’re looking very carefully at our assigned responsibilities of maximum employment, stable prices, and that’s really our focus."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,We don’t consider the election cycle.
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,That doesn’t keep me awake at night.
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,So that’s not something that did come up.
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"They didn’t get into talking about particular—you know, whether it’s inflation or growth or whatever it would be."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,That’s really what people were saying.
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,Michael McKee from Bloomberg Television and Radio.
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,MICHAEL MCKEE.
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"I mean, there would be a range of things, you know—how well capitalized is the institution, but mainly those things."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"So, that’s—that would be the next thing on the list."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"They’re speculating on markets, and—you know, so very different business models and different levels of risk and that sort of thing."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,That’s what they do.
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"Another business model might be, you know, if you think of a hedge fund, right?"
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"So, you know, we—regular way commercial banks that do deposit taking and lending and don’t speculate in markets, you know, that’s one business model."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"Well, it’s—I guess the next thing on the list would be activities."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,Sure.
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,About what causes banks to pose systemic risk beyond size.
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,VICTORIA GUIDA.
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,And the second question you had was?
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"I would think it would be, but it’s certainly not something that we’ve decided to do."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"Is it, you know, logistically possible?"
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"We would want to think very carefully about that, and, you know, we would—whatever we do decide to do, we’d put that out for comment."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,We haven’t made any decision about that at all.
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"The version of the bill, I think, that passed the Senate did have—did give us the ability to do supervisory stress tests periodically, as opposed to annually, is the language."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,It’s not something that’s been—been taken.
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,But this is a decision that’s in the hands of Congress.
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,So we are fully prepared to do that.
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"And, you know, we haven’t been shy about doing that, because, of course, one of the eight SIFIs is below 250 already."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,I’d like to go back to the idea of the additional growth that you’re getting from the fiscal package and ask you how much you think comes from the supply side and how much from demand?
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,Is this something that’s going to happen?
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"Do we know that there’s going to be a supply-side effect, or are you just guessing at this point?"
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"You know, at this stage, what our FOMC participants discussed—it wasn’t—it was—it was just that this is a new risk that had been probably a low- profile risk, which has become, you know, a more prominent risk to the outlook."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,Wondering what your thoughts are of how that might dampen the economic—the global economic outlook going forward should that occur.
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"And, secondly, you know, we might be on the verge of a tit-for-tat trade war with China."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"You said that participants today generally are feeling that the trade policy shouldn’t necessarily affect the current economic outlook, but I am wondering if there was any discussion—if there are fears about inflationary effects, should there be trade barriers imposed?"
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"Just to go back to trade policy, if you don’t mind."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,Donna Borak with CNN.
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"Hi, Chair Powell."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,DONNA BORAK.
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"We’ve discussed it with our in-house experts and come up with our own views, and they’re disparate, but that’s— I’d say that’s about where the—where the views are."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,We’ve all thought about it.
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"So—and the kind of things people are talking about would be, you know, more widespread retaliation and more widespread actions back-and-forth kind of thing."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"And, you know, we’ve all looked at the literature carefully."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"The whole thing is very uncertain, and particularly the supply-side effects should and would be expected to take longer to appear and would be less certain in amount."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,You should see some labor supply effects over time from lower individual effective tax rates.
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"At the same time, the—you know, I mentioned labor supply."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"It isn’t the only factor or the principle factor, but it should result in more investment, and investment should drive productivity."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"I mean, I spent many years of my life working with companies and discussing—and, you know, the cost of capital is one of many factors that they’ll consider."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"It’s uncertain, though."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"If you make investment more attractive, companies should do more of it."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"I think there’s a general view as well that supply-side issues—that there could be supply-side effects as well, and you would see that again through higher investment, driven by lower corporate tax rates and the expensing of some investment, which would drive—tend to drive productivity over time."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"If I could try to summarize, it would be that, I think, broadly speaking, participants believe there will be meaningful increases in demand from the new fiscal policies for at least the next, let’s say, three years."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"So there’s a real diversity of views on this, particularly on these fiscal issues."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"Remember that there are 15 FOMC participants, and we—each of us has his or her own forecast."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,So that’s really as good as you can go.
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,And they’re seeing it as a risk-to-the-outlook kind of thing.
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"You use words like “might” and “should” about what results should come from this process, but, around the table, did any of the presidents or Governors report that businesses are actually getting ready to spend?"
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"Is it 2¼, 2½, 2¾?"
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,And how high above 2 percent is too high to maintain a target that is symmetric?
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,Would the Fed be willing to accept the type of overshoot of its target as it has seen during the undershoot?
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,How do you define symmetric relative to the experience of the past five years?
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,I want to understand what symmetry means in the context of inflation being allowed to run above the 2 percent target now that that’s part of the projection for—at least for core PCE next year.
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"Chair Powell, I want to ask about the symmetric inflation target—what you outlined in your remarks as preventing persistent deviations."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,I’m Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal.
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,Thanks.
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,NICK TIMIRAOS.
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"So we’re trying to take that middle ground, and the Committee continues to believe that the middle ground consists of further gradual increases in the federal funds rate as long as the economy is broadly on this path."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"We need that, and it’s, you know, we need to make sure that inflation expectations are anchored at 2 percent."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"The—on the other side, if we—if we raise rates too quickly, inflation, then, really doesn’t get sustainably up to 2 percent, and, that will hurt us going forward."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,We don’t want to do that.
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"So, you know, on the one hand, the risk would be that we wait too long, and then we have to raise rates quickly, and that foreshortens the expansion."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"You know, I think we’re trying to, we’re trying to be, to take the middle ground there."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"And your biggest concern or your biggest risk here—is it doing too much, doing too little?"
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,STEVE LIESMAN.
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"So I think when you see those small changes in unemployment, that simply reflects the, you know, the flatness of the Phillips curve, if you will."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"But, it has diminished, but it’s still there."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,And that suggests that the relationship between changes in slack and inflation is not so tight.
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,You’ve only seen very gradual upward pressures on inflation and wages despite that very large increase.
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,It’s now 4.1 percent.
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"And also, for how long?"
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"And I think that reflects, essentially—if you think back to the era after the crisis, unemployment was 10 percent."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,We’ve also said—in minutes and in speeches and things like that—that that is a symmetric objective.
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,The full range is interesting.
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,I would also say that the central tendency is interesting.
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,I would—and that’s an interesting statistic.
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"And, you’ve identified the median as 2.7 percent."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,The Summary of Economic Projections is individual forecasts compiled and written down.
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"The Committee made really one decision at this meeting, and that was to raise the federal funds rate by 25 basis points."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,So the Summary of Economic Projections is really a compilation of the individual rate forecasts.
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"You know, let me say what that really is."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,Is the continued talk in Washington about tax cuts bringing growth to 3 percent or higher on a sustained basis overselling their potential impact?
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"Even with the extra fiscal stimulus of the tax cuts, your median growth projection is just up to 2.7 percent, and then—this year—and then drops back down to 2 percent by 2020."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,Jim Puzzanghera with the L.A. Times.
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"Hi, Mr. Chairman."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,JIM PUZZANGHERA.
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"And—and also, just the duration of it as well."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"You know, we have to balance that against the deviation of employment from— unemployment from its goal."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"And in doing that, we’re going to be considering, by the way, the other side of the mandate."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,It just is that we’re always going to be seeking 2 percent inflation.
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"It just, you know, it, we haven’t agreed on that."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,I can’t give you an exact number.
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"We were always pushing toward 2 percent, and I think that is how we look at it."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"And, I think it’s—I wouldn’t characterize what we’ve done over the last five years as tolerating, you know, an undershoot of inflation."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"So, that’s how we think of it."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"You know, so as you noted, the—what we’ve said in the longer-run statement of goals and monetary policy strategy is that we would be concerned with sustained or persistent deviations of inflation either above or below."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"The Committee’s estimates of growth went up, the Committee’s estimates of unemployment went down, and there was a very slight increase in inflation."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"So, you’re right that the outlook did improve, as I mentioned and as you—as was in your question."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"The median projection for unemployment—for the unemployment rate stands at 3.8 percent in the fourth quarter of this year and runs at 3.6 percent over the next two years, almost a percentage point below the median estimate of its longer-run normal rate."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"Based on the projections that Committee participants submitted for this meeting, the median projection for the growth of inflation-adjusted GDP is 2.7 percent this year, 2.4 percent next year, and 2 percent in 2020, a bit above its estimated longer-run rate."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,Our inflation objective is symmetric in the sense that we are trying to prevent persistent deviations from 2 percent in either direction.
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"At times it may be above 2 percent, just as at times it may be below."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"Of course, various forces will continue to affect inflation."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"In coming months, as those earlier declines drop out of the calculation, inflation should move up closer to 2 percent and stabilize around that level over the medium term."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"However, as we have noted for some time, the shortfall of inflation from 2 percent reflects, at least partly, some unusual price declines that occurred nearly a year ago."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"The core price index, which excludes the prices of energy and food and is typically a better indicator of future inflation, rose 1.5 percent over the same period."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"Overall consumer prices, as measured by the price index for personal consumption expenditures, increased 1.7 percent in the 12 months ending in January."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"Against this backdrop, inflation remains below our 2 percent longer-run objective."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,1 Chairman Powell intended to say that the Committee had raised the target “range” for the federal funds rate.
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"Several factors are supporting the outlook: Fiscal policy has become more stimulative, ongoing job gains are boosting incomes and confidence, foreign growth is on a firm trajectory, and overall financial conditions remain accommodative."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"Indeed, the economic outlook has strengthened in recent months."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"Although the growth rates of household spending and business investment appear to have moderated early this year, gains in the fourth quarter were strong and the fundamentals underpinning demand remain solid."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"That’s a sign of improvement, given that the aging of our population is putting downward pressure on the participation rate, and we expect that the job market will remain strong."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"Over the past four years, the participation rate has remained roughly unchanged."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"The unemployment rate remained low in February at 4.1 percent, while the labor force participation rate moved higher."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"Job gains averaged 240,000 per month over the past three months, well above the pace needed in the longer run to absorb new entrants into the labor force."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"As you already know, we decided today to raise the target rate for the federal funds rate by ¼ percentage point, bringing it to 1½ to 1¾ percent.1 This decision marks another step in the ongoing process of gradually scaling back monetary policy accommodation—a process that has been under way for several years now."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"The job market remains strong, the economy continues to expand, and inflation appears to be moving toward the FOMC’s 2 percent longer-run goal."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"I have a brief statement, and then I’ll be happy to respond to your questions."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,Good afternoon.
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"You know, for trade, what I mentioned is that our FOMC participants reported in that they had heard, you know, concerns, which were relatively new, about—about future trade actions, really."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"Finally, the median inflation projection is 1.9 percent this year, 2 percent next year, and 2.1 percent in 2020."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"Compared with the projections made in December, real GDP growth is stronger, the unemployment rate is lower, and inflation is slightly higher."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"As I noted earlier, today’s decision to raise the federal funds rate is another step in the process of gradually scaling back monetary policy accommodation as the economic expansion continues."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"This gradual process has been under way for more than two years, and it has served—and should continue to serve—the economy well."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,Is it in overkill when it comes to rates or underkill?
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,Where's your biggest concern here?
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"And how is it that, in that context, you justify three rate hikes this year—and I sense there’ll be three next year—and a full $600 billion, I guess, annual rate decline in the balance sheet?"
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,What does that say about what you and the Committee believe about the inflation dynamic?
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"A higher growth forecast a full point above the long run, lower unemployment seven-tenths below the long run, and yet very little change in inflation."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,Interesting changes in the forecast.
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"Mr. Chairman, welcome."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"Mr. Chairman—right, the microphone."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,STEVE LIESMAN.
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"As always, the Committee would be prepared to use its full range of tools if future economic conditions were to warrant a more accommodative monetary policy than can be achieved solely by reducing the federal funds rate."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"As we’ve said, changing the target range for the federal funds rate is our primary means of adjusting the stance of monetary policy."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,So you have a range of views around the table.
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"Barring a very significant and unexpected weakening in the outlook, we do not intend to alter this program."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"If the outlook changes, we will adjust monetary policy appropriately."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"Of course, we’ll be watching how the economy evolves in the months and years ahead relative to our maximum employment and price stability objectives."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,The medians for 2019 and 2020 are somewhat higher than in December.
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"Most participants revised up their projections since December, although the median projection for this year did not change."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"By 2020, the median federal funds rate is modestly above its estimated longer-run trend."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"The median projection for the federal funds rate is 2.1 percent at the end of this year, 2.9 percent at the end of 2019, and 3.4 percent at the end of 2020."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,Participants’ projections of the appropriate path for the federal funds rate reflect our gradual approach.
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"At the same time, we want to avoid inflation running persistently below our objective, which could leave us with less scope to counter an economic downturn in the future."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"By contrast, raising rates too slowly would raise the risk that monetary policy would need to tighten abruptly down the road, which could jeopardize the economic expansion."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"In the Committee’s view, further gradual increases in the federal funds rate will best promote these goals."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"In making our policy decisions over the next few years, we will continue to aim for inflation of 2 percent while sustaining the economic expansion and a strong labor market."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"Finally, I’ll note that our program for reducing our balance sheet, which began in October, is proceeding smoothly."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"One of the great benefits of our system is that we do have Reserve Banks with their own staffs and Governors with different views, and so we discuss these things."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"Thank you, and I’ll be happy to take your questions now."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"That’s really all I can say—2.7 just happens to be the median for ’18, but it doesn’t really say, you know, what we think is possible."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"Well, the—you’re right."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"It’s such a—that’s a major increase in government stimulus that you’re—that had to have had an impact on the discussions, I would think, though."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"That had no impact, though?"
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,MARTIN CRUTSINGER.
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"And, really, it’s the policymakers that then take that as input and create their forecasts, which are what drive policy."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,It’s a particular thing under—done under particular rules and circumstances.
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"So—and it’s really the policymakers’ views that we talk about in the SEP. We don’t—we don’t, you know, talk about the staff forecast."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"So we look at the staff forecasts and the Board forecasts—and, by the way, there are 12 excellent Reserve Bank staffs who have their own views and do their own work—we look at those as informing the decisions of the policymakers."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,CHAIRIMAN POWELL.
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,And how did that impact the discussions?
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"Can you tell us anything, though, about the staff forecast and how that was impacted by the—we had a $1½ trillion tax cut, we’ve had $300 billion in increased government spending—the staff forecast that you’re working with, are those reflected—how were they impacted by that?"
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,You talked about the fact that the Summary of Economic Projections is based on the outlook of all the members of the FOMC.
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,Marty Crutsinger with the Associated Press.
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,MARTIN CRUTSINGER.
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"Second thing is, I would say, is that a number of participants reported in—about their conversations with business leaders around the country and reported that trade policy has become a concern going forward for that group."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"So, on the second question, on tariffs, a number of participants in this FOMC did bring up the issue of tariffs, and if I could summarize what came out of that, it was, first, that there’s no thought, I think, that changes in trade policy should have any effect on the current outlook."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"We’re going to use monetary policy as the principle tool of adjusting, you know, our policy."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,And I have no inclination to revisit that.
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"We announced it, and we said we wouldn’t change it, really, unless there were a significant downturn that required, you know, meaningful reductions in interest rates."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,We carefully socialized it in a series of meetings last year.
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"So, in terms of the balance sheet, we’ve said that, you know, we carefully developed this plan."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"So fiscal stimulus is a, you know, a meaningful input into, you know, into the SEP and particularly in the changes over the course of last year and this year."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"And individual policymakers went through, with their staffs, a range of estimates, a range of literature, and did their own thinking and came up with their own estimates and submitted those as their Summary of Economic Projections—as their projections."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,Those are not the staff’s projections.
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,Those are our projections.
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"What’s your current assessment of the path of productivity growth, and has anything in policy—any policy change in recent months changed that assessment?"
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"So the Committee doesn’t vote or agree upon the medians, so you’re going to have a range of views."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"And then, the second question is, you mentioned productivity growth earlier."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"On trade, what would have to happen in policy—and, in particular, in potential retaliation from countries around the world—for trade policy to become a concern for the Committee’s outlook?"
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"Mr. Chairman, a quick follow on the trade question, and then a productivity question."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,JIM TANKERSLEY.
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"Not, no."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,So it wasn’t one factor that was pulling at the heart of the discussion?
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,HEATHER LONG.
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"I wouldn’t want to—for now, these are the best forecasts that people could make, and, you know, it could be that if the economy’s a little bit stronger or a little bit weaker, then the path could be a little less gradual or a little more gradual."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,And do you have a timeline as to how you would respond to that?
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,It could change down.
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,So that’s really all I can say.
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"And, you know, you’re mentioning the median as being, you know, three and four being close, but, you know, I think, like any set of forecasts, those forecasts will change over time, and they’ll change depending on the way the outlook for the economy changes."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,The projections are really just individual projections that are submitted and then compiled.
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"I would go back to the thought that, you know, we made one decision at this meeting, and that decision was to raise the federal funds rate by 25 basis points."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,Can you give us some more insight into why people didn’t go to four this time—the median—even though the economic projections look very healthy?
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,Is it just that people want to wait and see a little longer before they raise?
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,Is it concerns about these potential trade tariffs that are going into effect?
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"It’s clear from the dot plot that many members do think four would be appropriate, but clearly something was holding a number of the FOMC members back."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"Heather Long, Washington Post."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,HEATHER LONG.
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,It could change up.
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"And, then a second question, things beyond your control—the President is expected to announce new tariffs against China, and does the Committee discuss what potential impacts that could have in regards to inflation?"
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,I—what will it take to get to four rate hikes this year?
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,Adam Shapiro with the Fox Business Network.
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"So we would know that then, and we’re very alert to it, but it’s not something we observe at the present."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"I guess the idea—the theory would be that if you get below the sustainable rate of unemployment for a sustained period, you would see an acceleration of inflation."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,We’ll be alert to that.
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"We have seen moderate increases in wages and price inflation, and we seem to be seeing more of that."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"As I mentioned earlier, there is no—there’s no sense in the data that we’re on the cusp of an acceleration of inflation."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"So, as—if inflation—if unemployment does continue to go down, we’ll continue to do that."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"So I don’t think we, we—we’re mindful of the uncertainty of that, and we’ll be looking at that."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"As they see unemployment going lower, they’re looking at a variety of aspects of the labor market, including wage inflation and price inflation."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"So the Committee—and, I think, people—are generally influenced by data."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"So as the—as the actual unemployment rate has declined from 10 percent to 4.1 percent, the Committee’s median estimate of the natural rate of unemployment has also declined by a full percentage point."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"We look at a wide range of indicators on that—you know, 15 or 20 of them at least."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,So I guess I’d start by saying that the natural rate of unemployment is not something that we can observe directly.
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"And, if you start to question that, how is that going to impact policy?"
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"So obviously you guys reduced your NAIRU estimates slightly today, but if you continue to see job gains around 200,000 a month, primary labor participation rising slightly, pretty sustainably, you know, moderate wage increases, at what point are you guys going to start to question whether you’re actually overshooting full employment?"
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"Hi, Jeanna Smialek with Bloomberg News."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,JEANNA SMIALEK.
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"It would take, you know, significant increases in productivity and labor force participation to get there."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"You know, I would say it’s hard to say, but it would take—you know, that is well above almost all estimates, current estimates of potential long-run growth."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"You brought up the fiscal stimulus and the impact it’s having, and I was curious, how is the change in the federal budget deficit—because the stimulus is coming with great debt—has it changed your approach to how many securities you’re going to allow to roll off the balance sheet, and is there a level of Treasury supply at which the Fed would consider adjusting its balance sheet roll-off, given how much the U.S. government’s going to have to borrow going forward?"
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,But do you think you can get to 3 percent on a sustained basis?
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,JIM PUZZANGHERA.
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,SAM FLEMING.
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,Thanks very much.
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"And also, I think we all understand that any point estimate is surrounded by very wide uncertainty bands."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,You and other policymakers have talked about headwinds turning into tailwinds recently.
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,I would want to think very carefully about it and make sure that no one would take more frequent press conferences as a signal of the path of policy.
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,Sam Fleming from Financial Times.
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,My colleagues and I are committed to communicating as clearly as possible about what we’re doing and why we’re doing it.
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,I have not made a decision about it.
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,So that’s something that I’m going to be carefully considering.
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"Ah, press conferences."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,SAM FLEMING.
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"But it’s—I think, generally speaking, the Committee sees the neutral rate of interest as still quite low and is not—is not seeing it as having moved up and is open to the possibility that it will."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"In fact, it did tick up one-tenth, as you all know, in the—in the median at this time."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,ADAM SHAPIRO.
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,There’s—there are reasons that that might be the case.
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,And press conferences?
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"So is it possible that the neutral rate of interest would move up because of, for example, greater fiscal expansion?"
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"Does that imply that you think now a higher neutral rate of interest is operative in the U.S. economy, and how would you assess the implications for monetary policy?"
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,There’s literature that says that.
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"And second question—this is obviously your first press conference, so it’s a little early to ask this question, but would you like to do this more often?"
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,Thanks.
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"And so, it is something that I’ll be thinking about."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,So they don’t—they don’t move around very much.
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"So I wouldn’t expect the Committee’s, you know, predictions or projections or estimates of those values to move quickly."
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,They’ll move slowly.
2018-03-21,Press Conf - Q&A,"Longer-run values like the neutral rate of interest, the natural rate of unemployment, the potential growth rate of the economy are pinned down by slow- moving forces over time."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"So since you—since even before you were Chairman of the Fed, when you were chair of the supervisory committee, you laid out a sort of regulatory revision agenda that’s actually been pretty consistent."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"So there was the guidance on boards of governors, there was the—some changes to the stress tests, and—not changes to the stress test, but rather clarification on the modeling—and now, more recently, the changes to the enhanced supplemental leverage ratio."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"The Fed has also proposed some changes to the Volcker rule and, as I mentioned a minute ago, changes to the stress test with the stress capital buffer."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,Are these kind of the—are there any new frontiers of regulatory changes that you are envisioning or are you just—are you kind of done for the time being?
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,Or what else can we expect from the Fed?
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"You mentioned a number of the things, but I would—I would point out—we’re having, I guess, a public Board meeting tomorrow on the single counterparty credit limit provision."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,It’s actually a pretty full docket right now.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,We’ve also got quite a lot of work to promulgate rules to—after S. 2155 that Senator Crapo’s bill passed—we’ve got a lot of work to do under that.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,So what am I missing?
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"So there’s a lot of work to do, I think."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"There’s—there—oh, oh, net stable funding ratio is out there to be done."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"You know, and if I can just take this opportunity to say, you know, the financial system all but failed 10 years ago."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"We’ve got to think about how we would reach below that $250 billion threshold to assess and supervise, regulate, you know, financial stability risks below that level."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"Could that change, you asked, over a couple of years?"
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,JOHN HELTMAN.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"They’re—they’ve paid down their debt, incomes are rising, people have jobs."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,So households are not really a concern.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"We went to work for 10 years to strengthen it—stronger capital, stronger liquidity, stress testing, resolution planning."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"You have—you know, households are well—you know, are in good shape."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"And banks are highly capitalized, so that’s not really a concern."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,We see—there’s some concern with asset prices in a couple of pockets.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"Hi, John Heltman with American Banker."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"But overall, if you—if you bake it all in, I think we see, generally, financial vulnerabilities as moderate."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,You also asked about marijuana businesses.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,So this is a very difficult area because we have state law—many state laws permit the use of marijuana and federal law still doesn’t.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"So it puts, you know, federally chartered banks in a very difficult situation."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,I think it would be great if that could be clarified.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"We don’t have—you know, it puts the supervisor in a very, very difficult position."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"And, of course, this isn’t our—our mandate has nothing to do with marijuana, so we don’t really—we just would love to see it clarified, I think."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"Yeah, it could."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,We want to keep all that stuff.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"But, at this time, the— continuing on that gradual pace seems—continues to seem like the right thing."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,We want to tailor those regulations for institutions.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"So if—you know, if inflation stays around 2, it doesn’t go above 2 for a while, do you see a need to actually exceed that neutral point?"
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,I would say that they’re roughly at normal.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,And how will you know when we’re getting close to that neutral point?
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,Do you think it’s—do you see it sort of inching up because of the recent fiscal stimulus measures?
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,Where do you see the neutral interest rate is right now?
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"Hi, David Harrison with Dow Jones Newswires."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,DAVID HARRISON.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"If we get a sense that the economy is reacting badly, then we’ll certainly react to that."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,We had a lot of encouragement to go much faster and I’m really glad we didn’t.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,I think that patience has borne fruit and I think it continues to.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,I think we’ve been patient.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"We’re—we’ve been very, very careful not to tighten too quickly."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"That’s really what we’re trying to do and, you know, I would say I like the results so far."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"We want to make it, you know, even more effective and certainly more efficient."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"And so what we’re doing is, we are trying to conduct monetary policy in a way that will sustain that expansion, keep the labor markets strong, and keep inflation above—right at—sorry, not above, but right at 2 percent."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"If you survey businesses, they’ll say that workers are scarce."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"If you ask—if you survey workers about the job market, they’ll say that it’s a really good environment to find jobs."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"Look at businesses, confidence is high."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"If you look at household surveys, confidence is high."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"You know, I would say that the economy is in great shape."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,Thank you.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"And so, okay, I wanted to know what you would say to workers who are worried that, you know, these paths of rate hikes that you’ve laid out will kind of undercut the wage growth they are just starting to see."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,You said at the beginning of your press conference that you plan to be more plainspoken.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,Thank you.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,GREG ROBB.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"But we—we’re finding a lot that we can do in the way of tailoring regulations for the smaller, less systemically important institutions, and that’s a lot of what we’re working on right now."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,And so we’re committed to preserving and enhancing that structure.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,We want the strongest provisions to apply to the most systemically important institutions.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"So I think overall, we have—we have a really solid economy on our hands here."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,I wouldn’t say that—I wouldn't look at today’s financial stability landscape and say that risks are meaningfully above normal.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,That’s the language that we’ve used.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"It’s really important that inflation not fall below 2 percent, that inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2 percent—very important—because the implications of inflation below 2 percent are that you’re closer to the zero lower bound, meaning the Fed has less room to cut, meaning that we’ll spend more time there and we won’t be able to do the job that we’re assigned to do for our citizens."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,Inflation was too high and central banks were constantly pushing down.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"Of course, all those years when we were growing up, it was the opposite."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,And so we’ve been pushing back up.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"I think in—in recent years the dominant force has been, you know, disinflationary—have been pushing down on inflation."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,And we have to be strongly committed to achieving that using our tools to do that.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"You know, inflation we look about—we look at the 2 percent inflation objective as something that central banks, the Fed, really control."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,You asked about inflation.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"But, you know, the thing is, if you look back, there have been a lot of studies done and, you know, real- time estimates of the natural rate of unemployment have uncertainty bands, which are—which are quite wide, so we have to remember that and very much be guided by the—by the incoming data."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"As the economy gets hotter and hotter, there’s some possibility of that."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"So, you know, it may—it may have moved down too, on a cyclical basis, lower."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"It tends to be driven by slow- moving variables, like the education level, the population, like the functioning of the labor market, and things like that."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"We don’t think that the natural rate of unemployment— you know, it’s not one of those variables that moves around a lot."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,So I think we do believe it has moved down significantly over a long period of time.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,JEANNA SMIALEK.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"Your question—your first question, really, is, do we think the natural rate of unemployment is lower?"
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"So with the numbers that we’re looking at, you talked about more people getting jobs, the wages are increasing."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,Edward Lawrence from Fox Business.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,EDWARD LAWRENCE.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"What we really need is to have the federal funds rate trade in the range, and that’s what this minor technical adjustment accomplishes."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"And, frankly, we don’t have to know today."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"We don’t know that that’s the only effect and, you know, we’re just going to have to be watching and learning."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"You know, I think there’s a lot of probability on the idea of just high bill supply leads to higher repo costs, higher money market rates generally, and the arbitrage pulls up federal funds rate towards IOER."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"It’s—you can’t run experiments, you know, with one effect and not the other."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"Really, no one does."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"And yes, you know, we—of course, we’re looking carefully at that and, you know, the truth is we don’t—we don’t know with any precision."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,You asked why.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"Again, don’t expect it to happen."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"So I would just point you to the range of estimates at the Committee, which I think is 2¼ to 3½, and the median is 2.9, right in there."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"If we have to do it again, we’ll do it again."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"Are we seeing a—with the fiscal policy—a fundamental shift in the economy, where we have lower natural unemployment, also possibly a lower rate of natural unemployment and lower inflation?"
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,And that’s certainly a possibility.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,Jeanna Smialek with Bloomberg Television.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,But you’re only forecasting a moderate overshoot on the fed funds rate beyond your longer-run value.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,So the countercyclical capital buffer gives us the ability to raise capital requirements on the largest institutions when financial stability vulnerabilities are meaningfully above normal.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"And then my second question is, there’s been a lot of talk lately in Congress about the ability for banks to serve marijuana businesses, and I was wondering if you think that banks should be able to serve those businesses in states where marijuana is legal."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"First of all, on the countercyclical capital buffer, I was wondering, what are the chances that the Fed is going to need to use that in the next year or two?"
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,I have a couple of regulatory questions.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,VICTORIA GUIDA.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"You know, we—I think we have to be practical about the way we think about these things and we do that by being grounded in the data and what we see happening in the real economy."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"We have to be, you know—we can’t do—we can’t be too attached to these unobservable variables."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"Some people are in the low 4s, and, again, I said the uncertainty bands are, you know, not quite a full percentage point on either side, but ¾ of a percent, that kind of thing, so it’s very possible."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"Although, you know, there’s a range of views, you know."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"You know, the best estimate that we have, over the longer run, is that."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,We may find that out.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,It may be.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"Yeah, it may be."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,You guys moved the median unemployment forecast for 2020 down to 3.5 percent but left the longer-run at 4.5 percent today.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,If I could just follow up really quickly.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,JEANNA SMIALEK.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"So if we thought that inflation were going to take off, obviously, we’d be showing higher rates, but that’s not what we think will happen."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,And their assessments generally are to support maximum employment and stable prices around 2 percent.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"And so each person who’s submitting them is submitting accommodate—you know, appropriate monetary policy that fits with that person’s assessment."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,So that’s—that’s what—so it’s important to know that the—the unemployment rate forecasts go with the inflation forecasts and go with the rate forecasts.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"So there’s no sense that inflation will—no sense in our models, or in our projections, or forecasts—that inflation will take off or move unexpectedly quickly from these levels, even if unemployment does remain low."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"If you—if you look at the forecast, two years from now, end of 2020, you’re still seeing inflation very close to target."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"So it’s not so simple as thinking, oh boy, we’ve just got to go ahead and get that rate up."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,So it’s moved down by more than a full percentage point since 2012.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"First, we’re learning about the real location of the natural rate of unemployment as we go."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"I would just—would—I would just emphasize, emphasize that—a couple things."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,How are you going to get unemployment from 3.5 percent up to that 4.5 percent rate?
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"Then why, I guess, would the longer-run unemployment rate not be a little bit lower and closer to that 2020 number?"
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,So that’s the range of estimates of the nominal neutral rate of interest.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"And I’m wondering if you or the Committee has thought about your move to raise interest rates as partly responding to the economy, but partly giving yourselves room to navigate in the inevitable future recession, whenever that was to come."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"You asked, is the—is the neutral rate moving up because of fiscal policy?"
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"But, again, I don’t think we see it as—I think there are a range of views on that, but we are watching nonfinancial corporates."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"But defaults are low, interest rates are low, you know, so it’s something— that’s something we’re watching very carefully."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"If you ask about nonfinancial corporates, that’s really where leverage is at levels that are high relative to history."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"Or, to say it differently, their capital is significantly higher."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"With—if you take banks, then, of course, their leverage is significantly lower."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"And that really was where the problems were before the financial crisis, was particularly in—among household borrowing, particularly around mortgages."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,So not so much households.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"So if you look at households, you do not see excess credit growth, you don’t see high levels of credit going out."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,Is that something that you’re worried about?
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,Are we in a credit bubble?
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,Consumer debt is rising.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,Corporate debt is up.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,Companies are buying back their shares at a record rate.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"Households are in good shape, though, and that is—that is so important because that’s where—you know, that’s where we got into trouble before."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,Nancy Marshall-Genzer with Marketplace.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"And there’s a— there may be a signal in that long-term rate about what is the neutral rate, and I think that’s why people are paying attention to the yield curve."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"So—but I think ultimately, you know, what we’re—what we really care about is what’s the appropriate stance of policy."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"In a risk-off environment, people want to own U.S. Treasuries, and you see—you know, Treasury prices go up, rates go down quite a lot."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"addition, I think what you saw most recently that you referred to, Steve, was just risk-on, risk- off."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,In 1 Chairman Powell intended to say that there are pockets of people in the United States who have not yet experienced the economic recovery.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,And so arguments are made that a flatter yield curve has less of a signal embedded in it.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"There’s the term premium, which has been very low by historical standards."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"Of course, there’s an embedded expectation of the path of short rates."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,And there are many things that move long rates around.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"I think you asked—the harder question is, what’s happening with long rates?"
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,It makes all the sense in the world that the short end would come up.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,It’s because we’re raising the federal funds rate.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,We know why—we know why the yield curve is flattening.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"That’s really what—when people are talking about the slope of the yield curve, that’s really what they’re talking about."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,And what are the consequences of being above or below it?
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"And that’s—it’s often around property, and particularly housing, where you see real problems emerge."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,MYLES UDLAND.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"We don’t expect to have to do this often or again, but we’re not sure about that."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"But, again, we don’t really have the tools that will address the distribution of profits and that kind of thing."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"And, you know, over time, when—when labor markets are strong and companies are hiring, we should see higher wages."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,I think we take that obligation very seriously.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,And so I think we’ve been committed to that.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"So we view maximum employment as the maximum sustainable level of employment, meaning it’s not so much that it will cause the economy to overheat."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,That’s our mandate.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,The part that we focus on is maximum employment.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"You know, the part—and, you know, we don’t play a role in those decisions."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,They can pay their workers.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"They can distribute it to their shareholders, they can buy—either through dividends or through buybacks."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,If companies choose to—companies in our system are free to do what they can—what they need to do once they’ve—once they’ve made profits and have cash to distribute.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"You know, we don’t—we don’t have the tools to control that."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"We don’t really see that now, so we take some solace from that."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,Thank you.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,You talked earlier about wage growth and your basic message to workers.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,Mark Hamrick with Bankrate.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,MARK HAMRICK.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"And so I think it’s more just—we’re just looking at the economy, and what does it need, and how do we— how do we sustain the expansion, keep the labor market strong, and try to keep inflation near 2 percent?"
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"I think we’re far enough away now, though, that the risks are kind of balanced."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"If you’re—if you’re worried about going back to the lower bound, then risk management would suggest that you go a little slower in raising rates and tolerate—that’s likely to be a more sustainable strategy to get further away from the zero lower bound."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"So the best thing you can do, I think—I think the incentives actually run in the other direction."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"If you raise rates too quickly, you’re just increasing the likelihood of a recession, and that’s exactly what you don’t want to do."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,So it doesn’t play any part in my thinking and I’ll tell you why.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"Or is it, you know, just a purely based on what the economy is doing?"
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"And do you think that that has played any part in, you know, your outlook for policy or recent policy decisions?"
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"Chair Powell, you referenced a minute ago this idea of cushion, or the fact that the Fed doesn’t have as much of when rates are low and inflation is low."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,Myles Udland with Yahoo Finance.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"How confident are you that when we do see stock buybacks and the like, the workers will get whatever your view of that share is as well and the wage hikes in the near term and in the foreseeable future?"
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,How do we know where it is?
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,How do we understand what the neutral rate is?
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"I think that that discussion is really about what is appropriate policy, and how do we think about policy as we approach the neutral rate."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,It’s a characterization about where policy is.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"I mean, the real message is that you’re getting close to the neutral rate."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,And I think that the market will understand that.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"We kind of don’t think it’s here yet, but it’s certainly coming."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,We know that’s coming.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"And, at that point, it would no longer be accurate for us to say that the Committee thinks that policy is accommodative."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"As the economy has recovered, we’ve been gradually raising rates and we will—we will be at a place relatively soon when, again, assuming we stay on this path, when interest rates will be in the zone of what FOMC participants think is roughly neutral."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"And, you know, as I mentioned earlier, for a long time, the economy has needed accommodative monetary policy."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,We really—our approach to policy hasn’t changed.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,That’s what happens.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"So language gets in the statement and then, you know, the economy changes."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"As you know, we made a—we made a significant number of changes at this meeting."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,We look at all the language.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"Yes, that is—that is something that we discuss."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"It’s not a statement, really, that should upset the markets."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,And could this change in the vocabulary make the market nervous?
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,Have you talked during the meeting about when the Fed is going to remove or change the word “accommodative” that describe the monetary policy for almost 10 years?
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,Virginie Montet with Agence France-Presse.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,VIRGINIE MONTET.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,It’s worth noting that the last two business cycles didn’t end with high inflation—they ended with financial instability—so that’s something we need to also keep our eye on.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,And inflation is really important.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"You’ve got to look at—you’ve got to look at all of the indicators in the economy and look at inflation, look at unemployment, look at what’s happening in the job market."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"Well, I think you have to look at inflation."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,How will we know?
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"But, yes, that should put upward pressure on it."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,It’s one of these unobserved variables so it’s very hard to—we shouldn’t try to speak about it with a— with a lot of precision or confidence.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"Again, though, they were estimating these things."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"I mean, there’s—there should be an effect if you have increased deficits that should put upward pressure on, you know, a few tenths, let’s say."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,Yes.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,And have you thought already at some options so to know how you’re going to call it down the road?
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"But, you know, we’ll obviously discuss it carefully in meetings and communicate about it."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,So.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,NAOATSU AOYAMA.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"It’s—but it’s only one of many things, of course, that we talk about."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,It’s something we’re going to continue to be talking about.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,And I—you have a range of views.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"I mean, I— the yield curve is something that people are talking about a lot, including FOMC participants."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,So let me—let me briefly mention the yield curve.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,And what does it say about the inflation outlook as well?
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,How do you account for the fact that long rates have been so slow to rise?
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"About financial conditions, which worries you more—warnings that rising short-term rates are bringing the yield curve closer to inversion, or the fact that long rates have risen very slowly and, in fact, are nearly 20 basis points below their recent high?"
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"Steve Beckner, Mr. Chairman, freelance journalist reporting for NPR."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"We’re well aware that there are pockets out there of people who have not felt the recession yet, but, broadly speaking, it’s a good economy.1 STEVEN BECKNER."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,But most people who want a job can find one.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"It hasn’t reached everyone, let’s be clear on that."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,We see a very strong economy across a bunch of fronts.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"And I also—as I also mentioned, we don’t see it in the numbers yet."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,There is —there is concern that trade changes could be disruptive.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"And, you know, I—as I mentioned earlier, we do hear from our business contacts, which are extensive in the United States, and we do report on that in the minutes, and I’ve just mentioned what those are."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,Thank you very much.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"Naoatsu Aoyama from the Asahi Shimbun, Japan’s newspaper."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"Would you expand on the—on your views on the downside risks—downside risks, especially in regard to trade issues?"
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,Many people are—in the key allies of the United States—are concerned that the United States may destabilize the underpinnings of the international liberal order the United States has created and built up in the postwar environment.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"So—and that will, of course, have a very negative economic implications for the global economy as well as the U.S. economy."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,So would you—have you—can I have your views on that?
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"And we do understand that there’s high uncertainty around the level, but that’s kind of—so you can think of 2.9 as being—which is sort of a full percentage point away from where fed funds is going to trade after today’s decision."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"So, you know, as I mentioned earlier, I’m really committed to staying in our lane on things."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"We have very important jobs assigned to us by Congress and that’s maximum employment, stable prices, financial stability."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,Trade is explicitly assigned to the executive branch by Congress and not to us.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,So we don’t really—we don’t really seek to play a role in trade policy.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,We’re not at that table.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,Those are—those powers and decisions are given to others and so we want to stick to what we do.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,Sure.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"And we’ve said in our, you know, basic documents that we will adjust the use of our tools, as appropriate."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,We really don’t.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"That’s the whole, the whole idea."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,So that’s how the Committee generally is thinking about—about fiscal policy.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"There’s also the possibility that there would be more labor supply from lower individual tax rates, again, in amounts and in timing that might be more uncertain."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,I think the amounts and the timing of that coming in are also quite uncertain.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,So that really ought to happen as well.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,That should increase potential output.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,That should drive productivity.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"So it is—it makes sense that if you lower corporate tax rates and allow faster expensing of investment, you will encourage greater investment."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"And the question—the other question is, what about the supply side?"
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"But I can say that the Committee members—Committee participants—generally believe that the fiscal changes—and that includes both the tax cuts, individual and corporate, and the spending changes—will provide meaningful support to demand, significant support to demand over the course of the next three years."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"You also asked about fiscal policy, and there’s a range of views on the Committee and, I think more broadly, a range of views among economists generally."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"So we continue to think, and the Committee continues to think, that we are just about at our 2 percent goal but, as I mentioned, not ready to declare victory until we sustain that over time, which we haven’t done yet."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,Part of it is just that continued tightening in the labor market and the economy more broadly is pushing inflation up.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"And part of that has been just idiosyncratic things dropping out from last March, which were holding inflation—measured inflation—down."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,We’ve seen inflation move very gradually up toward our 2 percent objective.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,NICK TIMIRAOS.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,So since—I wouldn’t say anything has happened since March to really change the way I’m thinking about inflation or the way the Committee’s thinking about inflation.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"And, on growth, you mentioned fiscal policy is adding to growth, and I’m curious if you could break that down a little bit further for us and say—what effects do you think the recent tax cuts are having on growth?"
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"On inflation, I’m curious if there’s anything that’s happened since March that has changed your assessment of the risk of inflation increases beyond what you forecast in the year to come."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,I have a question about inflation and a question about growth.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"Jim Tankersley, New York Times."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"Hi, Mr. Chairman."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,JIM TANKERSLEY.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"Thanks for listening, and I’ll be happy to take your questions."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,This minor technical adjustment has no bearing on the appropriate path for the federal funds rate or financial conditions more generally.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"So to move the federal funds rate closer to the middle of the target range, we are now setting the IOER rate 5 basis points below the upper end of the target range."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"In recent months, the federal funds rate has moved up toward the IOER rate as short-term interest rates have risen more generally."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"Up until now, we have set the IOER rate at the top of the target range for the federal funds rate."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"To keep the federal funds rate in the target range, we rely on the rate of interest on excess reserves, or the IOER rate."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"And, finally, as discussed in the minutes of our May meeting, we’re making a small technical adjustment in one of our tools for implementing monetary policy."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,Sure.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"As we have said, changing the target range for the federal funds rate is our primary means of adjusting the stance of monetary policy."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,Thanks.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"So the Fed is about four interest rate increases, using the projections released today, away from what might be considered a neutral fed funds rate."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"You know, there are some ideas that sort of take cognizance of the fact that rates are lower, we’re near the zero lower bound, and that could put downward pressure on inflation expectations if we’re going to be down at the zero lower bound and, therefore, sort of undermine the credibility of the 2 percent inflation objective."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,You asked about price-level targeting and that sort of thing.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"The sort of barriers to making a material change to that would be—would be very high because, again, we think it’s fundamental, and we think it’s worked."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,The Committee is strongly committed to it.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"We feel that that target has served the economy well, and I’m strongly committed to it."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"You know, the—our target for—our medium-term objective for inflation is 2 percent PCE inflation."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"In deciding how symmetric is too symmetric, what sort of parameters are you using on that front?"
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"2.1 percent above target for two and a half years starts to feel like some of the alternate frameworks that have been discussed here, be it price-level targeting or trying to set expectations higher so that you hit your 2."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,Howard Schneider with Reuters.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,HOWARD SCHNEIDER.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,So I think we— we’ll be guided by incoming data on the economy and try to keep our minds open as we move forward.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,What is that rate of interest that pushes neither up nor down?
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"But also, what is the neutral rate of interest?"
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"Nick Timiraos, the Wall Street Journal."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"We have to acknowledge that there are always wide uncertainty bands around the level of, for example, the natural rate of unemployment."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"And, you know, I—you asked, how will we know?"
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"And, really, it boils down to a question of, what is appropriate policy?"
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"So the Committee is discussing, very actively, the questions that you raise."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,We don’t have an exact sense of how that will be.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,So we know that we’re getting closer to that neutral level.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,Neutral meaning that interest rates are neither pushing the economy up nor trying to restrain it.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,How will you know where—at what point policy will be neutral?
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,And how will you know?
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"As the economy has strengthened and as we’ve gradually raised interest rates, the question comes into view of, how much longer will you need to be accommodative?"
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"So for many, many years, we’ve been far from maximum employment and stable prices, and so the need for accommodative policy has been—has been clear."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,And under what conditions would you want to keep going?
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"Under what conditions would you decide, once you get there, that it’s okay to stop raising rates?"
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,And I wanted to ask how you’re thinking about what to do once you get to neutral.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"So I think we’ll be very carefully looking at incoming data on inflation, on financial readings, and on the labor market."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,So the idea is to have kind of a makeup.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"Barring a material and unexpected weakening in the outlook, this program will proceed on schedule, and our balance sheet will continue to shrink."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,I’ll conclude by mentioning two additional matters.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"The median projection for the growth of real GDP is 2.8 percent this year, 2.4 percent next year, and 2 percent in 2020."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,These observations are consistent with the projections that Committee participants submitted for this meeting.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"Several factors support this assessment: Fiscal policy is boosting the economy, ongoing job gains are raising incomes and confidence, foreign economies continue to expand, and overall financial conditions remain accommodative."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"Business investment continues to grow strongly, and the overall outlook for growth remains favorable."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"Economic growth appears to have picked up in the current quarter, largely reflecting a bounceback in household spending."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"Now, let me go into more detail over developments in the economy, our economic projections, and our policy decision."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,My FOMC colleagues and I will also continue to issue our economic projections on the existing quarterly schedule.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,This change is only about improving communications.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,I want to point out that having twice as many press conferences does not signal anything about the timing or pace of future interest rate changes.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,That will give us more opportunities to explain our actions and to answer your questions.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,And we’re going to do that beginning in January.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,And one practical step in doing so is to have a press conference like this after every one of our scheduled FOMC meetings.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"As Chairman, I hope to foster a public conversation about what the Fed is doing to support a strong and resilient economy."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"To that end, we try to give a sense of our expectations for how the economy will evolve and how our policy stance may change."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"Compared with the projections made in March, this median growth path is little changed."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,We think the outcomes are likely to be better overall if we are as clear as possible about what we are likely to do and why.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"We don’t put our interest rate decisions on hold or on autopilot, because the economy can always evolve in unexpected ways."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,My colleagues and I meet eight times a year and take a fresh look each time at what is happening in the economy and consider whether our policy needs adjusting.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"Today, we’ve taken another step in that process by raising our target range for the federal funds rate by ¼ of a percentage point."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"In particular, we think that gradually returning interest rates to a more normal level as the economy strengthens is the best way the Fed can help sustain an environment in which American households and businesses can thrive."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"For the past few years, we have been gradually raising interest rates, and along the way we’ve tried to explain the reasoning behind our decisions."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,Interest rates have been low for some years while the economy has been recovering from the financial crisis.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"Most people who want to find jobs are finding them, and unemployment and inflation are low."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,The main takeaway is that the economy is doing very well.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"But because monetary policy affects everyone, I want to start with a plain-English summary of how the economy is doing, what my colleagues and I at the Federal Reserve are trying to do, and why."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"I know that a number of you will want to talk about the details of our announcement today, and I am happy to do that in a few minutes."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,Thanks very much for being here.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,Good afternoon.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"Transcript of Chairman Powell’s Press Conference June 13, 2018 CHAIRMAN POWELL."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,IOER is the principal tool by which we assure that that will happen.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,History has shown that moving interest rates either too quickly or too slowly can lead to bad economic outcomes.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"First, our program for reducing our balance sheet, which began in October, is proceeding smoothly."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"In the labor market, job gains averaged 180,000 per month over the past three months, well above the pace needed in the longer run to provide jobs for new entrants into the workforce."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"Meanwhile, the labor force participation rate has been roughly unchanged since late 2013."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"Although the median federal funds rate edged up this year and next, most participants did not revise their projections."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"By 2020, the median federal funds rate is modestly above its estimated longer-run level."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"The median projection for the federal funds rate is 2.4 percent at the end of this year, 3.1 percent at the end of 2019, and 3.4 percent at the end of 2020."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,The Committee’s gradual approach is reflected in participants’ projections for the appropriate path for the federal funds rate.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"Conversely, if we raise interest rates too rapidly, the economy could weaken, and inflation could continue to run persistently below our objective."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"We are aware that raising rates too slowly might raise the risk that monetary policy would need to tighten abruptly down the road in response to an unexpectedly sharp increase in inflation or financial excesses, jeopardizing the economic expansion."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"We continue to believe that a gradual approach for increasing the federal funds rate will best promote a sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near our symmetric 2 percent goal."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"Therefore, we thought that now is an appropriate time to remove this forward guidance from our policy statement."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"As a result, if the economy evolves broadly as we anticipate, the federal funds rate will, over the next year or so, move well within the range of estimates of the normal long-run level."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"As we continue to note in our statement, we expect to make further gradual increases in that rate."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"For example, we removed the language stating that “the federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run.” Since we introduced that language a few years ago, the economy has strengthened, and the Committee has raised the federal funds rate from near 0 to 1¾ to 2 percent."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,None of these changes signals a change in our policy views.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"We also made some changes to our policy statement, reflecting that policy normalization is proceeding broadly as we have expected."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"As I mentioned, today we took another step in gradually scaling back monetary policy accommodation by raising the target range for the federal funds rate by ¼ percentage point, bringing it to 1¾ to 2 percent."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"The unemployment rate declined over the past two months and stood at 3.8 percent in May, its lowest level in nearly two decades."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"Relative to the March projections, the median inflation projection is a little higher this year and next."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"But that transitory development should have little, if any, consequence for inflation over the next few years."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"For example, the recent rise in oil prices will likely push inflation somewhat above 2 percent in coming months."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"Of course, many factors affect inflation—some temporary and others more lasting—and at any given time inflation may be above or below 2 percent."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"As we note in our Statement of Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, the Committee would be concerned if inflation were running persistently above or below our 2 percent objective."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,We want to ensure that inflation remains near our symmetric 2 percent longer-run goal on a sustained basis.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"The recent inflation data have been encouraging, but after many years of inflation below our objective, we do not want to declare victory."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"As we had expected, inflation moved up as the unusually low readings from last March dropped out of the calculation."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"The core PCE index, which excludes prices of energy and food and tends to be a better indicator of future inflation, rose 1.8 percent over the same period."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"Indeed, overall consumer prices, as measured by the price index for personal consumption expenditures, increased 2 percent over the 12 months ending in April."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"After many years of running below our 2 percent longer-run objective, inflation has recently moved close to that level."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,This median path is just a bit lower than that from March.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"As you can see in our Summary of Economic Projections, the median of Committee participants’ projections for the unemployment rate stands at 3.6 percent in the fourth quarter of this year and runs at 3.5 percent over the next two years, a percentage point below the median estimate of its longer-run normal rate."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,And we expect the job market to remain strong.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"That is a positive sign, given that the aging of our population is putting downward pressure on the participation rate."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,The median of participants’ projections for inflation runs at 2.1 percent through 2020.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"If you—if you’re below target for a while, you have a—you have a time of being above target."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,These projections are very similar to those made in March.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,This is an idea that’s been written about for many years.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,Just a follow-up on—Don Lee from the L.A. Times.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,DON LEE.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"Our role, though, is also to, you know, to make sure that—that maximum employment happens in a context of price stability and financial stability, which is why we’re gradually raising rates."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"So there are a lot of things to really like, including higher wages, as you asked."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,Society benefits from that.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,They benefit from that.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"You’ll see people at the, sort of, the margins of the labor force having an opportunity to get back in work."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,You will see wages go up.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"And one of the things is—you will see—pretty much people who want to get jobs—not everybody—but people who want to get jobs, many of them will be able to get jobs."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"And, frankly, I do think there’s a lot to like about low unemployment."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"I wouldn’t say it’s a mystery, but it’s a bit of a puzzle."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,So it’s a bit of a puzzle.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"But, nonetheless, I think we had anticipated, and many people have anticipated, that wages—that in a world where we’re hearing lots and lots about labor shortages—everywhere we go now, we hear about labor shortages—but where is the wage reaction?"
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"Part of that can be explained by low productivity, which is something we’ve talked about at the Committee and elsewhere."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"On both inflation and unemployment, the new projections—for unemployment lower than before and inflation higher."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"I think it’s fair to say that some of us—and I certainly would have expected wages to react more to the very significant reduction in unemployment that we’ve had, as I mentioned, from 10 percent to 3.8 percent."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"You know, wages have been gradually moving up."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"I know you’re forecasting a little bit more inflation, but is that going to translate through to wage growth?"
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,Are we finally going to see that wage growth pickup this year?
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,Can you give us an update on what the FOMC thinks about wages?
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,Heather Long from the Washington Post.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"Hi, Chair Powell."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,HEATHER LONG.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"And it’s been clear that as we’ve gotten closer to our statutory goals, we should normalize policy, and that’s really what we’ve been consistently doing for some years now."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"For many years, as I mentioned—many years—we had interest rates held low to support economic activity."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"Growth is strong, labor markets are strong, inflation is close to target, and that’s what you’re seeing."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,So really what you—the decision you see today is another sign that the U.S. economy is in great shape.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,It’s 3.8 percent now and moving lower.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,We— unemployment was 10 percent at the height of the crisis.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"Earlier in the recovery, they were—there are many different wage measures, of course, but—so just—but just to generalize, wages were running roughly around 2 percent and they’ve moved gradually up into between 2 to 3 percent as the labor market has become stronger and stronger."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,And how much is the Fed willing to accept that’s an overshoot for both of those before it affects policy?
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,You mentioned that unemployment moved down and inflation moved up by truly small amounts.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"If you look at the Summary of Economic Projections, things are moving by just a tick or even a semitick between now and March."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,So I would say that—remember the important thing is that we want the federal funds rate to trade in the target range.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,And the idea is to enhance the credibility of that 2 percent—that 2 percent target.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,Thanks.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,Thank you.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"Is it purely technical, perhaps related to bill issuance, or is it telling you something about the level of scarcity and truly excess bank reserves?"
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"And, further, was there discussion among the Committee today about what’s causing that?"
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,Do you think that that’s going to resolve that issue or might there be further action required by the Committee in the future to continue lowering IOER relative to the midpoint of the range?
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"And you mentioned, of course, that—that the IOER was raised by the Committee 20 basis points, and that’s a result, as you said, of the upward drift of the effective fed funds rate in that target range."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"Mr. Chairman, I have a couple questions about the interest the Fed pays on excess reserves."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"Chris Condon, Bloomberg News."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,CHRISTOPHER CONDON.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,And that can also have bad outcomes.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"And the other is moving too slowly, and then we have—we have too much inflation or financial instability, and we have to raise quickly."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,One would be moving too quickly—inflation never gets back to target if we do that.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"We’re going ahead and moving gradually and trying to navigate between two risks, really."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,We’re not waiting for inflation to show up.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"And you asked, you know—I mean, I think we take a longer-run view that we’re shooting for—we’re aiming for— 2 percent inflation—inflation around 2 percent."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,We know that it’ll be above or below.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"We’re not going to—we didn’t overreact, I think, to inflation being under 2 percent."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,We won’t overreact to it being over 2 percent.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"And I think we’ll always be using our tools to move inflation in the direction of the target, if it—if it leaves—if it moves away from the target persistently, as I mentioned."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"In terms of unemployment, you know, you have to acknowledge that we are—no one really knows with certainty what the level of the natural rate of unemployment is, the rate that is sustainable over a long period of time."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,The economy is in a very different place.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"And we know that probably that rate has declined as the U.S. population has become more educated, as it has become older."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,We don’t know this with precision.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,So we have to be learning as we go.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,We’ve got to be looking at data and informed by what’s coming in.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"And as I mentioned, I think at the last press conference, estimates by the—by members of the Committee have moved down by a full percentage point since maybe 2012 as we’ve learned—as unemployment has dropped and inflation hasn’t really reacted."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"So I can’t give you a precise number, but I just—you know, we will be very much informed by incoming data."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,And this uncertainty is why—the fact that we live in that uncertainty is why we’ve been gradually raising rates.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,Older and more educated people have lower unemployment rates.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"The economy has strengthened so much since I joined the Fed, you know, in 2012 and even over the last couple of years."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,Do you believe in that?
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"Is that showing us that not a single member of the Committee— including yourself, Mr. Chairman—agrees with economists over at the White House that they can achieve long-run sustained growth rates above or at 3 percent or higher?"
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"It’s 1.8 to 2, or 1.7 to 2.1, depending upon how you count it."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"Mr. Chairman, you said there’s a difference of opinion among economists, but looking at the longer-run GDP growth rates for the members of the Committee, there’s not a whole lot of difference."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"Steve Liesman, CNBC."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,STEVE LIESMAN.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,But—so I would put it down as more of a risk.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,It’s just not there.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,We really don’t see it in the numbers.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,Growth is strong.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,The labor market is strong.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,The economy is very strong.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,So right now we don’t see that in the numbers at all.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,And so they report in the Beige Book and then in person at the FOMC meeting.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"And the Reserve Bank presidents, in particular, have that."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"I will say that we, of course, have—we have broad contacts in—among business leaders around the country."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"Congress has very specifically given authority over trade to the executive branch, so I wouldn’t comment on any particular specific trade actions."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,It’s not something that the Committee has looked at seriously.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"I imagine we will be having discussions about it, but—not something that we have on the calendar right now."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,I think what you should see is that the economy is continuing to make progress.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,SAM FLEMING.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"Well, thanks very much."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,Sam Fleming from the Financial Times.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"Over the weekend, we saw some significant tensions within the G-7."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,How big a risk do you currently see this as being to the United States economy?
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,And what kind of feedback are you getting in terms of corporate investment intentions?
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,Is there something that’s beginning to feature more prominently in your own discussions with major U.S. companies?
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,Thanks.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"I ought to start by saying that, you know, Congress has assigned us very important jobs and—you know, maximum employment, stable prices, we have a role in financial stability that we share with other agencies."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"In Canada, there is the potential, obviously, for further action against China right now and retaliatory action from major U.S. trading partners."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"You know, first of all, that’s a—that’s a reasonable range, I think, of—it’s not that we’re all on the same number, but there are a range of views about potential growth."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"And they do come back and they say that concerns about changes in trade policy are arising, I think it’s fair to say, and also that you’re beginning to hear reports of companies holding off on making investments and hiring people."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,And there’s so much uncertainty around this.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,But shouldn’t we see from this combination of things that the Fed is moving to tighter policy?
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,But you say that none of this signals a change in policy views.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"At this meeting, you hiked your—the funds rate, you changed the dot plot to move from 3 to 4 for this year, and you took out a sentence that you’d been using for years about how long rates might stay low."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"Marty Crutsinger, Associated Press."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,MARTIN CRUTSINGER.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,And we just hope that that is—happens on a symmetric basis.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"We do understand, though, that we don’t have the ability to precisely hit that target, so we expect that inflation will be above or below."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"Things buffet inflation back and forth, but—so we acknowledge that, we understand that—and if inflation were to persistently run above or below 2 percent, then we would be using our tools to try to move inflation back in the direction of the target."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"For example, as I mentioned, later this summer there’s a good chance that headline inflation will move up above 2 percent because of oil prices."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,We’re looking at it equally on either side and it’s a matter of persistent overruns.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,And that’s what we mean by symmetric.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"You know, what we’ve said in our Statement of Longer-Run Principles and Monetary Policy Strategy is that the Committee would be concerned if inflation were to run persistently above or below 2 percent, persistently above or below 2 percent."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"And now that you’re planning to hold these regular press conferences, starting next year, how do you explain—how do you plan to explain that to the American people that inflation is not overrunning?"
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"Like has the Committee given any further thought in terms of how comfortable it would be rising above—whether it goes higher than 2.1, if it reaches 2.2, 2.3, and for how long?"
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,We know that inflation is going to bounce around.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,I wanted to circle back on a question that was asked at the initial press conference about what—what does the Fed say in regards to the inflation target as symmetric?
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"You know, we don’t—the thing about fiscal policy is, you don’t have thousands of incidents to, you know, to—you don’t have big data, in a way."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"You’ve got only a few instances here, so you have a lot of uncertainty around what the effects will be."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,They could be large.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,We hope they’re large.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,"But I think our approach is going to be to watch and see and hope that, in fact, we do get significant effects to, you know, to potential growth out of the tax bill, and we’re just going to have to see."
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,How would you forecast it though?
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,STEVE LIESMAN.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,I think we’re looking at a reasonable range of estimates and we’re putting every—different participants are putting different estimates in and we’re going to be waiting and seeing.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,DONNA BORAK.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,Donna Borak with CNN.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,You said earlier that it’s still a little too early to declare victory on inflation.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
2018-06-13,Press Conf - Q&A,You have very small data.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,And so I think it’s a critical power to have.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,Are you worried about the effect of rising interest rates on consumers?
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"In my mind, it should be used—my thinking, it should be used sparingly, and that means, you know, in situations where you have—I mean, in principle, you could have another Lehman Brothers come up out of the ground that’s not a bank, and it could be very threatening—or it could be capable of creating systemic risk."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"But, again, I would use it—I would tend to use it fairly sparingly."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,Nancy Marshall-Genzer with Marketplace.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,They’re still quite low by historical levels.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,Mortgage rates are up.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,What do you say to consumers?
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"Yeah, we look—of course, we look at that very carefully, and interest rates are going up across a broad range of consumer borrowing, as they would when we raise short-term interest rates."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"So you’re right that the cost of borrowing is going up, but it’s going up from what were extraordinarily low levels, and it is something that we watch carefully."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,So it’s a really important power.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"And the other thing I’ll say is, take—if you take housing, if you look at the NAR Affordability Index, housing is still more affordable now than it was before the financial crisis."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,Credit card rates have jumped to more than 17 percent since the Fed started raising interest rates.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"You know, the third thing you mentioned is the designation power."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,So we’ve done a lot.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,I have real doubts about whether it was wise to take away our crisis-fighting tools.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"You know, the effect on consumer spending is a very important channel through which interest rates work, and so we do monitor the effects."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"We raised capital, liquidity."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"And if all that doesn’t work, we’ve got resolution plans, which we’ve, you know, through many cycles, have made really substantial progress, more than I had thought was likely."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"We have stress tests, which force banks to understand—the largest banks particularly—to understand and better manage their risk and have enough capital to survive a really substantial shock that’s at least as bad as the financial crisis."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"So we—you know, we put a tremendous focus on that."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"Nobody’s—you know, nobody is, I think, overconfident that we’ve solved every problem."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"And, you know, now we’re going back and kind of taking a hard look at everything and, you know, trying to make—trying to—trying to keep at it."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"So I think those are the really important lessons, and, you know, we—we’re determined not to, you know, not to forget them."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"And that’s, I think, a risk now—is to—is to forget things that we—that we learned."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,That’s just human nature over time.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"I saw the article you’re talking about; the question is, did Congress take things away, emergency powers from the Fed?"
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"So there was sort of a trade for taking away our power under 13, section 13(3), to provide support to individual nonbanks, which is really holding companies and other companies."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"In exchange for that, we got orderly liquidation authority and a resolution authority."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,Was it a mistake?
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,I don’t think there’s any sense that Congress would seriously look at changing that.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"I think you put them away, and you hope you never need them, but—and I certainly strongly oppose efforts to take away more of our tools."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,HANNAH LANG.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,PAUL KIERNAN.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,OCC’s decision to go at CRA alone suggests that there’s some sort of disagreement among how to proceed with a joint plan.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"It’s a tenth we’re talking about here, so—but still, I think it’s a positive thing that people could be raising their estimates of the longer-run neutral rate and potentially the longer-run growth rate."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,Who knows?
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"And maybe reducing their level of the natural rate of unemployment, which has been the trend."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,It’s just that you change those estimates over time.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,They’re informed by incoming data.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"They don’t change a lot, though, although they did—it’s interesting that the neutral rate changed quite sharply after the financial crisis in many different models, and it’s been slow to recover."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,And you’re right—we actually—the median ticked up a tenth.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"I don’t expect a dramatic recovery there, but, you know, we—we’re so bad at forecasting productivity."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,So I think we have to be humble about how little we really know about where these starred value variables either are or are going.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"Hi, Chairman."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,Paul Kiernan from Dow Jones Newswires.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"So I think if you look—if you look back at the way the models worked and the way people thought about risk in the economy, that’s what was missing, and I think it’s not missing anymore."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,I’d like to just kind of ask again—you mentioned earlier that gradual—a gradual pace of rate increases will make it easier to react.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,Thank you for taking the question.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,It’s just very hard to know when productivity is going to arrive and in what quantity.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"I think we all look at them—those of us who file SEPs every quarter will look at that every quarter and not make a change every quarter but, every now and again, make a change."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,So they move quite slowly through time.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"In the case of the funds rate, it’s more—it’s productivity—it’s appetite for safe assets and demographics and other things, too."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"What are the issues that are preventing a joint plan from developing, and how close are you to a possible joint plan?"
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"Well, at the Fed, we are, you know, deeply committed to the mission of CRA, which is for banks to provide credit and other banking services in the communities they serve."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"And we have also been of the view for some time that with the evolution of technology particularly and changes—changes in the nature of banking, that it’s an appropriate time—it’s past an appropriate time, but now it’s certainly an appropriate time to revisit the way we think about CRA."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"But we don’t want to lose that focus on community, and, you know, we definitely want to see that fundamental purpose of the law sustained."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"Many of the issues that we had were reflected in the OCC’s ANPR, and we’re—we’re hopeful that, over time, there will be a joint proposed rulemaking with the OCC, the FDIC, and the Fed."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"It’s a process, and, you know, we’re very much interested in continuing to push it forward."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,STEVE BECKNER.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"Steve Beckner, freelance journalist filing for NPR."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"Mr. Chairman, following up on the neutral rate issue—and you touched on this—but, you know, you and your colleagues slightly lifted the longer-run estimate, the neutral funds rate estimate to 3 percent, but that’s still, I believe, like 125 basis points below where it was six years ago."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"What are the odds that productivity, you know, investment, productivity, labor market, other developments could further push up the longer-run estimate and possibly make the projected funds rate levels less restrictive than they now seem?"
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"So, in principle, the—these starred variables—the long-run growth rate of the economy, the neutral rate of interest, the natural rate of unemployment—don’t move quickly."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,They move very gradually.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"They’re pinned down by longer-run forces, like demographics."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"Hi, Hannah Lang, American Banker."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"The first thing is the single biggest thing I think that we learned was the—as I mentioned, I think, earlier, the importance of maintaining the stability of the financial system."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"Yeah, you know, it’s—if you look at a broad financial conditions index, that’s pretty much the answer you’ll get."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"I will say that I’m very happy and excited about the team that we’re putting together, and I’m very much looking forward to having those offices up and down our hall filled."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"It’s been pretty quiet, more quieter than usual, which is saying something on the Board hall."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,So we’re looking forward to getting some people confirmed.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"In terms of corporate debt, so this is a—this is a—you know, I was an investor for a long time in areas that were very close to the leveraged lending markets."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"So, you know, I have had a lot of experience in that."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,That market has evolved really significantly since before the crisis.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"But these are—these are really decisions for the White House, and, you know, we are—think of us as just being consulted."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"And, you know, the banks take much less risk than they used to."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"But it’s also true—and there’s significant research on this—that excessive risk-taking in the leveraged lending markets does have channels for affecting the real economy, if there’s overheating and that kind of thing in those markets, so we monitor that carefully."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"You know, the guidance is—isn’t binding, as you pointed out, that the leveraged lending isn’t binding, and that’s just—that’s just the way that the law is interpreted."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"So it’s something we’re monitoring, and, as I mentioned, we think overall vulnerabilities are moderate."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,BINYAMIN APPELBAUM.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"Binya Appelbaum, the New York Times."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"If I could come back to “accommodative,” do you think of policy as accommodative at present?"
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"They’re—the—they’re essentially in the business of distributing these loans and bonds rather than keeping them on their balance sheet, to a much greater degree."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"And traditionally, the Fed Chair has been consulted on those, and I’m happy to say that that has continued."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"Okay, so in terms of nominations to the Fed, those are entirely, completely under the control of the White House and, ultimately, the President."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"Well, that—you know, that purpose has been well served, and the language now doesn’t really say anything that’s important to the way the Committee is thinking about policy going forward."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"But, specifically, what are you going to be looking to see, because you’ve also mentioned, you know, that monetary policy operates with a lag, so any kind of specific signposts that maybe we’ve reached the end of the tightening cycle or where we should stop?"
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,That’s why that came out.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,Did I get— did I get all of your ques—?
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,MICHAEL MCKEE.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,The idea that financial conditions remain loose even though you raised rates 200 basis points?
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"We don’t control that, and, as I mentioned earlier, we do take financial conditions into account in what we do."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"And financial conditions are affecting the broader economy, so, by definition, we’re taking them into account."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"But if you look at—look at interest rates, you know, interest rates—look at long-term interest rates this year and short-term interest rates this year, there’s very significant increases."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"And, you know, with your long and variable lags, that should be—that should be having an effect over time."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,VICTORIA GUIDA.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"Hi, Victoria Guida with Politico."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"So Nellie Liang was just put forward by President Donald Trump to the Fed Board, and I was just curious, you know, given that she’s a longtime veteran of the Fed, whether you could speak to what role you played in, you know, recommending candidates to the President, giving input on who he should nominate."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"And then also, if I—if I may follow up on the financial stability discussion from earlier, you know, you’ve mentioned before that corporate debt is at high levels, and I was curious whether, you know, you have any qualms about loosening up restrictions on leveraged lending by making that guidance less of a—less of a cudgel, I guess, while—at a time when leveraged lending is gaining steam?"
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"How close are you to neutrality, and do you share the view of some of your colleagues that you’ll eventually need to be restrictive?"
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"So, three things there."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"So I think if you look at the—look at the dot plot in the SEP, you’ll see that the federal funds rate, even after today’s move, is below the longer-run neutral estimate of every single participant that—who submits a— an estimate of that."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,Maybe we’ve underestimated the neutral rate.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"Maybe we’ll be raising our estimate of the neutral rate and we’ll just go to that, or maybe we’ll keep our neutral rate here and then go one or two rate increases beyond it."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"I think it’s very possible, but I mean, ultimately, isn’t really the question we’re answering."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"The question we’re answering is, how do we provide the economy just the right amount of support— not too much, not too little—to sustain the recovery and achieve our statutory goals?"
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,GREG ROBB.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,It depends on if we keep going—you can think of it different ways.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,Greg Robb from MarketWatch.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,I was wondering if you thought there were any lessons from the crisis that you want to share—and two points on that.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,You go to Congress a lot and talk to members of Congress.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"Now, Secretary Paulson and Mr. Geithner and Chair Bernanke have said that Congress made a mistake when it took away the Fed’s emergency powers in Dodd-Frank."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"And then one other thing is that, are you confident that all these nonbanks didn’t—you know, nonbanks never got put into the, you know, the FSOC, you know, system."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,So are you confident that the—you can see the risks in the financial system?
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,Thank you.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,The 10-year anniversary of the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers got a lot of attention over the last month.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"You know, it—I would just say, you know, it really depends on what happens."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"And, as I mentioned, many of the participants have written that down, and they’ve written down really modest overshoots, you know, amounting to one rate hike kind of thing, which wouldn’t have a big effect on the economy."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,It happens often.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"So that’s why this is the perfect time to take the language out, because, you know, it’s perfectly clear that there can’t be a signal because, you know, by definition, that means an accommodative policy."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,So it wasn’t because policy is not accommodative.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,It is still accommodative.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"The thinking was more, as I mentioned, it’s more that the language has run its useful life."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"There’s another point, though, too, which is, you know, we don’t want to suggest either that we have this precise understanding of where “accommodative” stops or suggest that that’s a really important point in our thinking."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"You know, what we’re going to be doing, assuming we stay on this path, is, we’re going to be carefully monitoring incoming data from the financial markets and from the economy and asking ourselves whether our policy is achieving the goals we want to achieve—you know, sustain the economy, maximum employment, stable prices."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"That’s the way we’re thinking about it, and that does kind of amount to thinking less about one’s precise point estimate of the neutral rate."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,So that’s how I think about that.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,BINYAMIN APPELBAUM.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"The second question was, do you think you’re going to end up in a restrictive posture?"
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"Governor Brainard, for example, has said that she expects that you will need to do that."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,Do you agree with that?
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,It’s possible.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,It’s very possible.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"Okay, so are we accommodative now?"
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"Secondly, if you worry about the divergence between interest rates in the U.S. and internationally, especially at a time when emerging markets are under pressure."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"One thing that’s changed since the crisis is, the majority of mortgages issued last year came from so-called nonbank lenders, as traditional banks scaled back."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"Oh, to stop."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,TAKESHI KAWANAMI.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,.

2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"Well, we serve a domestic mandate, which is assigned to us by Congress, and that is to have maximum employment and stable prices."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"About half of global GDP is outside the United States, and way more than half of the growth is outside the United States and in emerging markets, I should say."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"And so the performance in the emerging market economies really, really matters to us in carrying out our domestic mandate."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"I’d also say that, you know, a strong U.S. economy, where Americans are buying things and the economy is growing and our—you know, that’s going to support demand all around the globe, so that’s a good thing."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"Now, we do understand, though, that when we—when our economy is strong and we’re raising rates, that puts upward pressure on interest rates around the world and can affect countries, particularly countries that have significant external dollar borrowing."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,hike.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,There is a possibility to stop the .
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,TAKESHI KAWANAMI.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"Sorry, the second question was?"
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,And so—and I—my plan is to kind of stick to the same approach and stay in our lane.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"And, you know—so I would just say, it’s—it’s no secret, it’s been true for a long time that with our uniquely expensive health-care delivery system and the aging of our population, we’ve been on an unsustainable fiscal path for a long time, and there’s no hiding from it."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"In the end, we will have to face that, and I think, you know, the sooner, the better."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"And also, these are good times."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"These are, you know, this is—this is the economy at nearly full employment or in the range—in the neighborhood of full employment."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,Interest rates are low.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,It’s a—it’s a good time to be addressing these things.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,So I just—I put that out there and leave it at that.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,TAKESHI KAWANAMI.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,I’m Takeshi Kawanami from Nikkei newspaper.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,Thank you for taking my question.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,I’d like to ask about emerging markets.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"What do you think about impact of U.S. monetary policy on emerging markets—interest rate, currency depreciation, or capital outflow from emerging countries?"
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,And do you think there is a possibility to stop the interest rate hike due to emerging markets turmoil—due to turmoil in emerging markets?
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,And what we try to do is be very transparent about what we’re doing and why.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"And we have been, I believe, and we’ve also moved quite gradually."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"So I—you know, I think we’ve been performing well on that front."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"There are some countries that are—that are undergoing severe stress, a handful of them, and—but not most emerging market countries."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,Mark Hamrick with Bankrate.com.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"You know, we put that in the statement in 2015, just when we lifted off, and the idea was to provide assurance that we weren’t trying to slow down the economy, but, in fact, we were still—interest rates were still going to be pushing to support economic activity."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"What confidence do you have about supervision and, I suppose, also regulation in this space given the role of housing finance in the crisis?"
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,Thank you.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,It’s a good question.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,So you’re right that a lot of mortgages are now originated outside the system.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"Many of those, though, have to meet certain basic standards to be bought by the GSEs."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"I think we—if we look at mortgage credit more broadly, though, what we see is that credit is pretty widely available to people with high scores and with good credit— good credit records, and much, much less available than it was before the crisis to people with low scores and perhaps troubled credit history."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"You know, it’s—have we—have we set—have we got that exactly right?"
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,I don’t know.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"I mean, I—but that’s clearly—that’s the reality."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"In terms of those institutions, they do have supervision by the CFPB and other state regulators."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,But you’re right.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"They’re much—much of the origination process has moved outside the banking system, and it’s something we monitor."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"But they’ve commented on—at a high level rather than trying to get involved in particular, you know, particular measures."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,MARK HAMRICK.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"A simple drop in equity prices is— all by itself, doesn’t really have those features."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"It’s a relatively small number, and those particular countries have, you know, have particular vulnerabilities, which are well known in the form of budget deficits, and significant external dollar borrowings, and high inflation, and things like that."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"So, again, we’ll continue to conduct U.S. monetary policy as transparently as we possibly can, and that’s really the best thing we can do, along with supporting U.S. growth."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"I’ll just—I think that answers both your questions, actually."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,VIRGINIE MONTET.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,Virginie Montet with Agence France-Presse.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"You mentioned earlier a possible, not probable, correction, and I want to come back to the high level of the stock market."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,Are there any participants to the FOMC to think that we are witnessing an episode of irrational exuberance or rational exuberance?
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"And if there was a steep correction, would it provoke financial stability concerns?"
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,So I don’t comment on the appropriateness of the level of stock prices.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"I can say that by some valuation measures, they’re in the upper range of their historical value ranges."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"But, you know, I wouldn’t want to—I wouldn’t want to speculate about what the consequences of a market correction should be."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"You know, we would—we would look very carefully at the nature of it, and I mean, it—really—really what hurts is if consumers are borrowing heavily and doing so against, for example, an asset that can fall in value."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,So that’s a really serious matter when you have a housing bubble and highly levered consumers and housing values fall.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,And we know that that’s a really bad situation.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"It could certainly feature—it could certainly affect consumption and have a negative effect on the economy, though."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,Thanks.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"But in the longer-run, fiscal policy will have a significant effect on the economy, so for that reason, I think my predecessors have commented on fiscal policy."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"We regulate financial institutions, financial stability, that sort of thing."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,Hi.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,Jean Yung with Market News International.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,Can you give us an update on the technical adjustment in implementing monetary policy that the Fed made earlier this year when it decoupled the interest on excess reserves rate from the upper bound of the target range?
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,And have you been happy with that adjustment?
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,And do you see the need to make another such adjustment in the near future?
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,JEAN YUNG.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,So we’ve said that we would use our tools to assure that the federal funds rate trains—trades within the target range.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"So we—in June, when we raised rates, we only raised the interest on excess reserves by 20 basis points and raised the range by 25, and that moved federal funds sort of back into the range."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"It worked, and it was successful."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"The federal funds rate traded in the low 190s, well within the range."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,We may—we may do that again.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"You know, we—again, we have our tools, and we will use them."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"We think it’s principally a function just of a number of things, but particularly high Treasury supply, and—which is showing up in repo rates and then showing up in fed funds as well."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"And the principal tools we use have been interest on excess reserves and then, at the bottom end, a reverse repo facility."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"It’s moved up off its lows, but it’s not as high as it was at the beginning of last year yet by a significant margin."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"Of course, the Treasury is responsible for managing the dollar, but the dollar has only partly recovered the decline that it had in 2017."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"I would say, you know, we’re not responsible for the dollar."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,Sure.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"So, you know, some of the things that we’d be looking at to tell us whether we’re getting close to supply-side limits would be, first, does job growth slow down?"
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"A slowing down in job growth would be an indicator, you know."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,An unexpectedly sharp increase in wages or inflation could tell you that you’re reaching those points.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"You know, if headline growth slowed down, that’s another one."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,So all of those things would be worth taking into consideration.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"I think also, though, we’ve seen sometimes sharp tightening in financial conditions, as we saw at the beginning of 2016, can have a substantial effect pretty quickly on our economy if it’s a broad and significant tightening."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,So we would be looking for those kinds of things and many other things.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"So, in terms of divergence, yes."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"So the U.S. economy is, as I mentioned, is strong and is at a pretty positive moment, you know, with strong growth, healthy labor market, inflation right on target, as I mentioned."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"So—and we’ve seen growth abroad, but growth, I think, both in advanced economies and in some emerging economies has slowed down a little bit."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"And in that world, you know, if the U.S. is stronger, then that’s just part of the context, part of the environment that could mean a higher dollar."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,It could be—it could therefore mean that some of our demand will wind up being shared with other economies.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,That’s the way the integrated international economy works.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"So you could see that, and, you know, it’s just—it’s just all of the—all things that go into thinking about, you know, the path of the economy."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,So we don’t see it as a—as a big problem.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"We see it as a problem we can address with our tools, and we’ll use them if we have to."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,COURTENAY BROWN.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"Hi, Chairman."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"And that—the trend there is running around 2 percent, so if wages are running at rough—wages and benefits running at roughly 3 percent and inflation running at around 2 percent."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,PCE headline inflation is at 2.3 percent.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"PCE core is at about 2, and I think we see that, you know, the temporary increase in headline inflation as being a function of oil prices probably, and we expect inflation to go back down to 2 percent."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,So we think of that as 2 percent.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,That’s how we think about it.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,Is that—I hope that helps.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,MYLES UDLAND.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"Myles Udland, Yahoo Finance."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"Chair Powell, I want to follow up on something you said, actually, at Jackson Hole."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"You were talking about longer-term structural challenges for the economy, and you mentioned that addressing the federal budget deficit, which has long been on an unsustainable path, becomes increasingly important as a larger share of the population retires."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"I’m just wondering if you could, you know, maybe expand on your thoughts there and if this is an issue that comes up among members of the FOMC at all."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,So it doesn’t really come up.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,It’s not really our job.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,And we do—we do monetary policy.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,We just think it’s more accurate.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,We don’t have responsibility for fiscal policy.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"It’s a little broader, and it tends to run a little bit lower as well, but that’s not why we pick it."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,Some people pick CPI.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,Courtenay Brown from Axios.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"Last month, the CEA outlined a different way to calculate wage growth."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"Has the Fed looked at that at all, and what are you seeing in terms of nonwage-based compensation?"
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"So I wouldn’t comment on a CEA paper, and I would imagine they probably wouldn’t comment on our stuff, either, but I would just say this."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,So I am familiar with the question and the work.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"You know, we look—we look at a range of indicators of wages, and I think the broader, the better."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"You really—in a perfect—a perfect wage measure would also include benefits, because a lot of compensation these days shows up in the form of benefits rather than wages, so I think it’s right to choose those broader ones."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,But they’re kind of all telling the same story right now.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"If you look at the principal four that we look at—we look at a whole range of wage and benefit cost indicators—they are all now showing wages and benefits around 3 percent growth, right?"
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,Clustered around 3 percent.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,That’s a full percentage point higher than it was five years ago.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,That’s a good thing.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"Then the question—the other question is, what about inflation?"
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"You know, if you’re—if you’re looking for real wage increases, you’ve got to ask inflation, and there, you have to pick an inflation measure."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"We, of course, pick personal consumption expenditures because we think it’s a little better measure."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,I think the point with “accommodative” was that its useful life was over.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"And, you know, until we see it in the numbers, it’s hard to say how one would react."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,These are individual forecasts.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"You know, it’s far out into the future."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,I think it’s hard to be confident that that’s—that that’s the way things are going to be.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,What we’re going to be doing as we—as we go through time is asking at every meeting whether monetary policy is set to achieve our goals.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"And I think that that’s an assessment of where policy will need to be some years down the road, and I’ll leave it at that."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,HOWARD SCHNEIDER.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,Thanks.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,Some of—some of the participants have mostly very modest overshoots of their personal estimates of neutral a couple—three years out.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,Howard Schneider with Reuters.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"Because you’ve got four years here of unemployment below 4 percent—very low, substantially below NAIRU, what appears to be NAIRU—but no reaction of inflation there."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,And so I don’t think that’s ever happened since the 1960s.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,Why do you think it’s going to happen now?
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"Or in the alternative, is this forecast for unemployment just being driven by your confidence intervals to the extent that, well, we don’t know what else to do, so just extend the lie out—line out until something happens?"
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"No, you’re right."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"Chair Powell, I think—is this too good to be true?"
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,So you’re right.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"In terms of ’20 and ’21, why—your question was why the funds rate needs to be above neutral?"
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"So the answer is, we take everything into account, but, you know, broader financial conditions are just one of the things that we take into account."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"We have disparate points of view, which we debate extensively and come to a perspective and try to set monetary policy to achieve maximum employment in a context of price stability."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,That’s what we do.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,We don’t consider political factors or things like that.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"And so that’s who we are, that’s what we do, and that’s just the way it’s always going to be for us."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,STEVE LIESMAN.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"Steve Liesman, CNBC."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"Can you explain how—the stock market being at a near all-time high, corporate spreads being very tight—how does the level of the market factor into your decisions to raise interest rates?"
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,Is there a concern on your part?
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"And then, as sort of a second and related part, can you tell us what happens in 2020 and 2021 that—I know you can’t tell us when you’re shaking your head [laughter]—that prompts—that prompts you—the Fed to think that the rates need to still be above neutral in that time period?"
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,Thank you.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,Sure.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"So in terms of financial markets and monetary policy, we—as we say in our statement every cycle, we do take financial conditions into consideration because financial—broader financial conditions do affect the broader economy, and they’re one of the many things that we take into account."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"The part of it that we control, though, is what we do with the federal funds rate and that has—that has effects out through, you know, out through the full interest rate curve and into financial asset prices generally."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"The Committee forecasts what they—what they show, in general, is an economy where unemployment remains in the high and middle 3s throughout the entire forecast period and inflation remains very close to 2 percent."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"We consider the best thinking, the best theory, and the best evidence."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,That is what the forecast shows.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,And it’s just—it’s a—it’s a world of strongly anchored inflation expectations.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"We don’t see any signs of that now, but we’re always trying to navigate between those two shoals."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"And we think that gradually, you know, raising interest rates is the way that we kind of take both of those risks seriously."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,SAM FLEMING.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,Thanks very much.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,Sam Fleming from the Financial Times.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,The Fed has recently been saying that financial stability risks are moderate.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,So we’re—that—that’s happened through history.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,What kind of developments could prompt a change in that assessment to elevated risks?
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,Thanks.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,So I think one of the most important lessons from the financial crisis is really the importance of the stability of the financial system.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"And so we—since the financial crisis, as you’re aware, we’ve had a major focus on building up our monitoring of financial conditions and financial stability issues."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"We’ve also put in place many, many initiatives to strengthen the financial system through higher capital and better regulation, more transparency, central clearing, margins on uncleared derivatives, all kinds of things like that, which are meant to strengthen the financial system."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"We’ve done many of those things, and we feel that the financial system is in a much better place."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"And is there an argument for moving the countercyclical capital buffer, even when risks are moderate, rather than waiting until the risks are seen as elevated, which, arguably, could be too late?"
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"Or if we move too slowly, we have an economy that can overheat."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"One is that if we move too quickly, we can, you know, snuff out a recovery unnecessarily, and inflation falls short of its 2 percent target."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"We’re always trying to, you know, work our way between the—sort of the two—the two problems we face."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"And that’s not just our forecast, that’s many forecasts."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,So that is—that is —that is the forecast.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"So you may ask—I mean, the sense is, what does the longer-run natural rate of unemployment mean?"
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,And so that really is a longer-run concept that we think the economy will return to over the longer run.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"But, obviously, that longer run, you know, isn’t— it’s not creating problems in the short run for that forecast."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,Now let’s just admit that the inflation process has changed dramatically from where it was in the 1960s to where it is now.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,It’s in a good place now.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"We can’t take for granted that it will remain the way it is, and, you know, we will be, of course, watching carefully."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"If inflation reacts more strongly or more weakly to the strong economy, then we’ll adjust policy appropriately."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,HOWARD SCHNEIDER.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"If I could follow up on that, what are you buying with interest rates?"
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"Well, interest rates, of course, have effects on growth, have effects—I mean if—I guess the—your question was, what are you buying with by raising interest rates?"
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"The question is, what would the economy look like if you didn’t raise rates?"
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"It would look very different, I think, if we didn’t raise rates."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"And that is based on our understanding of the way the inflation process works now and on the fact that the inflation seems to be fairly nonreactive to changes in slack— that is to say, a flat Phillips curve."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"As we look at—as we look at conditions most recently—and this was at our last meeting, and it was in our minutes for the last meeting—quarterly, we have a briefing at the FOMC, and also at the Board, of the staffs’ views on financial stability, and the staff judged the overall vulnerabilities to be moderate."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"So we’ve been given a really important job to do on behalf of the American people by Congress, and we’ve been given the tools to do it, and my colleagues and I are focused exclusively on carrying out that mission."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,And do you have any concerns about the effect of these types of comments on the perception of the Fed’s independence and your monetary policy?
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"In particular, we’re holding the largest banks to much higher standards in the amount of capital and liquidity they hold and in the ways they assess and manage the risks they take."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,I am confident that the system today is stronger and in a far better position to support the financial needs of households and businesses through good times and bad.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,We continue to work to sustain these fundamental improvements while also ensuring that regulation is both effective and efficient.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"Now, let me go into more detail about the developments that motivated today’s policy decision."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"Both household spending and business investment are expanding briskly, and the overall growth outlook remains favorable."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"And several factors support this assessment: Fiscal policy is boosting the economy, ongoing job gains are raising incomes and confidence, and overall financial conditions remain accommodative."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"In addition to holding interest rates low to support the recovery, we have also taken many steps to make the financial system safer."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,These conditions are consistent with our Summary of Economic Projections for this meeting.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"Job gains averaged 185,000 per month over the last three months, well above the pace needed in the longer run to provide jobs for new entrants to the labor force."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,The unemployment rate stood at 3.9 percent in August and has been near that level since April.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"Smoothing through month-to-month variations, the labor force participation rate remains about where it was in late 2013—a positive sign, given that the aging of our population is putting downward pressure on participation."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,We expect the job market to remain strong.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,And the median of Committee participants’ projections for the unemployment rate later this year is 3.7 percent and a bit lower than that in 2019.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"Overall consumer prices, as measured by the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE inflation), increased 2.3 percent over the 12 months ending in July."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,The median of Committee participants’ projections for the growth of real GDP is 3.1 percent this year and 2.5 percent next year.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"As I mentioned, 10 years have now passed since the depths of the financial crisis—a painful part of our history that cost many Americans their jobs, their homes, and, for some, their hopes and dreams."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"These rates remain low, and my colleagues and I believe that this gradual return to normal is helping to sustain this strong economy for the longer-run benefit of all Americans."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,We took another step on that path today with a quarter-point increase in short-term interest rates.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"Transcript of Chairman Powell’s Press Conference September 26, 2018 CHAIRMAN POWELL: Good afternoon, everyone."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,Thanks for being here.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"I am going to start with an overview of how my colleagues and I see the economy, what we decided today, and then a bit about our expectations for the months ahead."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,Our economy is strong.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,Growth is running at a healthy clip.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"Unemployment is low, the number of people working is rising steadily, and wages are up."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,Inflation is low and stable.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,All of these are very good signs.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"Of course, that’s not to say that everything is perfect."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,The benefits of this strong economy have not reached all Americans.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"Many of our country’s economic challenges are beyond the scope of the Fed, but my colleagues and I are doing all we can to keep the economy strong, healthy, and moving forward."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,That is the best way we can promote an environment in which every American has the opportunity to succeed.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"Each time my colleagues and I meet, we face the same question: How can we set policy to best support job growth and low, steady inflation?"
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"For many years, this question called for very low interest rates to help an economy that had been damaged by the deep financial crisis that gripped the world 10 years ago."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"As the economy has steadily gained strength, the Fed has been gradually returning interest rates closer to levels that are normal in a healthy economy."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"The core price index, which excludes the prices of energy and food and tends to be a better indicator of future inflation, rose 2 percent over the same period."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"The FOMC seeks, and expects to see, inflation remaining near our 2 percent longer-run objective on a sustained basis."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"For example, the recent rise in oil prices has pushed inflation a little above 2 percent, but we expect this to be transitory, as is reflected in our projections."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"Chair Powell, given the lags of monetary policy, I want to know how you think about ending the tightening cycle?"
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,How will you know when to stop?
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,And do you need to keep going until something in the economy breaks?
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"So the tightening cycle, as you know, is a reflection of the strength of the economy."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,And it’s almost three years now that we’ve been gradually raising rates.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"Nick Timiraos, the Wall Street Journal."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"And I think the fact that we have moved quite gradually, in a way, allows us to carefully watch incoming data in the real economy and in the financial markets to see how the economy is processing higher interest rates."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"And so far, the economy has performed very well and very much in keeping with our expectations."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,JIM PUZZANGHERA.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"Hi, Jim Puzzanghera from the L.A. Times."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,President Trump has stated publicly he’s not thrilled with the interest rate hikes.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,His comments didn’t appear to have any impact on you or your colleagues.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,Were his comments discussed at your meeting?
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"And the fact that we’re moving so gradually—I think it—I think it limits the long and variable lags problem because, you know, we’re being able to raise rates and then wait and see how the economy absorbs these rate increases."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,Thank you.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,NICK TIMIRAOS.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,I’m happy to take your questions.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"I think market participants generally find that interesting information, and so it seems to me to be serving a purpose."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"Today the Committee raised the target range for the federal funds rate by ¼ percentage point, bringing it to 2 to 2¼ percent."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,This action reflects the strength we see in the economy and is one more step in the process that we began almost three years ago of gradually returning interest rates to more normal levels.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"Looking ahead, today’s projections show gradual interest rate increases continuing roughly as foreseen in June."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,The median of participants’ views on appropriate policy through 2020 are unchanged since the June meeting.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,These projections play an important role in our work.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,My colleagues and I believe that it’s useful to communicate our views on likely prospects for the economy and for policy.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"We are well aware, however, that the economy regularly surprises, and that even the most carefully constructed projections are highly uncertain."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"The projections about the appropriate path of policy assume that the economy evolves broadly in line with the projections for growth, employment, unemployment, and inflation."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"If the economy were instead to falter, lower interest rates would be appropriate."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"Conversely, if inflationary pressures were to rise more than expected, higher interest rates would be appropriate."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"Right now, as our statement indicates, risks to the economic outlook appear roughly balanced."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"Readers of the FOMC statement likely noted that the Committee dropped a sentence that indicated that “the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative.” This change does not signal any change in the likely path of policy; instead, it is a sign that policy is proceeding in line with our expectations."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"We still expect, as our statement says, “further gradual increases in the target range for the federal funds rate,” and this expectation is reflected in the projections that I just discussed."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,Thanks very much.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"At any given time, inflation may be somewhat above or below 2 percent."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"If you dig into the different aspects of that question, households or balance sheets are in good shape."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,The median projections for both the overall and core inflation measures remain very close to 2 percent across the whole projection horizon.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"The banking system, as I mentioned, is—you know, much higher capital, much higher liquidity—is much stronger."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,Yeah.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"You know, so we’ve been—I think the perform—labor force participation has surprised us on the upside."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"There is a long-run trend there, and we’ve now had basically five flat years."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"If you look—if you look at labor force participation, since the fourth quarter of ’13 till now, you really have a—kind of an oscillation that basically is a sideways movement in the face of a significant downward trend, thanks to aging and other factors."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"That’s a gain of well more than a percentage point in participation, so that’s really— that’s really a good thing."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"Those are people who are remaining in contact with the labor force and looking for jobs, finding jobs."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,Yeah.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,So that’s a great thing.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,It’s one of the things that has allowed the unemployment rate not to fall further.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"And it’s a—it’s a signal, too, that there may be more there on the supply side, that there may be more labor supply than the prior trend would indicate."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,So it’s a very positive thing to see people staying in the labor force.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"And, you know, we don’t know how long it can continue."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"We have models, and we look at this—we look at this question all the time."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"And, you know, admittedly, we’ve been surprised on the positive side here, so we’re open to the idea that that may continue or not."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"And, by the way, it’s a signal."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"You mean—you mean, where’s the point at which inflation— unemployment is too low?"
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"The amount of job vacancies that we have out there and the number of people coming back into the workforce this year—where is the point at which, then, we are actually above the natural rate of unemployment and the Federal Reserve should reexamine the consistency of the rate hikes going forward so not to cool an expanding economy?"
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,We really don’t see that.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"It’s not in our forecast, but any—so I would—I regard that as a risk."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,I think either a significant— significant—correction and lasting correction in financial markets or a slowing down in the economy that’s inconsistent with our forecast—those are the kinds of things we’d react to.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"In terms of what, you know, what we would do—you know, I think we’re always going to be adjusting monetary policy to—in light of conditions on the ground."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"So if the economy is weakening, then it’s very possible we’d be—we’d be cutting rates and, you know, vice versa."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,And so I can’t rule that out.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"It—I think it’s quite difficult, though, to know what the effects— what the sort of end effects of fiscal policy are going to be in 2020."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"It’s difficult to know what the policy will be, let alone what their effects will be that far out."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"So we have to make estimates, but we know that they’re highly uncertain."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,EDWARD LAWRENCE.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,Edward Lawrence from Fox Business.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"Thank you, Chairman."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,The unemployment rate is now at 3.9 percent.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,The average hourly wages rose 2.9 percent for the past 12 months.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"Inflation, according to your numbers, holding steady."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,DONNA BORAK.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,We don’t see that.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"Hi, Chair."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"Just to follow up on the tariff question, you said earlier that it seems as the effects of the tariff so far haven’t quite materialized—those weren’t your words verbat[im]—but Wal-Mart, Gap, Coca-Cola, General Motors, Macy’s have all said that they expect the tariffs to affect the prices of everyday consumer goods."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,MICHAEL MCKEE.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"Mr. Chairman, Michael McKee, Bloomberg Radio and Television."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,Financial conditions are still extremely loose by all the measures that track that.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,The flow of funds shows the decline in short-term borrowing other than in Treasuries.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,So I’m wondering if that suggests a change in the way that tightening affects the economy.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"And along those lines, you mentioned that you dropped the word “accommodative” doesn’t suggest a change in policy."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"And, you know, we just aren’t, and we’re watching very carefully."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"But if you’re dropping forward guidance in terms of “accommodative,” does the dot plot really serve any purpose anymore if, as you say, you can’t be confident out to 2021 what’s going to happen with the economy?"
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,A couple questions in there.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"So the dot plot—I mean, I—it’s not new."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,I don’t think it’s a new point that forecasts two and three out—two or three years out are fairly uncertain.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,The dot plot is individual FOMC participants who are writing down their individual views on the evolution of the economy and of appropriate monetary policy.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,We don’t vote on that.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"You know, employment is high, wages are rising, that sort of thing."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"We’re seeing a sort of modest increase in wages, inflation right around 2 percent, no sense of it moving up really, so we’re not seeing it yet."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"We’re hearing a lot, you know, what amount to supply-side constraints and things like that, but we’re not seeing it."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"You’re hearing—we’re hearing a lot of talk of labor shortages, of material costs in particular industries."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"So my question is, when—should there be an effect—when would you expect to see that?"
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,And at what point do you start to become worried that it’s actually going to affect consumer spending and dampening economic growth?
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,It’s a concern.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,It’s a risk.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"You know, so you could see prices moving up."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"You don’t see it yet, but we—you could see retail prices moving up."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"The tariffs might provide a basis for companies to raise prices in a world where they’ve been very reluctant to and unable to raise prices, where raising prices is really difficult, you know, with the ability to shop on the internet."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"This could provide, you know, a way for—again, we don’t see it in the numbers."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"And the other question would be, if you’re just talking about the effect on inflation is, is it just a one-time increase in the price level, or is it actually fueling higher inflation going forward?"
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"And that’s a real—that’s an important question in, in how we would think about the appropriate response."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,DONNA BORAK.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"But is there a sense of timing, in terms of when you might see that kick in, the effect of?"
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"You know, don’t see it yet, but we—you’re hearing—I mean, broadly across the economy, it’s not just tariffs."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,Donna Borak with CNN.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"You know, the main thing where we might need to move along a little bit quicker would be if inflation—inflation surprises to the upside."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,Don’t see it yet.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,What do you—what kind of outlook do you have right now for the trade war?
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,Sure.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"So I guess I need to start by saying that we’re not responsible for trade policy, and we don’t comment on particular, you know, trade actions and that sort of thing."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"But you will have seen that we have this very extensive network of business contacts around the country through the Reserve Banks largely, and we’ve been hearing a rising chorus of concerns from businesses all over the country about disruption of supply chains, materials costs and increases, and loss of markets, and things like that."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"So we’ve been hearing quite a lot of that, and we—the Reserve Bank presidents talk about it in the meeting, and it goes in the minutes."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,You did not mention them.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"So we, you know, that’s—we’re very transparent about hearing all that."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"And—or you can look at it the other way: You can ask, if all of the tariffs that have been announced are applied, what would be the effect at the aggregate level?"
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,And they’re still relatively small.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"You know, we worry about a couple of things."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"One is loss of business confidence, which could reduce investment."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"Again, we don’t really see effects that we could measure yet."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"Also, the possibility of a financial market reaction over time to unexpected trade developments."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"I think if you look at the aggregate perform—the performance of the U.S. economy at an aggregate—at a national level, it’s hard to see much happening at this point."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"Could you talk about the discussion you’ve had—your policy statement, does it mention the trade tensions?"
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"The researchers at the European Central Bank this week put out a paper saying that the impact of a trade war on the U.S. could be dire, that the U.S. economy could drop by 2 percent in the first year after a widespread trade war."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"Marty Crutsinger, Associated Press."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"If you look at asset prices, it is true that some asset prices are in the upper range of their historical—upper reach of their historical ranges."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"Okay, so I think I mentioned in the opening remarks maybe something that addressed your question about what would make us go faster and slower."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"And then if you look at nonfinancial corporates, you get—there is the story of leverage there."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"So it’s not that there aren’t any vulnerabilities, but we see them as moderate."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"Now, you ask about the countercyclical capital buffer."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"The countercyclical capital buffer is a tool that we added to our toolkit, I think, finally, back in 2016."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,We said that we would deploy it when vulnerabilities were meaningfully above normal.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"We revisit that on a regular schedule, and the last time we revisited it was, I think, last year—sometime last year—and concluded that the test was not met."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"As I mentioned at the last briefing, the—you know, the assessment was that vulnerabilities were moderate, but it remains a kit—a tool for our toolkit that we can deploy, you know, when and as we feel appropriate."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,SAM FLEMING.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,Has the chance of needing to deploy it increased?
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"As I said, I think I’m in the camp of seeing vulnerabilities as relatively moderate."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,I think the financial system—I think another thing that we learned in the crisis is that we need to be alert to the buildup of vulnerabilities as a long expansion continues.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"I don’t see that in troubling—troubling amounts at this point, but, you know, I think it’s appropriate for us to monitor that very carefully."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,MARTY CRUTSINGER.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"More than anything, though, I would worry, in the longer run, where this is going, you know."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"If the— if the end place we get to is lower tariffs, that would be good, you know."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"And, you know, fair trade—fair trade under internationally accepted rules can be a good thing."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"Oh, supply-side effects, yeah."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"So, you know, we hope they’re huge, frankly."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"You know, the idea is, you cut—you reduce taxation on corporations and particularly—and allow faster expensing for investment."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"The idea is to encourage more investment, and that is one of the things that drives productivity, which is one of the main things that drives rising incomes."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"So the effects are very uncertain, they’re—you know, they’re—the literature is—it’s—there’s no clear answer to exactly how these mechanisms work or how effective they are."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,And it would be soon to be seeing supply-side effects.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,The other—supply- side effects are probably both more uncertain and they’re probably slower to come in.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"But, you know, as I said, we—I certainly hope—I hope that we’ll be marking up our estimates of potential growth as well."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,Craig Torres from Bloomberg News.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"Taking a page from your risk- management approach in Jackson Hole, Mr. Chairman, I’m wondering if you can talk about what risks would make the Committee—plausible risks—go faster in 2019."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,What risks would make them go slower?
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,If you could talk about scenarios.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"Trade generally supports productivity, supports higher incomes."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"I know the forecast doesn’t show that, but I’m curious how you soft-land without doing that."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"And then I’d like to ask, do you see yourself, as this stimulus tails off, which it does in the forecast, possibly cutting rates to soft-land the economy?"
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,And the supply-side effects?
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,CRAIG TORRES.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"If you look back over the last decade, this is a pretty good moment for the U.S. economy."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,HEATHER LONG.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,HEATHER LONG.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"I think if this, perhaps inadvertently, goes to a place where we have widespread tariffs that remain in place for a long time—a more protectionist world—that’s going to be bad for the United States’ economy and for American workers, and families, and also for other economies."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,This is the third time this year that the FOMC has raised its growth forecasts.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,I’m wondering if you could share a little bit about what’s causing that rise and whether you see supply-side effects coming through from the fiscal policy—fiscal stimulus yet.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"Hi, Heather Long from the Washington Post."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,So it’s true.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,Thanks.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"This—as the year’s gone on, the economy has come in stronger than we expected, and that’s a really good thing."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"But, you know, the growth picture is very much supported by very high readings of household confidence, business confidence, so it’s a—it’s a—it’s a—it’s a pretty particularly bright moment, I think."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,This year has—we’ve kept raising our forecast for this year.
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"You know, some of it is, no doubt, the effect of the fiscal policy changes, the tax cuts, and the spending increases—that’s got to be part of the story."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"Part of it may be higher oil prices, which are calling for more investment in the oil patch."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,"And the economy, as I mentioned at the beginning, is strong, and there’s good reason to expect that to continue."
2018-09-26,Press Conf - Q&A,You ask why.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"But, remember, from a macroeconomic standpoint, no one market is the single dominant indicator and it really matters if changes are sustained over time."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,That’s how we think about it.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"And, you know, that—we tried to factor that into our models of the economy and to the results that come out of those models."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,There’s been a tightening since right around after—a week or so after the September meeting.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"So we do, you know—we follow markets really carefully."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"And, you know, what we’ve seen here is a tightening."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,So we look for that.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,A little bit of volatility—speaking in the abstract—some volatility doesn’t probably leave a mark on the economy.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,And what matters for the broader economy is material changes in a broad range of financial conditions that are sustained for a period of time.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,GREG ROBB.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"You know, financial conditions—broadly speaking, we don’t look at any one market."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"So when you see the markets, you know, what are the markets telling you?"
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,Just following up on Paul’s question— President Trump said recently that you should feel the markets.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,Greg Robb from MarketWatch.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,That’s how I think about it.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"We’ve taken that on board both in the outcomes, in our forecast, but also in a lower rate path to—you know, to provide some accommodation to push back against that tightening."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"For now, financial conditions have tightened a little bit."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,We’ll just have to see.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,Nancy Marshall-Genzer with Marketplace.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"That doesn’t mean that it’ll come into the real data in a big way—it may, but—or that financial conditions will tighten further."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,But that mood is out there.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,We look at a really big range of financial conditions.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,Do you still think core PCE is a good measure of whether the economy is overheating?
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"So, presumably, there will be some adjustment in how the market anticipates when a rate hike is coming."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,So I think we’ll move to a more—we’ll have the ability to move eight—at eight different meetings.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,What might it be—to different people?
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"I think it’ll also become the case, over time, that there will be no “prior” as to whether we would move at a quarterly meeting or one of the meetings at which we do not file an SEP. As you know, we only update our projections under the current approach quarterly, whereas we have eight—eight meetings."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,I do believe it will be a positive development.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,So that’s the plan.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"And so, being able to come out after each meeting and explain the Committee’s thinking and relate that to the state of the economy and expectations for policy and global developments, I think it’ll be—the idea is that it’ll be helpful in explaining how we’re thinking and, you know, explaining what we’re thinking about policy going forward."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,That’s the plan.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,I certainly hope it will.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,I think having regular press conferences will be a big gain for communication.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"How has the Committee thought through communicating those potential policy moves, especially in light of the fact of the tremendous amount of uncertainty going into next year?"
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,What do you think of other measures like setting a target for economic growth and relying more on that?
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"Next year, every meeting will be a live meeting."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,DONNA BORAK.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"But I think that approach has served us well, and I think we can work well with it."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"When they work temporarily in different ways, we take a balanced approach."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"Most of the time, those two things work together."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"But in terms of just targeting growth, you know, I think—I actually think our dual mandate works very well, which is maximum employment and stable prices."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"Now, it did move up last year."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"It’s really true, though, that inflation has not reacted a lot on a road from 10 percent unemployment to now 3.7 percent unemployment."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"And that is often attributed to the success of central banks in anchoring inflation expectations so that people believe that inflation will come back to the target or around the target so it doesn’t go down as much—inflation doesn’t go down as much in a downturn and doesn’t go up as much when the—you know, when the economy is strong."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"There was a time when inflation reacted really quickly to changes in growth and changes in unemployment, and that time is behind us."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"It has—what’s happened over, really, 50 years is that inflation has become much less reactive to changes in growth."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"Well, I think we look at both, but core PCE is a good indicator."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"Chairman Powell, Donna Borak with CNN."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,Why not?
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"But does it need to be restrictive, as the dots seem to suggest that it will be?"
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"So—and, you know, what—what you’re picking up now, I think, is, there’s, you know, a mood of concern, or it’s a mood of angst about growth going forward, if I could just capture it in one thought."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,And I don’t believe that it is.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,No.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,Does it currently need to be restrictive?
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"You said that policy does not need, at this point, to be accommodative."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,Ann Saphir with Reuters.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,ANN SAPHIR.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"So, for me, that—but I would want to leave open—my mind open on that and have that discussion with my Board colleagues when the issue arises."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"I will tell you, I recently gave a speech saying that I believe that financial stability vulnerabilities were roughly at a moderate level."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"I think we’ll be doing it early next year, and we’ll be reaching that judgment then."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,We haven’t done it since early this year.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,We meet and discuss that and evaluate it on roughly an annual basis.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,And so that’s a tool I’d be absolutely willing to use and happy to use at such time as that test is met.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"In terms of the CCyB, so the CCyB is—the countercyclical capital buffer is a tool that allows us to build capital at a time when vulnerabilities—financial stability vulnerabilities—are meaningfully above normal."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"And we’re going to take all that information, and we’re going to make the best decisions we can, and nothing will cause us to deviate from that."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"We get survey data from thousands of people, and so we really do have a pretty broad exposure to what’s going on in all different parts of the country."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"We—every business—every FOMC cycle, we talk to hundreds of people in all different parts of society, not just business people or market people, but people from community development organizations."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"And that involves, you know, I think getting the best thinking together, diverse perspectives."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"I’m not worried, because—about—on the first question— because I know, and everyone who works at the Fed knows, that we’re going to do our jobs the way we’ve always done them."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,Is that something that you think the Fed should look at doing?
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,Do you disagree with her analysis?
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"Not eight times, but at eight different meetings on the year."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,I don’t believe that policy is restrictive.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,ANN SAPHIR.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,Next year.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,The dots suggest it will be restrictive next year.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,So that kind of anecdotal data really helps me capture the picture better.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"My background is very much working—starting with, you know, a small group of people, maybe a company, and working out."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,interesting.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"So, if you look at the Tealbook, or—you know, we get the Tealbook in person from the Reserve Bank presidents who come in, and they share their discussions not just with their directors, but with literally hundreds of business and nonprofit, you know, and labor union people around the country.1 And I personally find it really 1 Chairman Powell was referring to the Beige Book, not the Tealbook."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,Thanks.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"You know, are markets on to something that, again, hasn’t showed up yet in the data?"
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,And I was just wondering if you’re hearing anything from businesses that might explain the recent market moves.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"In Dallas last month you talked about the usefulness of speaking with businesses, sometimes hearing things that aren’t yet showing up in the economic data."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,Thanks for the question.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"Hi, Paul Kiernan from Dow Jones Newswires."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"There are many reasons that are given for that, but, generally speaking, it’s—it’s a concern about, is growth going to be as strong as it was?"
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,PAUL KIERNAN.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"So I don’t—I wouldn’t put too much on—it does inform you, the way people are thinking about things."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"There would be circumstances in which it would be appropriate to go past neutral, and there would be circumstances in which it would be wholly inappropriate to do so."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"Ultimately, it’s going to depend on what the circumstances are."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,So people have disparate views on what the endpoint could be.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"We vote on the rate increase, and we write down our—you know, our own personal paths."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,They’re out in the future.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,And I guess I would just go back to this: The individual forecasts are not something that the Committee votes on.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,It’s a very good question.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"Yeah, I—I’ve discussed this a couple of times."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,Should it be?
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,But don’t—I wouldn’t take it as a signal about current policy or about near-term policy.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,DONNA BORAK.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,You said in October in an interview with PBS that interest rates were a long way from neutral.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"And, you know, there are implications of that."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,We’ve arrived effectively at the bottom end of that range.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"It’s—where we are right now is, we’re at the lower end of the range of neutral."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"You know, monetary policy is a forward-looking exercise, and I’m going to—I’m just going to stick with that."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,Were they right to interpret it that way?
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,And I think a lot of people interpreted that as a shift in tone from you.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,A month later you said interest rates were just below neutral.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,I’m wondering if you could clear up what’s become a little bit of a debate in the financial community.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"Hi, Chairman, Courtenay Brown from Axios."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,COURTENAY BROWN.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"As I mentioned, our forecast for next year is—I think, in keeping with most other forecasts—is that we’ll still have solid growth next year, declining unemployment, and a healthy economy."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"But, you know, we don’t know that that’ll happen."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"You know, I think if rates were to stay low for a longer period of time, that could be thought of as a signal of expectations of lower growth."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"Really, the longer Treasury has moved in a range above 3 percent and down 3 percent as the risk sentiment has changed."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"And, you know, we don’t know whether that’ll persist."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"That’s consistent with, you know, a risk-off feeling in the stock market as well."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"You know, if you ask what’s going on with the long—certainly the long, longer-maturity Treasury market has come in some."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"You know, we look at a whole range of them, and we ask ourselves, what’s really going on in the broad picture out there?"
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"Again, we do focus on a broad range of financial indicators, and I—really, we don’t obsess about any particular one."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"On the other hand, could it be a positive, in terms of presumably bringing down mortgage rates and helping the housing sector?"
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"Is it a worrisome sign for you in terms of the outlook for growth, for inflation?"
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"For that, as I mentioned, going forward, there’s real uncertainty about the path—the pace, rather, and the destination for further rate increases."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,And we’re going to be letting incoming data inform our thinking about the appropriate path.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,MICHELLE FLEURY.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"Michelle Fleury, BBC News."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"And then, also, I was wondering if you could comment on—Governor Brainard gave a speech recently where she laid out the case for the countercyclical capital buffer being activated."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,Thanks very much.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,So we’ll be watching it carefully.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"Honestly, it shouldn’t have major implications for the United States, but, you know, there’s a lot of uncertainty because it’s not something that’s happened before."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,So it’s something we’re watching carefully.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"That was a big issue that seems to have been satisfactorily, for the time being, resolved."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,I was very happy to see the developments around central counterparties today.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"Our financial institutions have had a long time now to get ready for the full range of possible exits from the EU by the U.K. And they’ve had supervisory involvement from U.S. supervisors, from U.K. supervisors, from EU supervisors—we think they are fully prepared for the full range of outcomes that may come out of that."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,And I’m going to—I’ll mention Brexit.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"And, you know, as far as those are concerned, we monitor them very carefully."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"We also monitor, you know, event risks like Brexit—like, you know, like the negotiations between Italy and the EU over their budget."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,I wonder what you make of it.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"So that is one—that’s, I think, the key fact."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"So you have still healthy levels of growth in the aggregate around the world but close to the potential growth rate of, you know, the global economy."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,What has happened instead has been a modest retracing of that.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"And people raised their forecasts for growth around the world kind of throughout 2017 and, in some sense, expected that to continue into 2018."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,It was the year of synchronized global growth.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"So, if you go back a year, 2017 was a year of kind of ongoing upside surprises in global growth."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"More broadly, I’m referring to global growth."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,What else?
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"But could you elaborate on what economic developments you’re referring to, whether Brexit is one of those?"
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"I was wondering, you touched on trade, the trade dispute with China."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"Chairman Powell, you talked about monitoring global developments."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,But you no longer have the really strong levels of growth you had in 2017.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"The 10-year note yield has gone down pretty steeply, roughly 50 basis points, I think, in recent weeks."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"I know you look at many different financial indicators, but let me focus your attention briefly on bond yields."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"Steve Beckner, freelance financial journalist reporting for NPR, Chairman Powell."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,Labor slack?
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,DON LEE.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,So did that answer your question?
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,We don’t think of it that way.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"So I would expect that wages will keep moving up, and it doesn’t necessarily mean inflation."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"We hear a great deal of anecdotal information about labor shortages, along with other, you know, bottlenecks and things."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,So it would be welcome.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"There’s plenty of evidence of situations—for example, in the very tight labor market of the late 1990s of a—I think I mentioned in a speech a month or so ago, we had wage increases above productivity plus inflation, and we didn’t have high inflation."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,Wage—wage increases do not need to be inflationary.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"I do expect, and I think many forecasters expect, that wage increases will continue, and that would be a welcome development."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,Labor slack.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"So in an economic sense, it makes sense."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,And they were all kind of clustered around 2—if you go back five years ago—2 percent increase per year.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,But there are four principal ones.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"If you go back a few years, you’ll see that we look at many, many indicators of wages and compensation."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"So what we’ve seen is, is a very gradual—and, I think, ongoing—increase in wages."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"You mentioned broad-based wage gains this year, and I’m wondering if you see further acceleration in wage growth and just how much slack there is in the labor market."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,Don Lee with the L.A. Times.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,DON LEE.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"If we, you know—if we’re—if we want to communicate something about something that’s going to happen in a future meeting, I think we know how to do that in speeches, in press conferences, and such."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"I mean, I think that’s probably pretty straightforward."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,Yes.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"Now they are all at 3, and they’ve just continued to gradually move up—not perfectly in sync, but—and that’s a number that is, you know, right in keeping with 2 percent inflation and 1 percent productivity growth."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"I guess that’s sort of the question that I’m trying to drive at is, in terms of communicating to the market, because we’ve been—the market’s been so adjusted to the fact that these are quarter-end rate hikes, and now you have the potential to move eight times a year—is the Fed thinking through how it’s going to communicate when it plans, especially given the amount of uncertainty?"
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,Yes.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"And, by most indicators, we are at or even above longer-run normal levels."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,STEVEN BECKNER.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"And while we may tailor some regulations, those fundamentally high expectations are not going to change."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"And, again, I wouldn’t want to materially change capital levels, because, I think, you know, it’s important that the largest financial institutions, the largest and most complex—the systemically important ones be held to the highest standards and higher expectations."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"You know, we—we think that things need to be looked at carefully."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,That’s something we’re working on.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,I know that the larger institutions tend to be the ones who care about the Volcker rule.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"I think, with the larger institutions, we want regulation and supervision to be effective and efficient."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"So, in the nature of that, you’re focused more on the smaller institutions."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,And the sense of “tailoring” is that we want to look below the level of the G-SIBs at the large regionals and then on down to the community banks at various steps and ask whether we have appropriately tailored regulation and supervision to account for the fact that smaller and less complex organizations present a much less significant threat to the economy and to the community should they fail—should they experience material difficulty.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,So you’re right that a big focus of what we have been doing has been tailoring regulations.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"So, you know, by most indicators—we look at a very wide range of indicators on the labor market."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"And I’m thinking specifically of the G-SIB capital surcharge, which several members of Congress have sent letters to you asking you to revisit and reconsider."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"That is, a sort of tailoring enhanced prudential standards, particularly for those banks, and I’m thinking of the stress capital buffer as well as the most recent proposal on banks between $100 and $250 billion."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"So, many of the Fed’s regulatory proposals so far, especially this year, have been primarily focused on banks in the sort of medium-to-small range."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"A regulatory question, if I may."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"Hi, John Heltman with American Banker."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,JOHN HELTMAN.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,And that’s nothing but a good thing.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"I think, given the strong economy, we’ve had the luxury of finding out that labor force participation can be higher than we had thought."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"And—or, or are the problems more structural than cyclical, and that there isn’t—so we’ll have to find that out."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"You know, there’s a question, can we go above that cyclical peak?"
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,Most other age groups in both genders have moved back up pretty close to where they were at the last cyclical peak.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"But I would point to one particular pocket, and that is, labor force participation by younger prime-age workers, particularly prime-age males, is still, you know, meaningfully below its pre-crisis level."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"G-SIBs and the largest banks seem to be sort of left out in a lot of these proposals, and I’m wondering if that is meant to send a message that the Fed does not really intend to change its regulatory structure for the largest banks going forward, or if you’ll get to that maybe later."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"I wanted to ask, first of all, whether you’re worried that President Trump’s tweeting and statements might interfere with your ability to communicate with markets and why you’re doing what you’re doing."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"We know the President said, you know, don’t raise interest rates."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,VICTORIA GUIDA.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"As I mentioned, there’s significant uncertainty about the—both the path and the ultimate destination of any further rate increases."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,So I do think that gives the Committee the ability to be patient in moving forward.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"And during that period we’ve had low unemployment and strong growth, and inflation has still remained just a touch below 2 percent."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"More broadly, 2018 has been the strongest year since the recov—since the financial crisis."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"Inflation has come in just a touch below where we expected it to be—not by a big amount, but by a small amount."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"Well, you’re right, Sam."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,Thanks.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"And in the context of a more data-dependent Fed, how will the Fed respond to further undershoots of inflation moving into next year?"
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"I wonder, first of all, if you could explain why you think, despite the extremely tight labor market, we’re still not seeing much in the way of inflationary pressures."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,One of the recent surprises has been fairly tepid inflation data.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,Sam Fleming from the Financial Times.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,Thanks very much.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,SAM FLEMING.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"Thank you, and I’ll be happy to take your questions."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"We know that our policy decisions affect all American families and businesses, and we’ll continue to make our decisions objectively and based solely on the best information and analysis."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"We will adjust monetary policy as best we can to keep the expansion on track, the labor market strong, and inflation near 2 percent."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,Neither the pace nor the ultimate destination of any further rate increases is predetermined.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"Actual policy will, as always, be adjusted as incoming data shed light on the state of the economy, the outlook, and the changing balance of risks."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"We believe that the SEP provides useful information about Committee participants’ thinking, but the median is not a consensus judgment and certainly does not represent a Committee plan."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,Each participant’s projection represents appropriate policy under the baseline outlook—baseline outlook provided by that participant.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,We sometimes point to the median of these projections to illustrate the broad middle of views of the Committee.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,It is worth noting that the Summary of Economic Projections is a compilation of the individual projections of all FOMC participants.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,HEATHER LONG.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"Hi, Heather Long from the Washington Post."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"Today, the Fed lowered its expectations for interest rate increases."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"Given that, I’m wondering if the Fed has had any discussion of altering the course of balance sheet normalization and if you could give us any insight on what might lead the FOMC to alter that balance sheet normalization in 2019."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,So there’s a fairly high degree of uncertainty about both the path and the ultimate destination of any further increases.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"I think, from this point forward, we’re going to be letting the data speak to us and form the outlook and inform our understanding of what would be appropriate policy."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"More broadly, though, I think we’ve reached the bottom end of the range of Committee estimates of what might be neutral."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,That will be the main thing.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"Going forward, you know, I will be looking, in particular, to see whether incoming data tell us that we’re, in fact, on that path, that development of the economy is in line with that expectation."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,So I’d say that’s a reasonably positive forecast.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,We’re forecasting that growth will be strong enough that unemployment will drop still further and inflation will remain right near our target.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"We still are forecasting, individually, growth a bit above its longer-run potential—2.3 percent is what we’re forecasting."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"So, as background, I would just point to 2018 being a very strong year and the Committee looking forward to 2019 and still having what amounts to a positive forecast."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,Or does the current environment of restrained inflation maybe allow you to space out your next few moves and take more time to get there?
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"Moving forward, my colleagues and I will be watching the economy closely for indications that the stance of policy is appropriate to sustain the expansion with a strong labor market and inflation near 2 percent."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"And so as you think about your next policy moves, are you inclined to go at the current recent pace to a slightly different destination that’s laid out in the projections today?"
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,Thanks.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,NICK TIMIRAOS.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"And I do think that we will continue to use monetary policy, which is to say rate policy, as the active tool of monetary policy."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,And I don’t see us changing that.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,I think that the runoff of the balance sheet has been smooth and has served its purpose.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,And I think that has been a good decision.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"So we thought carefully about this, on how to normalize policy, and came to the view that we would effectively have the balance sheet runoff on automatic pilot and use monetary policy, rate policy, to adjust to incoming data."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"If you go back some years, I think we—people who were working at the Fed in 2013 and ’14 took away the lesson that the markets could be very sensitive to news about the size of the balance sheet, the pace of asset purchases, the pace of runoff, and things like that."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,Sure.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"Chairman Powell, you talked a little bit earlier about the ability to be patient."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,STEVE LIESMAN.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"When rates are in this range, the FOMC makes policy in light of the array of diverse views on the Committee."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"After today’s action, the target range for the federal funds rate is 2¼ to 2½ percent, putting it at the lower end of the range of estimates of the longer-run normal rate provided by the Committee."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,Three years ago the Committee came to the view that the best way to achieve our mandate was to gradually move interest rates back to levels that are more normal in a healthy economy.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"And the economy did recover steadily, if slowly at times."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"As the economy struggled to recover from the financial crisis and the subsequent recession, the Committee held our policy rate near zero for seven years to give the economy the best chance to recover."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"The projections also show a modestly lower path for the federal funds rate, which should support the economy and keep us near our goals."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"The projections of Committee participants released today show growth continuing at healthy levels, the unemployment rate falling a bit further next year, and inflation remaining near 2 percent."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"Most FOMC participants have, instead, modestly lowered their growth and inflation forecasts for next year."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"In our view, these developments have not fundamentally altered the outlook."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"At the same time, financial market volatility has increased over the past couple of months, and overall financial conditions have tightened—that is, they have become less supportive of growth."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"Growth in other economies around the world has moderated somewhat over the course of 2018, albeit to still-solid levels."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"Despite this robust economic backdrop and our expectation for healthy growth, we have seen developments that may signal some softening relative to what we were expecting a few months ago."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"Although some American families and communities continue to struggle and some longer-term economic problems remain, the strong economy is benefiting many Americans."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,Inflation has remained low and stable and is ending the year a bit more subdued than most had expected.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,Wages have moved up for workers across a wide range of occupations—a welcome development.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,The economy has been adding jobs at a pace that will continue bringing the unemployment rate down over time.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"Since September, the U.S. economy has continued to perform well, roughly in line with our expectations."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,I’ll explain how my colleagues and I are incorporating those crosscurrents into our judgments about the outlook and the appropriate course of policy.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"Since the September meeting of the FOMC, however, some crosscurrents have emerged."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,All of those things remain true today.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"Over the past year the economy has been growing at a strong pace, the unemployment rate has been near record lows, and inflation has been low and stable."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,[Cough] Pardon me.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,Thanks very much for being here today.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"Good afternoon, everyone."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"Transcript of Chairman Powell’s Press Conference December 19, 2018 CHAIRMAN POWELL."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,Today we raised our target range for the short-term interest rates by another ¼ percentage point.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"As I’ve mentioned, most of my colleagues expect the economy to continue to perform well in the coming year."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,Many FOMC participants had expected that economic conditions would likely call for about three more rate increases in 2019.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,We have brought that down a bit and now think it is more likely that the economy will grow in a way that will call for two interest rate increases over the course of next year.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"And, given our four rate increases and the ongoing reduction in our portfolio, monetary policy will be providing a smaller boost to the economy in 2019."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,Inflation in the median projection remains near 2 percent.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"With growth remaining next year above its longer-run normal value, the unemployment rate is projected to fall a bit further, to 3.5 percent by the end of 2019."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,The median of FOMC participants’ projections shows growth of 3 percent this year and 2.3 percent in 2019.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,The additional tightening of financial conditions we have seen over the past couple of months along with signs of somewhat weaker growth abroad have also led us to mark down growth and inflation projections a bit.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"FOMC participants, along with many other forecasters, had long predicted some moderation of growth in 2019."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"In early 2018, we saw a rising trajectory for growth; today, instead, we see growth moderating ahead."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"With that caveat, there are two important differences in the policy outlook today versus next year."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,History attests that unforeseen events as the year unfolds may buffet the economy and call for more than a slight change from the policy projections released today.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,We know that the economy may not be as kind to our forecasts next year as it was this year.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,What kind of year will 2019 be?
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"Over the next year, if events play out broadly as expected, the federal funds rate will be in a range in which judgments of people both inside and outside the Fed will sometimes differ regarding whether the stance of policy is modestly accommodative, neutral, or modestly restrictive."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"And when the economy has performed about as expected, the Committee has generally moved in line with the median projection as we did in 2017."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"In 2018, the economy was somewhat more robust than expected, and this led to a slightly faster pace of policy normalization than had been projected."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,This illustrates the nature of data dependence that we always emphasize.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"The signs of a more robust economy proved accurate, and the FOMC has now raised rates four times this year, counting today’s action, one more time than anticipated in the median projection a year ago."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"Early in 2018, it became clear that the economy was likely to be even stronger than we had expected, in part because the fiscal stimulus adopted near the start of the year was larger and more front-end loaded than most had anticipated."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"Thus, in December 2017, the median of the projections of FOMC participants pointed to three ¼ point interest rate increases in 2018, which would have left the target range for the federal funds rate at year-end at 2 to 2¼ percent, still below most estimates of the longer-run normal rate."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"Given this outlook, Committee members judged that the appropriate way to sustain the expansion with inflation near 2 percent was to continue gradually withdrawing the extraordinary support for the economy that had been in place for almost 10 years."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"This growth was predicted to push the unemployment rate down to near historic lows, and the increasingly tight labor market was expected to help push inflation up to 2 percent."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,FOMC participants and many other forecasters were predicting that growth in 2018 would be strong.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"Last December, the unemployment rate was 4.1 percent, and inflation had been running just below 2 percent."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"And, given recent developments, the statement notes that we “will continue to monitor global economic and financial developments and assess their implications for the economic outlook.” Now I will provide some additional context and detail, starting with a review of policy over the last year."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,We always emphasize that our policy decisions are not on a preset course and will change if the incoming data materially change the outlook.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"When the economy has, instead, turned out weaker than expected, the Committee has slowed or paused the pace of rate increases as we did in 2016."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"Mr. Chairman, Steve Liesman, CNBC."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"Second, the economy has continued to strengthen this year."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,The first is how the market’s decline affected the outlook for the economy and for rates.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"We know in the markets that the cost of credit rising, commercial paper, repo rates, the TED spread widening—do you see any concerns about the availability or the price of credit that could slow the markets?"
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,The balance sheet reduction—how much additional tightening do you think has come from that?
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,Michael McKee from Bloomberg Radio and Television.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,MICHAEL MCKEE.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"It’s something that each of us writes down, and we always update it as—you know, as data come in and as we update our outlooks."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,It’s not something that we vote on.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"But that doesn’t mean we don’t like to repeat what it isn’t, which—it’s not a consensus forecast."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"But, in general, I think people sort of have it figured out and understand what it is and what it isn’t."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"I think the dot plot generally does provide useful information about the reaction function of Committee participants—sometimes more useful than others, I’ll admit."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"As I mentioned, on the dot plot—you asked about the dot plot."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,So that’s the sense of that.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"We are looking for better ways to achieve the inflation goal—for example, on a symmetric basis."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"We’re not looking at law changes at all, and we’re not looking at changing the inflation target, for example."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"And we’d want to be evaluating ideas for—again, for better achieving the goals that Congress has given us."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"We may be in a world where interest rates are just lower for the time being, and, therefore, we’ll have less policy space to react to economic downturns."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,One of the overarching facts is that rates have been really coming down overall for more than three decades now.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"And, again, the idea is to, you know, listen to new ideas, better ideas, old ideas—many of them have been around—and try to assess whether there are better ways we can do things."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"And what we’re going to do is, we’re going to open ourselves up and have a discussion with many outside groups of all different parts of the economy, including, you know, an academic conference in June in Chicago."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"So this review, what it really is—it’s coming at a time when the economy is strong, and it’s a good time to take a step back, we think, and ask whether our strategy and our tools and our communications around monetary policy are doing the job that Congress has assigned us to do on behalf of the American people."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"Are we dealing with it the way that you want us to be handling the dot plot, or is it something that you might tweak a bit?"
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,How do you think the dot plot is working?
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"Could you talk a little bit about what you expect to get from that panel, and will the dot plot be involved in that at all?"
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"And if, in 2019, we see the economy start to slow, would you, if you don’t adjust the balance sheet, be risking too much tightening?"
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"And if you just run the quantitative easing models in reverse, you would get a pretty small adjustment in economic growth and real outcomes."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"So we don’t think, you know, things that are happening at the short run—at the short end—are driven by many other factors other than the balance sheet runoff."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,Could you tell us how three things affected the outlook for the economy and rates?
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"So that’s what we mean when we say we’re “data dependent.” Of course, we’re always data dependent, but I think it has a particular meaning in this context, which is that."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"As I mentioned, once you—once you’re, broadly speaking, in the range of neutral, I think it’s appropriate to be putting aside individual estimates of that and be looking at what the incoming data are telling you about the outlook, updating your estimates of what neutral might be, of what the natural rate of unemployment might be, of the state of the economy, so—and letting that lead you to adjust your outlook and, therefore, your appropriate path for policy."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"So, to make further moves, I’ll be looking for data that suggests that that’s, in fact, the path that we’re on."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,So that’s a pretty positive forecast.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,It involves growth at a strong enough level to continue driving unemployment down and inflation near 2 percent.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"That forecast involves growth, you know, between 2 and 2½ percent."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"You know, we’re watching—we have a strong forecast, generally, for next year."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"And then, in addition, what data are you specifically looking at for you that shows when the Federal Reserve starts to become that headwind in the economy with the rates?"
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"Do we need to keep this, as you say, gradual?"
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,You’ve established for this coming year a communications panel to look at how the Fed communicates.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,When do you think these pauses need to come in next year?
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,It’s well documented.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"Hi, Mr. Chairman."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,We’ve seen enormous volatility in the markets recently.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"Hi, Edward Lawrence, Fox Business Network."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,EDWARD LAWRENCE.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"But we don’t see, you know, the balance sheet runoff as creating significant problems."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,We’re watching them carefully.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"So, you know, we’re alert to these issues."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,Tightening of the federal funds rate has raised short-term borrowing costs.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"For example, just—very large bill supply has pushed up short-term rates, has pushed up repo rates."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,The National Association of Realtors’ chief economist says that it’s starting to affect first-time homebuyers with the mortgage rates going up.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"Mr. Chairman, Marty Crutsinger with the AP."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"So we do watch all of that, but the amount of—the amount of runoff that we’ve had so far is pretty small."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"I also think we took on board, you know, the risks to that, and, you know, we’re certainly cognizant of them."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,Your new forecasts say that you’re going to undershoot it for the eighth straight year.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,You’re about to undershoot your inflation target for the seventh straight year.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"Binya Appelbaum, the New York Times."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,BINYAMIN APPELBAUM.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"And you know, we are—we at the Fed are absolutely committed to that mission, and nothing will deter us from doing what we think is the right thing to do."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"We have the independence, which we think is essential to be able to do our jobs in a nonpolitical way."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,We have the tools to carry it about.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,We’re always going to be focused on the mission that Congress has given us.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"On your third factor, you know, political considerations have played no role whatsoever in our discussions or decisions about monetary policy."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,The large effects would have to come from financial market changes or from losses in business confidence.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"If you just mechanically drop into a model of the U.S. economy tariffs, you don’t see very large effects."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,Should we interpret the dot plot as suggesting that some members of your Committee believe that policy should be in a restrictive range by the end of next year?
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"I think, more broadly, there’s been a sense of concern among business people and market people about global growth, and, you know, that may be partly about trade tensions, it may be partly about a variety of things."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"So we definitely did take that into account, and, as you can see from the statement language, we acknowledged those risks in the clause about monitoring developments."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,So we also took down our rate forecast.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"But, remember, that’s in a context of a more accommodative path."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,That’s why the forecast for growth and inflation went down a little bit.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,So we took that on board in our forecast.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"And we took on board the tightening in financial conditions, which—not any one condition, but, broadly speaking, financial conditions have tightened since the September meeting, really."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"So, as I mentioned, we monitor a broad range of economic conditions, including financial conditions—a broad range of financial conditions."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,And the third is comments by the President urging you not to hike rates.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,MARTIN CRUTSINGER.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"The second is trade tensions and the tariff, or how you factor that into your outlook."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,And we’re going to be watching carefully to see as those things develop.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"If so, can you help us to understand why people would be advocating restrictive monetary policy at a time of persistent inflation undershoots?"
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,And those are things that are very difficult to model.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,So that’s the basis upon which we made the decision.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,We’re now at the bottom end of the range of estimates of neutral.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,It seems appropriate that it be neutral.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,It can move to neutral.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,Policy at this point does not need to be accommodative.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"And we also have a positive forecast, as I mentioned, and, in that context, we think this move was appropriate for what is a very healthy economy."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,You’ve got inflation moving up to 2 percent.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,You’ve had growth well above trend.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"If you look at 2018, as I mentioned, this the best year since the financial crisis."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"So, again, I go back to the health of the economy."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"Just following up on Binya’s question—I guess if you haven’t achieved 2 percent inflation and you don’t see an overshoot, which would be sort of implied by a symmetrical target, what’s the point in raising rates again at all?"
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,You’ve got unemployment dropping.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,JEANNA SMIALEK.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,So that remains to be accomplished.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"The only way to achieve inflation symmetrically around 2 percent is to have inflation symmetrically around 2 percent, and we’ve been close to that but we haven’t gotten there yet, and we have not declared victory on that."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"And I don’t—you know, I’ve never said that I feel like we’ve achieved that goal yet."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,We’re trying to be symmetrically around 2 percent.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,We’re not trying to be under 2 percent.
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"Inflation is symmetric around 2 percent, and that’s how we’re going to look at it."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"I think we’re very close to 2 percent, and, you know, we do believe it’s a symmetric goal for us."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"And you’re right, inflation has continued to surprise to the downside—not by a lot, though."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"Hi, Jeanna Smialek, Bloomberg News."
2018-12-19,Press Conf - Q&A,"Well, we—as a Committee, we do not desire inflation undershoots."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"You know, I would point to all the continuity here."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"Of course, you know, November, December, and January were much slower months for those sorts of things."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"But, you know, it’ll be something that we’re always paying close attention to."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,GREG ROBB.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"Chairman Powell, Greg Robb from MarketWatch."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"The Dow Jones industrial average is up more than, like, 500 points."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"There’s a sense in the market that there’s, you know, what people call the “Powell put” on the markets."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,Are financial markets wrong in that assessment?
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,It’s something that we’re watching.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,Financial markets have reacted strongly to the decision and the press conference.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,So it’s a concern.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,So we monitor those risks very carefully.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,Do they have obligations to underwrite loans which build up in a pipeline?
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,Do they retain big pieces of the loans?
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"The question is, what is their exposure?"
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"In other words, banks are arranging a lot of these loans."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,We also watch carefully for the exposure of the financial system to these companies.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,So we watch that.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"So they can amplify, in effect, a negative downturn."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"So, we did—we’ve called out corporate debt as a risk—more of a macroeconomic risk, I think, than a financial stability risk, the sense of that being that if you have companies that are highly levered and we do go into a downturn, they’re going to be less able to weather that and keep serving their customers and, you know, may have to do layoffs and things like that."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,I want to talk to you about corporate debt.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,Are you worried that by taking a pause in raising interest rates—we’ve had low interest rates for so long—are you contributing to a bubble in corporate debt?
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"You know, the thing we did on the balance sheet is something we’ve been working on for, frankly, years— the thing we announced today."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"And, frankly, the banks monitor them much better with our support and help than they did before the crisis."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,And so we’re providing clarity there.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"So, ultimately, I think we benefit from having strong growth abroad, although you point to an interesting case."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,My—honestly—only motivation is to do the right thing for the economy and for the American people—that’s it.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"Chairman Powell, Mark Hamrick with Bankrate."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,I’m Nancy Marshall-Genzer from Marketplace.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,MARK HAMRICK.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"I mean, part of the story of 2017, for example, was that European growth kept coming in stronger and stronger, and that meant the euro was strong, and that supported our exports."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,We trade with these countries.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,We export to these countries.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"Ultimately, though, you know, a strong global economy is good for us."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"You know, Steve, it’s certainly possible."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"Mr. Chairman, you’ve echoed the widespread concern about slowing growth in China and elsewhere in the world, but I wonder whether it’s possible that slower growth abroad might actually be beneficial to this country, in some respects, at least—for example, perhaps increasing capital inflows and putting downward pressure on long-term rates in this country, as happened in the Asian financial crisis in the late ’90s."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"Steve Beckner, freelance journalist reporting for NPR."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,Thank you.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,I think that’s a constructive thing to do.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,STEVE BECKNER.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"Those are great questions, and those are questions that are, you know, that our great supervisory people are looking at."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,I’m not going to be able to help you much on that.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"I’m curious if you think a fintech charter is a good idea in general, and what conditions you think might be necessary to allow the Fed to allow such a chartered institution access to the payment system."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,And one of the questions around that charter has been whether the Federal Reserve will allow such a chartered bank to access the payment system.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"Chairman Powell, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency last year completed its fintech charter."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,JOHN HELTMAN.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,I feel strongly that it is.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,And I think it’s the right thing.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"We see these uncertainties, and we see a time when we can afford to—we have the luxury of being able to wait and watch, and that’s what we’re planning to do."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,And it’s just the stance of policy we think is appropriate.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"And this situation, I think, calls for patience—I think it does."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"I think we’re open to these ideas, but I don’t have any news for you on that today."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"So with a larger balance sheet—with a larger balance sheet, could you—how could you handle that next recession, then, with the combination of those two?"
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"So the concern is more a longer—for me—a longer, drawn-out set of negotiations back and forth, which could result in sapping business confidence."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,Right.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"I’m just wondering about, for American families that missed two paychecks, how is this going to play out for them for the months to come?"
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"Just talking to other folks outside, businesses— clearly they were suffering and seeing a lot of pain."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"I’m wondering, as you guys discussed during this week’s meeting, what the potential economic impact would be of the shutdown, the possibility of a second one, whether or not it would diminish consumer confidence, have some severe ripple effects?"
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,You mentioned a couple of weeks ago that that information would clearly show up in the data.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"I just wanted to go back to—you had mentioned on the crosscurrents, the government shutdown issue."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"Chairman Powell, Donna Borak with CNN."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,DONNA BORAK.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,There would be room to do substantially more.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,Yes.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"So let me give you the economic side of it first—is that, even with a fairly long shutdown, as long as that’s the end of it and everyone gets their backpay—except the contractors, I guess, the private-sector contractors, but—some people get their backpay, then the lost GDP will be regained in the second quarter."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,Above $4 trillion?
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,EDWARD LAWRENCE.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"But we would use it after using our conventional tools, which would be the interest rate and forward guidance about the interest rate."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"But as we said in today’s release, if that happens, then we’ll use the full range of our tools, and that includes the balance sheet."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"Now, there’s no reason to think that it would be."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,We don’t think anything like that is in the cards.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"I guess the sense of your question is that we could be in a situation in the future—we hope not, but—we could be in a situation where we’d like to cut rates more than we can effectively, and we hit the zero lower bound."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"You say that’s your first tool, that’s your primary means of adjusting monetary policy."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,I’ve talked the last year with a number of Fed presidents who worry that under 3 percent is not enough to handle the next recession.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,The long-term federal funds rate is 2.8 percent.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,Thank you.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,Even if you have a large balance sheet—$4 trillion?
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,Uncertainty is not the friend of business.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,So that’s that.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"I see, you know, federal employees doing their work, and I’m, you know, really grateful they did."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"So far, the actual amount of tariffs that have been applied both here and in China is not enough to have material effects on GDP either here or in China."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"If they linger, then there could be more and more uncertainty, and you worry over time that that could have an effect on business confidence."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"I would say the longer-term concern, though, is the negotiations that are going on."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,So that’s been a concern.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"And there have been real concerns about trade right along the line, both in terms of availability of materials and costs and retaliation and that kind of thing."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"It’s incredibly valuable, because you’re getting actual reports from people who are on the line."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,The Beige Book is a collection of all of our—of the comments that our Reserve Bank presidents get from their Districts.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"So, trade—you sound like you’re an avid reader of the Beige Book, and that’s great—the trade, as you will know, then—trade has been a big feature in the Beige Book for some time now."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,Did that play a part in the discussion and the decision that you made on shifting the wording in your statement?
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,The Beige Book that was prepared for this meeting noted a rising concern among business contacts about higher trade tariffs and the tensions there.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"Marty Crutsinger, AP."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"I would say that the—you know, we all see the suffering and the heartbreak and all the pain people go through."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,MARTIN CRUTSINGER.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,And I think that was something that we and many others were worried about as there was talk of an even longer shutdown.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,That would be the channel.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"If there were going to be a permanent effect or a lasting effect, let’s say, it would be from a longer shutdown or perhaps a second shutdown, and that would be through the channel of a loss of confidence in our ability to make policy in the United States."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"As I mentioned, there wouldn’t be if there isn’t another shutdown."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,So would there be a permanent effect?
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,And I’m just wondering if you’re thinking about the path of future policy and the possibility of reaching this point again on February 15?
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,So you don’t see a permanent effect of this shutdown?
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"Yes, it does."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,DONNA BORAK.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,Did that answer both your questions?
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"I mean, to be doing your work while you’re not getting paid, it’s something we should all be grateful for."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"In terms of ideas for not having more shutdowns, I know Congress is actually looking at some of those, so I think that could be a profitable thing to explore."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"As you probably heard, the Congressional Budget Office is projecting that federal debt is expected to surge to about $29 trillion over the next 10 years, reaching the highest share since the end of World War II."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"And so I would just ask, are you surprised by how far that conversation has gotten just in the last six weeks?"
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"And then, secondly, what effect does that have on interest rates and the public if indeed that’s even close to being true?"
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,So it’s not a bad thing that banks hold onto these reserves or another safe asset.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"We didn’t create the reserves, you know, with that in mind, but, you know, since—in the post-crisis, you know, regulatory regime, we have brand-new and quite substantial liquidity requirements, which are very good and which have great public benefit."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,And we want the banks to be safe and sound.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"They are, in fact, a very safe asset—in a way, the safest asset."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"If banks want to use reserves for a good and sufficient reason—which is to say, to hold liquidity as we require them to do to meet the liquidity coverage ratio, to meet their resolution requirements and resolution planning—we’re not going to discourage them from holding them."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"So if you think that the level of demand for reserves is here [gesturing with hands together, in the middle], all you can say is, it’s probably somewhere in this range [gesturing with hands apart, equidistant from the middle]."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,These estimates are fairly uncertain.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,I want to be clear about that.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"We don’t take—you know, we don’t think we have a precise understanding of this at all."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"But do you take the survey results as given, or do you try to encourage banks from holding a [inaudible]?"
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,JEAN YUNG.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,We don’t—we’re not encouraging them to hold reserves instead of Treasuries.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"The only way you can figure it out is by surveying people and market intelligence and then, ultimately, by approaching that point quite carefully."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"And, again, there’s no cookbook here, there’s no playbook."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,So that implies you’d want to be a bit above what that equilibrium demand for reserves is.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"We’d rather just, you know—in managing the federal funds rate, we’d rather have it set by our administered rates."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"We don’t want the Fed to have a, you know, a large ongoing presence in the market around this."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"If you operate too close to that point of scarcity, then you wind up having to have these big, ongoing interventions in the market."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"And then we would want to be—we would want to have a buffer, as I mentioned in my remarks, because we want to be operating in an abundant reserves regime where we operate through our administered rates."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,And then there would be a buffer on top of that.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"And so our understanding, really, of the distribution of reserves and how much will be needed has moved up over the past year."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"So the question is, how much of that amount is actually going to be needed in the end after, you know, after the firms adjust to our very gradual decrease?"
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,Reserves are still quite abundant.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,I think our understanding of demand for reserves—remember that the banks have more reserves than they need.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,I don’t know that demand for reserves has risen over the past years.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,No one really knows.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,Let me be clear.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,Treasuries or reserves are roughly equivalent for this purpose.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"Hi, Mr. Chairman."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,Thanks very much.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,That’s what’s happened.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"I think that there’s—I think the market is now looking for more clarity around that, and I think we’ll be providing it."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"So that went along that way very well, and I think that division of labor was a good one for our policy and for the benefit of the country."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"And we put that out there very publicly and in the hope that it would be priced in and understood, and that then we could put the balance sheet on the side and have interest rates be the active tool of policy."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"So what we did was we set up the normalization of the balance sheet in a way that was very transparent so that you could look and know really, certainly as to Treasuries, pretty much the exact amounts and the timing in which we would be returning these assets to private hands."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"We learned during the taper tantrum, frankly, in 2013 that was—that would be confusing to markets."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"You know, I’ll quickly go back—in 2017, we were—in designing the normalization plan, we were concerned at not having two active tools of policy."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,EDWARD LAWRENCE.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"Because putting out a statement, clarifying your view on the balance sheet, you know, is somewhat surprising, considering it is restating, you know, what the Fed had said all along was the goal with balance sheet normalization—to roll it off, not have it be a key part of policy."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"And are you surprised at how much of a conversation we’re having around the balance sheet, and how much talk about the balance sheet from yourself and various Fed officials have moved financial markets?"
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,COURTENAY BROWN.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"I would just ask, I guess, about the balance sheet in general."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,MYLES UDLAND.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"But, again, the entire focus we have is on maximum employment and stable prices, not on any particular financial market or financial conditions generally."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"That’ll have an effect on—over time, an effect on the economy."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"So if you lower interest rates and they stay low, every borrower in the country ultimately has a lower interest rate."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,It does.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"So financial conditions matter, and they matter in the way that I suggested earlier—which is to say, broad financial conditions changing over a sustained period—that has implications for the macroeconomy."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"We— as I mentioned earlier, we—our tool, you know, our interest rate tool operates on the economy through financial conditions."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"I would say that, you know, our mandate is maximum employment and stable prices, and that’s about, you know, hard, real-side economic data."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,How do you balance those two things?
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,A data- dependency question: Has there been a prioritization of market data over the economic data?
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,Courtenay Brown from Axios.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"Chairman Powell, Myles Udland with Yahoo Finance."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"First of all, does that sound like it could be a reasonable forecast, with the Administration seeming to take plenty of opportunities to question the legitimacy of CBO?"
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,How will the Fed judge what is a reasonable level for financial institutions’ demand for reserves when it appears to be rising at a fast pace over the past year and perhaps at a faster pace than can be explained by regulatory changes during that same time frame?
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,Thanks.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"Are we looking at staying accommodative for some time, or has your estimate of neutral come down, in light of the recent volatility in markets?"
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"So I think a key question right now is, is policy accommodative at this moment?"
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,Right now we’re between 2.25 and 2½.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,They’re all above 2½ percent.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,I know where the FOMC participants’ estimates for the long-run interest rate are.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,Paul Kiernan from Dow Jones Newswires.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"Hi, Chairman."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,PAUL KIERNAN.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"So it’s a serious problem, but it’s not a problem that is something that either helps or prevents the Fed from doing our job today."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"It’s more in the longer run, we’ll be spending all of our money on paying interest and not on the things that we really need to be doing for future generations and for our own generation."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"And so I don’t see this, in particular, as a threat to this business cycle or to the economy this year."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"So, you know, first of all, our—the work that we do relates more to the medium term rather than the long term."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"What does that look like, if that really takes place 10 years down the road?"
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,MARK HAMRICK.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"I haven’t actually looked at that report, but my general experience with them is that it’s a professional outfit."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,I have no reason to doubt CBO’s numbers on this.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,We don’t forecast those things.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,We don’t have a forecast.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"Ultimately, we will have to."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"And there’s no time like now—when the economy is healthy, growing, people are working—to go after that problem."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"And that is driven principally by the combination of health-care costs—really, due to our health-care delivery system—and the aging of the population."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"We don’t advise the government or Congress on fiscal policy, so I’ll limit myself to more high-level comments and say that it is not a secret—it is a long-known fact that the U.S. federal government budget is on an unsustainable path, and that needs to be addressed."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"So, first, it is important—we don’t do fiscal policy."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"Would you prefer to err on the side of being more generous, or would you try to encourage banks from holding—to hold less reserves?"
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"So the range of estimates on the Committee starts at 2½ percent, and that’s kind of roughly where we currently are."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,We only know it by its works.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,I have a question about the ultimate size of the balance sheet.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"Hi, I’m Jean Yung with Market News."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,JEAN YUNG.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"But it would be something—probably not material to our economy, but it’s something we’ll be watching very carefully and certainly hoping that there is a resolution short of a hard Brexit."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"I would expect that we would feel some of this, and it’s very hard to have great confidence that you know what that would be."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"So, if you saw financial turmoil and that kind of thing, that would be the way it would reach us."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"The question for us—it wouldn’t be a huge first-order thing, the economic effects, unless you saw financial disruptions."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"If there is a hard Brexit, then that would very likely involve disruptions both to the continental economy and certainly to the U.K. economy, and we would feel that."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,But that’s the financial system aspect of it.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"So we’ve done a lot of work on that, and, generally speaking—again, a lot of work has been done—we have to be humble and say that this is an unprecedented event."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,So we have worked with those institutions alongside U.K. and EU regulators to assure ourselves that those firms have plans and have liquidity and have all of the things they will need to deal with the full range of Brexit outcomes.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"And for us, that starts with U.S. financial institutions that have a presence either in the U.K. or in the EU or both."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"And as I’ve said a couple of times, when you get to that range—you know that we can’t directly observe the neutral rate."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,So we’ve been monitoring the Brexit situation very carefully for a long time.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"Among the global developments that the Fed is monitoring, how much of a risk for the American expansion would be the prospect of a “hard” Brexit?"
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,Virginie Montet with Agence France-Presse.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,Thank you.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,VIRGINIE MONTET.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"We’re going to be watching data to see whether that’s right, and we’re also going to be watching data to see how these crosscurrents resolve themselves and how the U.S. economy performs this year."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,That’s my feeling.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"We don’t—I don’t—again, I think that our policy stance today is appropriate for the state of the economy."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,And I think we’re watching to see.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"There are a number of Committee members who are, you know, right around that range."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,We’re in the range.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,So we can do that.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,And so we have to put aside our own priors of what that rate might be and let the data speak to us.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"And I would want the public to know that, and I would want them to see that in our actions."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,Edward Lawrence from Fox Business News.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,We make mistakes.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"We had an extensive discussion of the baseline and also of the risks to the baseline, and the risks are, of course, the fact that financial conditions have tightened, that global growth has slowed, as well as some, let’s say, government-related risks like Brexit and trade discussions, and also the effects and ultimate disposition of the shutdown."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"Can you clarify— does the FOMC see risks as skewed to the downside, particularly after you removed the statement about risks being balanced?"
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"Last week, the IMF said risks are clearly skewed to the downside for the U.S. and global economy."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,Heather Long from the Washington Post.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,HEATHER LONG.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"So we’ll be—again, we think our policy stance is appropriate."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,We also know that our policy rate is now in the range of the Committee’s estimates of neutral.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,We do.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,We think our policy stance is appropriate right now.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,We think that our policy is at the appropriate point right now.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"So we looked at—we look at those, and the way we think of it is that policy—we will use our policy, and we have, to offset risks to the baseline."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"Basically, are we at neutral now, or does the economy still need accommodation?"
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,Is that still the case?
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,You’ve said recently that policy—the state of the policy was still accommodative and that the economy didn’t require that anymore.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,So you’ve said many times recently that policy was still accommodative and that it needn’t be so.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,Howard Schneider with Reuters.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,HOWARD SCHNEIDER.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,I’ll be glad to take your questions.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,Thank you.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,We believe that this transparency is how we can best contribute to macroeconomic stability.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"We are committed to clearly explaining what we are doing and why we’re doing it, both regarding the path of rates and also regarding management of the balance sheet."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,Times of economic uncertainty put a premium on the clarity and predictability of FOMC policy.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"In those cases, the FOMC would be prepared to use its full range of tools, including balance sheet policy."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"While the federal funds rate would remain our active tool of policy in a wide range of scenarios, we recognize that the economy could again present conditions in which federal funds rate policy is not sufficient."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"If so, how do you justify the removal of the need for some further interest rate increases?"
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"Third, we repeat a sentence of the normalization principles we adopted in June of 2017."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"So we view the baseline as still solid, and part of that is the way we adjusted our baseline to address those risks."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,SAM FLEMING.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,I’m just going to say that the—it’s going to depend entirely on the data.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,Yes.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"First question is, “adjustments”—is that meant to imply the next move is as most likely to be up as down?"
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,RICHARD MILLER.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,Sorry—say again what the first question was?
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"And when you twin “in light of global economic and financial developments” with “muted inflation pressures,” does that suggest you have to see both the cessation of these crosscurrents that you’ve talked about and inflation moving up before you get off the dime, so to speak, and move?"
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,“Adjustments”—does that suggest the next move in interest rates is as likely to be up as down?
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"In light of that, I’m wondering if you can provide us with a “decoder ring” for this statement."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,We learned from the last minutes of the meeting that some of the tweaks you make to the statement have a lot more portent than we thought.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,RICHARD MILLER.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,So that’s the way we’re thinking about that now.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"So I can’t get into specific hypotheticals, but I do believe that we have a symmetric objective, and I believe we’ll act that way."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,It will include all data relevant to our dual mandate of stable prices and maximum employment.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"I would say that we’ll be looking at a full range of data, and that will include inflation data."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,We think there’s no pressing need to change our policy stance and no need to rush to judgment there.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,We think our stance is appropriate.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"You know, generally speaking, we think the outlook is favorable, and we think that these crosscurrents that I referred to—these risks—are going to be with us for a while."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,Thanks.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,How sensitive are you right now to developments in core inflation when determining the next move?
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"Would you be comfortable with continuing patience even if there are modest, if transient, overshoots to the inflation target by core inflation?"
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,The Fed has linked its commitment to patience in part to subdued inflation outcomes.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,Sam Fleming from the Financial Times.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,Thanks.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"Remember that our inflation objective is a symmetric one, meaning that we are— we’re always trying to get to 2 percent, and we don’t look at—we look at inflation equally on both sides."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,We’re not making a judgment.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"This does not mean that we would use the balance sheet as an active tool, but occasional changes could be warranted."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"The statement makes three points: First, as we’ve long emphasized, the federal funds rate is our active monetary policy tool."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"Like many forecasters, we still see “sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near ."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"In particular, our statement today says, “In light of global economic and financial developments and muted inflation pressures, the Committee will be patient as it determines what future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate may be appropriate.” This change was not driven by a major shift in the baseline outlook for the economy."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"Today the FOMC decided that the cumulative effects of those developments over the last several months warrant a patient, wait-and-see approach regarding future policy changes."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,We therefore said that we would be paying close attention to global economic and financial developments and assessing their implications for the economic outlook.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,We also stressed that the extent and timing of any rate increases were uncertain and would depend on incoming data and the evolving outlook.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"At our December meeting, we noted the solid outlook for steady growth, vigorous job creation, and price stability."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"With that in mind, I’d like to spell out how the Federal Open Market Committee has been thinking about these issues."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"At such times, common-sense risk management suggests patiently awaiting greater clarity—an approach that has served policymakers well in the past."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,We are now facing a somewhat contradictory picture of generally strong U.S. macroeconomic performance alongside growing evidence of crosscurrents.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"In other words, as economic conditions and the outlook evolve, we take that new information into account in setting our policies."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,We always emphasize that our policies are data dependent.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"And, while most of the incoming domestic economic data have been solid, some surveys of business and consumer sentiment have moved lower, giving reason for caution."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,Financial conditions tightened considerably late in 2018 and remain less supportive of growth than they were earlier in 2018.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"Growth has slowed in some major foreign economies, particularly in China and Europe."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"Despite this positive outlook, over the past few months we have seen some crosscurrents and conflicting signals about the outlook."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,We believe that our current policy stance is appropriate at this time.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"We continue to expect that the American economy will grow at a solid pace in 2019, although likely slower than the very strong pace of 2018."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,But we’re not going to make mistakes of character or integrity.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"The jobs picture continues to be strong, with the unemployment rate near historic lows and with stronger wage gains."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"The U.S. economy is in a good place, and we will continue to use our monetary policy tools to help keep it there."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"My colleagues and I have one overarching goal: to sustain the economic expansion, with a strong job market and stable prices, for the benefit of the American people."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,I will cover the decisions we made today as well as our ongoing discussions of matters on which we expect to make decisions in coming meetings.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"I will start with a recap of our discussions, including our assessment of the outlook for the economy and the judgments we made about our interest rate policy and our balance sheet."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"Transcript of Chairman Powell’s Press Conference January 30, 2019 CHAIRMAN POWELL."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"There is elevated uncertainty around several unresolved government policy issues, including Brexit, ongoing trade negotiations, and the effects from the partial government shutdown in the United States."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"Second, as far as the particular details of normalization are concerned, we will not hesitate to make changes in light of economic and financial developments."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,But the crosscurrents I mentioned suggest the risk of a less favorable outlook.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,The implementation and normalization statement released today is intended to provide some additional clarity regarding the conditions under which we might adjust our plans.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"Throughout this process we’ve attempted to lay out our plans well in advance, and we’ve been willing to make changes as we learn more about the process."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,The process of balance sheet normalization is unprecedented.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,We will be finalizing these plans at coming meetings.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,This decision will likely be part of a plan for gradually reaching our ultimate balance sheet goals while minimizing risks to achieving our dual-mandate objectives and avoiding unnecessary market disruption.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"In light of these estimates and the substantial progress we have made in reducing reserves, the Committee is now evaluating the appropriate timing for the end of balance sheet runoff."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"The implication is that the normalization of the size of the portfolio will be completed sooner, and with a larger balance sheet, than in previous estimates."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"Moreover, based on surveys and market intelligence, current estimates of reserve demand are considerably higher than estimates of a year or so ago."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,Higher reserve holdings are an important part of the stronger liquidity position that financial institutions must now hold.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"Estimates of the level of reserve demand are quite uncertain, but we know that this demand in the post-crisis environment is far larger than before."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"The decision to retain our current operating procedure means that, after allowing for currency in circulation, the ultimate size of our balance sheet will be driven principally by financial institutions’ demand for reserves, plus a buffer so that fluctuations in reserve demand do not require us to make frequent sizable market interventions."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,Settling this central question clears the way for the FOMC to address a number of further questions regarding the remaining stages of balance sheet normalization.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,2 percent” as the likeliest case.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"As the minutes of our recent discussions have indicated, the FOMC strongly believes that this approach provides good control of short-term money market rates in a variety of market conditions and effective transmission of those rates to broader financial conditions."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"That is, we will continue to use our administered rates to control the policy rate with an ample supply of reserves so that active management of reserves is not required."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,The Committee made the fundamental decision today to continue indefinitely using our current operating procedure for implementing monetary policy.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"Today we made some important progress in clarifying the path forward, as summarized in the Statement Regarding Monetary Policy Implementation and Balance Sheet Normalization that we released with today’s FOMC statement."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"Over its past three meetings, the FOMC has held in-depth discussions on the final stages of this process."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,Let me now turn to balance sheet normalization.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"In this environment, we believe we can best support the economy by being patient in evaluating the outlook before making any future adjustment to policy."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"Similarly, the balance—the risk of financial imbalances appears to have receded, as a number of indicators that showed elevated levels of financial risk appetite last fall have moved closer to historical norms."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"Further, as we noted in our postmeeting statement, while survey-based measures of inflation expectations have been stable, financial market measures of inflation compensation have moved lower."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"Inflation readings have been muted, and the recent drop in oil prices is likely to push headline inflation lower still in coming months."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"Over the past few months, that risk appears to have diminished."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"The traditional case for rate increases is to protect the economy from risks that arise when rates are too low for too long, particularly the risk of too-high inflation."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"In addition, the case for raising rates has weakened somewhat."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"This is often called a “floor system” or an “abundant reserves system.” Under the current set of operating procedures, as outlined in the implementation note released today, this means that the federal funds rate, our active policy tool, is held within its target range by appropriately setting the Federal Reserve’s administered rates of interest on reserves, as well as the offer rate on the overnight reverse repo facility, without managing the supply of reserves actively."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,We don’t have a strong prior.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,Inflation remains near our 2 percent goal.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"Some of the crosscurrents that I refer to may be with us for a while, and I think we’ll be looking at seeing those clear up as it relates to—as they relate to the outlook for the U.S. and that will be an important aspect as well."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"And what matters for financial conditions is, when there are changes and those changes are sustained for a period of time, then they become important for us because they have important macroeconomic implications."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"You know, it’s interest rates, it’s risk spreads, it’s currency, it’s the stock market, it’s credit availability, it’s many, many factors."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"And I would say this: We think about a broad range of financial conditions, not just one or two things."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"So really, your second question is about how do we think about financial conditions."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"So that’s going to be—so it’s hard to say, you know, it’s hard to think of what to call it at this point or how to label it."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"So, patience—I think we’re going to know in hindsight, because the length of this patient period is going to depend entirely on incoming data and its implications for the outlook."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"And I’m wondering about your reaction to the criticism you got on your December 19th news conference, your later statements—do you feel you’ve put a “Powell put” into the markets?"
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,Does “patient” have some sort of time frame?
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"And, if not, can you put a time frame on “patient”?"
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"Is it fair to characterize this as not a pause in a tightening cycle, but the end of the tightening cycle now—a new regime for the Fed?"
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"You said you like to be a plain speaker, so let me try to have you put this as plainly as possible."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,Michael McKee from Bloomberg Television and Radio.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,MICHAEL MCKEE.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,So that’s where we are.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"And they now have persisted and remain tighter— significantly tighter, let’s say—than they were, and that’s something that we have to take into account as well."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,Financial conditions began to tighten in the fourth quarter.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"So those things—in addition, you know, you have to look back."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"If that’s all there is, and the shutdown is gone and there isn’t another shutdown, then we’ll get most of that back in the second period—second quarter."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,We don’t know the ultimate resolution of it.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"And, in addition—I mean, I think important—possibly less important now—probably less important now, but—has been the shutdown, which will leave some sort of imprint on first- quarter GDP."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"We’ve seen that both in China and in Western Europe, and so that’s an important—that has important implications for us, and that story has—let’s just say it continues."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,The incoming data have shown more of that.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"First, the narrative of slowing global growth continues, if you will."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,I’d point to a couple of things.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,So that’s how we think about it.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"So we don’t react to, you know, to most things that happen in the financial markets."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"But when we see a sustained change in financial conditions, then that’s something that has to play into our thinking."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"In fact, our policy works through changing financial conditions, so it’s sort of the essence of what we do."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,We will be— we will patiently wait and let the data clarify.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"You know, we’re human."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,We’re never going to take political considerations into account or discuss them as part of our work.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,I think anyone who knows the Fed or who has worked at the Fed would recognize that description.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,So that’s very strongly our culture.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"So what we care about—and, really, the only thing we care about at the Fed—is doing our job for the American people and using our tools appropriately."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,How would you respond to those who would suggest that the Fed just caved to the president’s demands?
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"You and your colleagues may have noticed, President Trump, for the past six months, has been urging the Fed not to raise rates—to stop raising rates."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,Jim Puzzanghera with the L.A. Times.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,Thanks.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,JIM PUZZANGHERA.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"And we’ve—I think we’ve played a constructive role in that respect, and I believe that will continue."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"We don’t have plenary authority to just do things, for the most part, in the payment space."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"You know, the thing is, it’s very important in that space to consult with the full range of market participants and interest groups, consumer groups, and we’ve done that, as I’m sure you know, over a period of years."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"As you obviously know, we have some proposals out, and we’re considering them."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"In terms of real-time payments, it’s something we’re very actively working on."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"I will say that we take our enforcement powers very seriously, and we put them to work when we feel it’s justified."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"So, on the first question, I can—we don’t comment on individual investigations or whether they’re happening."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,Right.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"And then, also, I was just wondering if you could say whether there’s any kind of timeline on when the Fed might make a decision on real-time payments and whether you’re going to build a real-time payment system?"
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"I just wanted to ask, first of all, about whether the Fed is gathering information about some of the new money laundering information that’s come out about Deutsche Bank and Danske Bank and whether you have any concerns there?"
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,Victoria Guida with Politico.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,VICTORIA GUIDA.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"We’ve been more of a convener, bringing industry and the public—public interest groups—and all those groups around the table."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,Can you speak specifically to why you’ve moved from a posture of saying we expect to keep raising rates this year to a posture of standing still?
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,So we’re always going to do what we think is the right thing.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,You’ve said today that you think that inflation would be the reason that the Fed would need to continue raising rates.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"There are several different pieces to them, and I think they’re coming—and I’m very pleased with the progress that we’ve made, and, you know, the piece that you mentioned is something that is in those discussions."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,But—so we’ve discussed—there are a number of pieces to that puzzle.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,So I don’t want to get ahead of that process today.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,Let them stand the test of time and argument and then move when you’re really comfortable with what you’ve got and when you feel you can communicate it clearly.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,Let the best ideas rise to the top.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"So there are a lot of pieces to that, and we’ve learned over time that it’s—when making these—when designing these plans, like, for example, the original normalization plan, it’s good to take your time."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"But so the Committee is— what we’re looking to do is create a whole plan that will bring us to our goal, our longer-run goal, which is a balance sheet no larger than it needs to be for us to efficiently conduct— efficiently and effectively conduct monetary policy, but to do so in a way that doesn’t put our goals at risk or result in unnecessary market turmoil."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"So we’re talking about the latter thing, which is discussions, and so I can’t get ahead of where decisions are."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,So today I’m here to talk about decisions and also discussions about decisions that haven’t been made.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,Okay.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"And if you’re not endorsing it, why do you keep mentioning it?"
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,That’s the first question.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"Are you endorsing the market average, which is 3½ trillion?"
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"The second thing is, I have to nail down this thing."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"If so, is that under consideration right now, and when might we know?"
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"Mr. Chairman, did the Committee discuss an actual change to the runoff policy or the runoff schedule right now?"
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"Steve Liesman, CNBC."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,STEVE LIESMAN.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"It wouldn’t be the only thing, but it would certainly be important."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"We’ll be looking at everything, but I do think that, you know, muted inflation pressures—you know, you would want—I would want to see a need for further rate increases, and, for me, a big part of that would be inflation."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"You know, it’s really hard to speak about generalities."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,Your second question was?
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,RICHARD MILLER.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,Has the inflation outlook shifted that dramatically in the last six weeks?
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"You guys, Fed folks, keep mentioning the “market average” or the “market outlook” for the size of the balance sheet."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,I’m not going to give our estimate or ratify anybody else’s estimate of what the equilibrium balance sheet is here today.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"Would it be not just the cessation of those crosscurrents, but the end of these muted inflation pressures—are they both sort of things that are necessary for you to change this “patient” stance?"
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"But there are estimates, and I think they’re consistent with what I said, broadly speaking."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"There are estimates out there, but I’m not at a point today where I’m going to be giving out numbers on that."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,BINYAMIN APPELBAUM.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"There are benefits and costs to doing— to taking different approaches, and I wouldn’t want to prejudge them today."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"And, you know, I wouldn’t comment beyond saying that we understand that’s a key question, and there are, you know, there are issues to be decided."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"We had discussions at one of the last two meetings on this, and we haven’t come to a judgment on that."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"It won’t be the first thing we work on, but it will be one of the first things that we try to resolve."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"Let me say that the question of the ultimate composition of our balance sheet in the longer run is a very important one, and it’s one that we see ourselves as coming to, you know, fairly soon, as in, in coming meetings."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,These are great questions.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,And which approach do you think is more appropriate in the current environment?
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"And so I wonder, what does your staff research show about the degree of accommodation that would be provided by either moving to the front end of the curve and holding or investing, perhaps, in shorter maturity assets, versus the other approach that was identified in the December meeting minutes, which would be to simply reflect issuance of the outstanding Treasury maturities?"
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"So once you are—once you reach the terminal level of reserves and you have to reinvest maturing mortgage-backed securities into Treasuries, it will matter a great deal, of course, where along the curve the Fed resumes those reinvestments."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"Binya Appelbaum, New York Times."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"Chairman Powell, I want to follow up on Steve’s question."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,STEVE LIESMAN.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"The size of the balance sheet obviously matters a great deal, but, so, too, if you follow the arguments that were made when the Fed was purchasing these assets, does the duration of those holdings."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"So, just to clarify—I’m sorry, you did discuss reducing the pace of the runoff?"
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"That sounds like what you said, to me."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,CHAIRMAN POWELL.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"Yes, it’s—so, again, we haven’t made any decisions."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,I am struggling a little bit to understand what has changed since we sat here with you six weeks ago.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"There are different pieces of the thing, and that is in the discussion as one of many pieces that is in the discussion."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,Thanks.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,There no decisions have been made.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal.
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,"And that was reflected in the last minutes, actually."
2019-01-30,Press Conf - Q&A,NICK TIMIRAOS.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,So that’s really our framework.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"What we really mean is that we would look at—we know that inflation will move around on both sides of the target, and what we say is that we would be equally concerned with inflation persistently above as persistently below the target."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"Now, what do we mean by “symmetrical”?"
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,And I don’t feel that we have kind of convincingly achieved our 2 percent mandate in a symmetrical way.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I don’t think we’ve quite achieved that yet, because we’re really 10 years deep in this—almost 10 years—in this expansion, and inflation is still kind of, I’d say, not, you know, clearly meeting our target."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"Our mandate, sorry, is price inflation."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"So—but that’s not price inflation, that’s wage inflation."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"In fact, a lot of the wage gains have been going to lower-paid workers, as can happen late in the cycle, which is also a good thing."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"So wages have moved up in the last couple of years and are now running at healthier, higher levels, and that’s a good thing."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"Let me take wages first, if I can."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,So what I see is inflation that’s close to 2 percent but that sort of keeps bumping up against 2 percent and then maybe moving back down a little bit.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Aren’t—you’re not concerned about it?
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,And rising—why aren’t rising wages feeding into inflation?
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"Chairman Powell, could you talk through your outlook for inflation this year?"
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Greg Robb from MarketWatch.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,GREG ROBB.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"In terms of the size of the balance sheet, the balance sheet will be of a size of approximately 17 percent of GDP around the end of this year, down from 25 percent of GDP at the end of 2014—so, significantly smaller relative to GDP than it was."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we do, again, hope that that can be resolved well, but we know that our banks are well capitalized and resilient to different kinds of events."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"So—and in doing so, we’ve also had—we’ve also worked alongside regulators from the United Kingdom and the EU."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"From our standpoint, the part of it that we can control is that we’ve been involved with supervising our financial institutions that are active either in the United Kingdom or the European Union or both to make sure that they’re ready for the full range of possible outcomes to the—to Brexit."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, of course, we’re watching Brexit carefully and hoping that it can be resolved in an orderly way."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,So that’s one of the reasons why we’re being patient.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"And on the size of the balance sheet, what’s your—do you have a numerical estimate for where it will be at the end of September once the runoff is complete?"
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"I’m guessing you’re looking for a dollar number, though, probably, and that would be—so, for the size of the balance sheet, it looks like it’ll be a bit above $3.5 trillion then."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Chairman Powell."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,GREG ROBB.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Edward Lawrence from Fox Business Network.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,EDWARD LAWRENCE.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"The proximity to the zero lower bound calls for more creative thinking about ways we can, you know, uphold the credibility of our inflation target, and, you know, we’re open minded about ways we can do that."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s one of the—one of the things we’re looking into as part of our strategic monetary policy review this year.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, that’s something that central banks face all over the world, and we certainly face that problem too."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"So if inflation expectations are below 2 percent, they’re always going to be pulling inflation down, and we’re going to be paddling upstream in trying to, you know, keep inflation at 2 percent, which gives us some room to cut, you know, when it’s time to cut rates when the economy weakens."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"It gives central banks less room to, you know, to respond to downturns, right?"
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s one of the major challenges of our time, really, to have inflation—you know, downward pressure on inflation, let’s say."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s a major challenge.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"Yes, thanks."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think, as I’ve said before, I think inflation that is a little bit below our target— particularly headline inflation this year will be, you know, meaningfully below our target for most of the year because of lower oil prices, but we project that core will be too—that gives us the ability to be patient and not move until we see that our target goals are being achieved."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"I’m just kind of curious—I mean, this below-target inflation is a global phenomenon, at least across advanced economies, and I’d just like to kind of hear your thoughts about what kind of challenges that poses to policymakers like yourself and the global economy in general."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks for the question.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,PAUL KIERNAN.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s the record.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"And so, either way, inflation itself has kind of bounced around a little below 2 percent."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"Another is that expectations play a very—inflation expectations play a very key role in our framework and other frameworks, and, you know, there is the possibility that some people discuss of expectations being anchored but below 2 percent."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"That’s one way to think about it, that there’s still more slack in the economy."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,One of them is just that the natural rate of unemployment is lower than people think.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,There’s no real easy answer.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,So there are a bunch of different stories.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"I just wanted to press a little bit about, what is the story the Committee— you know, when you get in the discussion today and yesterday about inflation, what kind of is the story that emerges?"
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Paul Kiernan from Dow Jones Newswires.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"How much of a factor has this been for the Fed in turning towards a kind of patient approach to monetary policy, and what’s your base case on that?"
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,But we’re certainly very mindful of financial conditions and those risks.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,James Politi of the Financial Times.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"There are some aspects of the financial markets that we’re carefully monitoring, and those are in the nature of things that might be amplifiers to a downturn—as opposed to a financial stability concern, which might lead to a financial crisis and that kind of thing, which we don’t see."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I would say, overall, we don’t see financial stability vulnerabilities as high."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,So this is something we have very much on our radar screen.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’re in a very different world today and post-crisis, because we now very carefully monitor financial conditions and financial stability concerns on an ongoing basis, and we publish a report twice a year, and we have quarterly Board meetings and briefings where we look deeply into these things."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"And so, I wonder, does this episode from 20 years ago bear at all on your thinking today about the risks posed by rising asset values in an environment of a shallower policy path?"
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"The S&P, for example, is just 3 percent below last summer’s peak."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,And financial conditions have eased considerably this year since the policy pivot that you made clear in January.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"Chair Powell, in 1998 the Fed eased policy in a way that some say may have avoided a recession, others say may have helped fuel the NASDAQ tech stock bubble."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,NICK TIMIRAOS.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,So we do monitor that.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,So I think our eyes are open on this.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, you know, we’re also patiently watching and waiting and not assuming."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,And that’s really what we’re thinking there.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we look at those fundamentals, and we think that looks like a setting in which consumption will have support from underlying economic fundamentals."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,The household confidence surveys have moved back up to where they were last summer.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s strong economic underlying fundamentals, so, rising wages, high levels of employment, low levels of unemployment, high levels of job creation, confidence."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s 70 percent of the economy, as you point out."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’re not dismissing it in any way, but I would go back to, what is it that supports consumer spending?"
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, it was a surprise, I would say, and inconsistent with a significant amount of other data."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"So on the household side, what we saw was a very weak reading on retail sales in December and then a bounceback in the January reading."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,So I counted five downgrades in the first paragraph of the FOMC statement.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,We’re not taking no signal from the incoming data; that’s why we called it out in our statement.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,There’s huge uncertainty at the moment over the fate of the Brexit negotiations.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I would also say, you know, that the whole question of monetary policy and financial stability is an unsettled and difficult one in our world."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,NICK TIMIRAOS.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,JAMES POLITI.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,And we will have to deal with it eventually.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s not in the nature of a near- term debt crisis or anything like that, and I wouldn’t want to try to predict when that would happen, but it is something that it’s important that the public discussion really come back to, if I can say that."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"So this is something we will have to deal with, and I think we can’t really lose sight of that, and I’d like to see a greater focus on that over time."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"I do think that deficits matter, and I do think—I think it’s not really controversial to say that our debt can’t grow faster than our economy indefinitely and that’s what it’s doing now."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, while the United States might not be quite there yet, when do you begin to worry about a possible credit crisis?"
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,How alarming is that number to you?
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,You’ve previously said that the country is on an unsustainable fiscal path.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"Included in the President’s fiscal 2020 budget is a new estimate that the nation’s debt will balloon to more than $31 trillion over the next decade, by 2029."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Donna Borak with CNN.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"We do think that the principal tools for, you know, for managing financial stability are regulation, supervision, macroprudential tools, and those sorts of things as opposed to changing the interest rate."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,DONNA BORAK.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,They’re far better capitalized and better aware of their risks and more liquid than they were before the financial crisis.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I would say, our banks are well capitalized."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,But we do rely on those tools.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"And when they do clarify, we will act appropriately."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"We also have some tools, like the countercyclical capital buffer, which we can deploy at times when vulnerabilities are meaningfully above normal."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,So those are always on.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"Our financial stability system is built on those tools: high capital, high liquidity, resolution planning, stress testing."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"We—in our system, we mainly rely on “through the cycle” tools like high capital and stress tests."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s a very difficult question with a long answer.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"If I could ask a follow-up—if it’s the case that we’re in a lower neutral interest rate world where you could have more asset price appreciation, do you think the Fed needs more macroprudential tools so that it doesn’t have to lean on monetary policy to do so much?"
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"So they’ll be more resilient in, you know, in difficult states of the economy."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,What conditions do you need to see in order for a rate cut or a rate hike on the other side of that then?
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Brian Cheung with Yahoo Finance.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"Well, we—I think we were—we wanted to be careful to go ahead and acknowledge the things."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"Well, how do you account for the fact that the average maturity has in fact been lengthening and contributing to a flattening of the yield curve?"
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"Can I just follow up, please?"
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,STEVEN BECKNER.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, I think we’re not going to be in a rush to resolve it, but we’ll turn to it soon."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’ve had a lot of balance sheet discussions, as I mentioned, over the last four meetings, but this is the next big one that—big decision that we’ll face."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s a consequential decision and one that needs some thought.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"That, I think, will be something we turn to reasonably soon, but I think it will take some time."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"We have not made that decision, and we’re—we really haven’t begun to have a serious series of discussions over a series of meetings to grapple with that."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,The basic answer to your question is “no.” We are—the decision about the maturity composition of the Fed’s balance sheet in the longer run lies ahead of us.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"And if flattening the yield curve is a conscious long-term strategy, are you concerned about the side effect of the heightening concerns about a flatter or inverted yield curve being a harbinger of recession?"
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Is that—what’s—what’s causing that?
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"Is this aimed at—consciously aimed at flattening the yield curve, and is that going to be part of the Fed’s longer-run balance sheet strategy?"
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"Steve Beckner, freelance journalist reporting for NPR, Mr. Chairman."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,STEVEN BECKNER.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mean, our policy is—the reason we’re on hold is that we think our policy rate is in a good place, and we think the economy is in a good place, and we’re watching carefully as we see these events evolve around the world and at home, and we think that’s what we need to be doing."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s just an external fact about the economy for us.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,So I think it’s just a fact.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"We don’t evaluate it, we don’t criticize it, and we don’t overreact to it either."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, in other words, whatever happens with fiscal policy, we take that."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we take—we take fiscal policy as, you know, as exogenous to what we do."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"I’m asking because we’re seeing the waning effect of tax reform and no material news on infrastructure, so just wondering kind of how you feel the monetary policy–fiscal policy balance is in swing right now."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"So as the Fed remains on pause, does the central bank find the onus on fiscal policy to extend its economic recovery and fend off a slowdown—as in, is the Fed positioning itself to take on a reactionary role to whatever fiscal policy is doing?"
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,The Fed has been allowing the average maturity of securities in its bond portfolio to lengthen.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks for taking my question.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s not at all a plan to lengthen the balance sheet.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"Given how big of a part of the U.S. economy that is, what gives you, kind of, confidence that both the slowdown we’re seeing is temporary?"
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, I’m just going to say that I think we’re in a good place right now, which is, we’re being patient, we’re watching, we don’t see any data pushing us to move rates in either direction, and we’re going to watch carefully and patiently as we allow events to evolve."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"As I’m sure you know, the market listens to you very, very closely."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Are you concerned at all what the market impact will be should the Fed resume policy tightening somewhere down the line?
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Courtenay Brown from Axios.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Mr. Chairman."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,COURTENAY BROWN.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"I wouldn’t want to put a time out there for that, but—so I’ll just leave it there."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,So we’ll just have to see.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,It may evolve over time.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think, isn’t it just that as securities roll off, you wind up investing in—you know, as a 10-year rolls off, you wind up investing in a 10-year, and automatically that lengthens things."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"The truth is, we don’t know."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"The truth is, we don’t know, and we don’t really know that we’ll move past September 30th."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"And the question you’re asking is, how long will that go on?"
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"And then what’ll happen is, organically, very gradually, currency and other nonreserved liabilities will grow, and reserves will shrink."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"And if it is our view at that time that we’re still a ways away from—a ways above a balance sheet that is what we need to efficiently and effectively conduct monetary policy, at that time we will hold the balance sheet constant."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, as I—as I mentioned, the balance sheet runoff will stop at about—at September 30."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,What are—how will you make that decision?
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"I wanted to ask, at what point do you expect to begin to allow the balance sheet to grow slowly again?"
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Jean Yung with Market News."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,JEAN YUNG.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s just been—we try to have a practice that we don’t deviate from, and it’s transparent, and—no policy message in that."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"The level of reserve demand is something that we’ve put a lot of effort and time into creating estimates, based on market intelligence and surveys and that kind of thing."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Chair Powell."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"But the sense of our tapering is that—“tailoring,” sorry—our tailoring policy is that the highest expectations fall upon the largest, most systemically important, most complex institutions, and then at every step along the way, the expectations become more tailored to the risks that that institution actually presents to the economy."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Just a quick follow-up on Brexit.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Nancy Marshall-Genzer with Marketplace.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,I don’t think we tie it particularly to the relationship you’re talking about.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,And we also monitor financial stability very carefully across all meaningful asset categories.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"I don’t think we look at—I understand what you’re asking, but we’re looking at—our mandate is price inflation and maximum employment, and that’s what we’re looking at with setting interest rates."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"More generally, to the extent that wage growth in excess of interest rates allows households to pay down debt faster, whereas interest rates in excess of wage growth risks a further buildup in debt, how do you account for the sort of financial stability consequences of varying interest rates relative to wage growth?"
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,MATTHEW BOESLER.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, nonetheless, I don’t see the current wage picture as concerning from an inflation standpoint."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"It does—you know, in theory, it can squeeze corporate margins, and, you know, that can’t go on indefinitely."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,You mentioned that you’re making sure that U.S. financial institutions are ready for whatever outcome.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’ve had—also had—in other cycles, we’ve had situations where, you know, unit labor costs were moving up above inflation, and that didn’t lead to price inflation."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I’m wondering if, going forward, given these insights about the labor share and high profit margins and the linkage between wages and prices, would you be in favor of allowing wage growth to continue accelerating without matching that with higher interest rates?"
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, so far throughout this tightening cycle, the Fed 2 Chair Powell intended to point to the weak reading on retail sales for December 2018. has not allowed wage growth to rise above longer-term interest rates until just very recently."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Fed Vice Chairman Rich Clarida has talked about how the decline in labor’s share of income and the corresponding high profit margins might mean that lower unemployment and higher wage growth is not flowing through to price inflation the way it used to.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Matthew Boesler at Bloomberg.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Hi.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,MATTHEW BOESLER.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"When the time comes, we’ll act appropriately."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,They suggest that we should remain patient and let the situation clarify itself over time.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, and in terms of what it would take, I’d say, again, today we don’t see any—we don’t see data coming in that suggests that we should move in either direction."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think it’s relatively little hard data so far this year, but we were careful to point out lower retail sales—the weak November meeting—BFI, all those things, and I think that was the right thing to do.2 Notwithstanding that, we do have a positive outlook for the year for the reasons I mentioned—you know, solid underlying economic fundamentals, et cetera."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"Well, let me say that we’ve had, you know, a significant move up in wages and compensation over the last few years, and I—which does not trouble me from the standpoint of inflation."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,So— BRIAN CHEUNG.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"I’m wondering, can you be a little more specific about that?"
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"So if you think about it, you know, if you’re a medium-sized bank and you merge with another medium-sized bank, you wind up being more than a medium-sized bank, you know."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"I would also say, when banks merge and move into a larger asset category, they get stronger regulation, not weaker regulation."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,So that’s how we think about that.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,I think we want to have banks of all different sizes and with different business models out there carrying out their functions in the economy.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,We’re not motivated by a particular view of industry structure that we’re trying to achieve through our regulation.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,I’m curious if the Fed anticipated that outcome and whether you have any reservations or whether you—the Fed cares about bank consolidation more generally.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"Some analysts have suggested that that proposal could encourage consolidation mergers and acquisition among banks, particularly at the upper end of the range."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,I have a question about the Fed’s proposal from October of last year regarding enhanced prudential standards for banks above $250 billion.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,John Heltman—John Heltman with American Banker.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Hi.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"And also, how are you preparing for any pressures that a hard Brexit would put on the U.S. dollar?"
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,JOHN HELTMAN.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we don’t—you know, we—the dollar is really the business of the Treasury Department."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,And as far as the dollar goes?
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,So we’re very watchful about what’s going on.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"That said, nothing like this has happened in recent years, and so it’s really hard to be confident."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,So I think all that has probably prepared our institutions well.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"So that’s a good thing to have done, knowing that you’re going into something that’s quite unknown, which may prove stressful, it may not prove stressful, depending on what the outcome is."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"So that’s a pretty good—you know, having done that for a number of years now, that’s—and having them be required to have adequate capital and liquidity even after all that happens."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,And we vary that every year.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"Well, as I mentioned, you know, with the stress tests that the largest financial institutions—and those are the ones that tend to be active internationally—that they undergo every year, we put them through very large financial shocks with large losses and big changes in markets every year."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s certainly a financial condition unto itself that plays into our models, but we don’t, you know, seek or model or attempt to affect the dollar directly with our policies."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"Just—you mentioned that you have, kind of, a positive outlook as it regards the economy but also see slower growth on the household side and the business side."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,I think it’s clear that the tax and spending policies that were adopted early last year supported demand in a significant way last year.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,TREVOR HUNNICUTT.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,STEVE LIESMAN.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,And we’re not really thinking of those as two different tools of monetary policy.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"As far as balance sheet—the balance sheet plan, the answer to that is, you asked whether that’s related to our monetary policy, in effect, and the answer is really “no.” We are—we still— we think of the interest rate tool as the principal tool of monetary policy, and we think of ourselves as returning the balance sheet to a normal level over the course of the next six months."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,So we see the outlook as a positive one.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"You have confidence surveys for households and also for businesses that are at attractive levels, and you also have financial conditions that are more accommodative than they were a couple of months ago."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,You’ve got very low unemployment.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,You have rising incomes.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,You have a strong labor market by most measures.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,And part of that is seeing that economic fundamentals—underlying economic fundamentals are still very strong.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, as I mentioned, FOMC participants continue to see growth this year of around 2 percent, just a bit below what we saw back in—at the end of last year."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, on the outlook, our outlook is a positive one."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"Steve Liesman, CNBC."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Some of the actions today look like there is more worry.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"On the broader economy, can you clarify how worried the FOMC is about a steep slowdown?"
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Heather Long from the Washington Post.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,HEATHER LONG.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,And I will be glad to take your questions.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,We maintain our long- stated intention to return to a portfolio consisting mainly of Treasury securities.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"The Committee will soon turn to a few remaining normalization topics, including the desired maturity composition of our portfolio of Treasury securities."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"We believe that these plans will facilitate a predictable, transparent, and smooth process, and we will make additional adjustments if conditions warrant."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"When the Committee judges that reserves should not decline further, securities holdings will again begin to rise, as dictated by the growth of demand for our reserve and nonreserve liabilities."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"During this time, ongoing gradual increases in currency and our other nonreserve liabilities would imply very gradual declines in reserve balances."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"And on the balance sheet, can you clarify: Does the FOMC see the runoff as a form of monetary tightening?"
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"If this is so, we may hold the size of our asset holdings roughly constant for a time."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"Mr. Chairman, can you talk about how global developments are affecting the U.S.?"
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,How much is it responsible for the downgrade in GDP over here?
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s very hard to tease that apart.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s hard to say how much of an effect that’s having on our economy.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"We have, since the beginning of the year—and before, really—been hearing from our extensive network of business contacts a lot of concerns about tariffs, concerns about material costs on imported products, and the loss of markets and things like that, depending on which industry, so there’s a fair amount of uncertainty."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"In terms of our own economy, the level of tariffs is relatively small in the size of our economy—relative to the size of our economy."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,I think the main factors are the delevering campaign that the government undertook a couple of years ago and also just the longer-term slowing to a more sustainable pace of growth that economies find as they mature.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,I don’t think they’re the main factor.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"I would say, tariffs may be a factor in China."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,You ask about tariffs.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"And in Europe, you know, we see some weakening, but, again, we don’t see—we don’t see recession, and we do see positive growth still."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"Chinese authorities have taken many steps since the middle of last year to support economic activity, and I think the base case is that, ultimately, Chinese activity will stabilize at an attractive level."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"The main point, though, is that, I would say, the outlook—let’s look at the outlook."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,What’s the cause of the weakness over there?
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"In China, you have, you know, factors that are very specific to China."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"It is an integrated global economy, and global financial markets are integrated as well."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s hard to be precise about it, but, clearly, we will feel that."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,How big is that effect?
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"And just as strong global growth was a tailwind, weaker global growth can be a headwind to our economy."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"What happened instead is that the global economy started to gradually slow, and now we see a situation where the European economy has slowed substantially—and so has the Chinese economy, although the European economy more."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,And we began 2018 expecting and hoping for more of the same.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,That was the year of synchronized global growth.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,So the global economy was a tailwind for the United States in 2017.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"And what impact are tariffs, both in the United States and retaliatory tariffs, having on both the U.S. and the global economies?"
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"In terms of what’s causing it, it seems to be a range of different things."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"But I will say, it’s been a prominent concern among our business contacts for some time now."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"In September, reserve balances may still be somewhat above the level required to conduct policy efficiently and effectively."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"Since October 2017, we have been allowing our asset holdings to decline by not reinvesting all of the payments we receive as securities matured or were prepaid."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"Weak retail sales data for December bounced back considerably in January but, on balance, seem to point to somewhat slower growth in consumer spending."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Many other labor market indicators continue to show strength.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"Smoothing through these variations, average monthly job growth appears to have stepped down from last year’s strong pace, but job gains remain well above the pace necessary to provide jobs for new labor force entrants."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Unusually strong payroll job growth in January was followed by little growth at all in February.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"While the U.S. economy showed little evidence of slowdown through the end of 2018, the limited data we have so far this year have been somewhat more mixed."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"Growth has slowed in some foreign economies—notably, in Europe and China."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"While conditions have eased since then, they remain less supportive of growth than during most of 2018."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Financial conditions tightened considerably over the fourth quarter.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Data arriving since September suggest that growth is slowing somewhat more than expected.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"For example, last September, Committee participants saw growth coming in at about 2.5 percent this year."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"For some time, most forecasts have called for growth to continue in 2019 at a somewhat lower but still healthy pace."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Business fixed investment also appears to be growing at a slower pace than last year.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"With the benefit of fiscal stimulus and other tailwinds, growth in 2018 was strong—in fact, at 3.1 percent, the strongest year in more than a decade."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"Given the overall favorable conditions in our economy, my colleagues and I will be patient in assessing what, if any, changes in the stance of policy may be needed."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,We believe that our current policy stance is appropriate.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"We continue to expect that the American economy will grow at a solid pace in 2019, although likely slower than the very strong pace of 2018."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"The unemployment rate is near historic lows, and inflation remains near our 2 percent goal."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"The jobs market is strong, showing healthier wage gains and prompting many people to join or remain in the workforce."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"The U.S. economy is in a good place, and we will continue to use our monetary policy tools to help keep it there."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"My colleagues and I have one overarching goal: to sustain the economic expansion, with a strong job market and stable prices, for the benefit of the American people."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,I will begin with an overview of economic conditions and an explanation of the decisions the Committee made at today’s meeting.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"Transcript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference March 20, 2019 CHAIR POWELL."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Trevor Hunnicutt from Reuters.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Let me explain in more detail how incoming data warrant our current stance and a wait-and-see approach to changes.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Today we announced that we intend to slow the runoff of our assets starting in May and to cease runoff entirely in September of this year.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"Inflation has been muted, and some indicators of longer-term inflation expectations remain at the low end of their ranges in recent years."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Much of the discussion at our meeting focused on what we should make of the varied indicators.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, for now, I’ll summarize the key elements."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"The plans have many technical details, and I’ll be happy to answer questions on those details."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Today’s announcement is the result of discussions over the past four FOMC meetings about how best to achieve these goals.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"We have sought to make the normalization process transparent, predictable, and gradual in order to minimize disruption and risks to our dual-mandate objectives."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,We have long said that the size of the balance sheet will be considered normalized when the balance sheet is once again at the smallest level consistent with conducting monetary policy efficiently and effectively.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Today the Committee released Balance Sheet Normalization Principles and Plans— revised Balance Sheet Normalization Principles and Plans.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"As Chair Yellen noted some years ago, the FOMC statement, rather than the dot plot, is the device that the Committee uses to express its opinions about the likely path of rates."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,They are not a Committee plan.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thus, we always emphasize that the interest rate projections in the SEP are not a Committee decision."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,These and other scenarios and many other considerations go into policy but are not reflected in projections of the most likely case.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"We also discuss other plausible scenarios, including the risk of more worrisome outcomes."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"Along with these developments, unresolved policy issues, such as Brexit and the ongoing trade negotiations, pose some risks to the outlook."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Views about the most likely scenario form one input into our policy discussions.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"In discussing the Committee’s projections, it’s useful to note what those projections are, as well as what they are not."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,It may be some time before the outlook for jobs and inflation calls clearly for a change in policy.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,“Patient” means that we see no need to rush to judgment.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"As I noted, my colleagues and I think that this setting is well suited to the current outlook and believe that we should be patient in assessing the need for any change in the stance of policy."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,The federal funds rate is now in the broad range of estimates of neutral—the rate that tends neither to stimulate nor to restrain the economy.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"Now, I’m describing views of the most likely outcomes, but historical experience reminds us that growth and inflation this year could be stronger or weaker than what we now project."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"Declines in oil prices since last fall are expected to push headline inflation below 2 percent for a time, but this effect is likely to be temporary."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"Core inflation, which omits the effects of volatile food and energy prices, remains close to 2 percent."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"FOMC participants sought—now see 2019 growth at roughly 2 percent, with the unemployment rate remaining below 4 percent."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"And these views are in line with a broad range of other forecasts and point to a modest slowdown, with overall conditions remaining favorable."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"Today’s Summary of Economic Projections, the SEP, reflects the assessments of individual Committee participants."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"The SEP includes participants’ individual projections of the most likely economic scenario, along with their views of the appropriate path of the federal funds rate in that scenario."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,JAMES PUZZANGHERA.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"Since last year, however, we have noted some developments at home and around the world that bear close attention."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you, Chairman."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,You still have one showing for next year.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"With the new dot plot today, you’ve gone from two rate hikes in 2019 to zero."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Marty Crutsinger with the Associated Press.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,MARTIN CRUTSINGER.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"I wouldn’t want to be handing—you know, assigning credit or blame for that, but I do think that the performance of labor force participation over the last, really, three or four years has been an upside surprise that most people didn’t see coming, and it’s extremely welcome."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, the idea would be that lowering corporate taxes would spur more corporate investment, which would spur more productivity, and lowering individual taxes would spur greater labor force participation."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think it’s hard to know, it’s hard to identify those with any precision, and we hope they’re—we hope they’re very large."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"And it’s also the case, I think, that they should have some supply-side effects."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,I would say so.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Do you see the tax cuts—the 2017 tax cuts as having provided a large boost to labor force participation as the White House does?
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"The fed funds futures trading, as has been alluded to, is showing rate cuts at the end of this year."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,A quick follow-up on that.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s quite hard to know with any precision, and I just would like to see us, you know, undertake an effort to make it be as high as it can sustainably be."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, I guess I would say, what is the potential growth rate?"
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s a function of evolving technology.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s very difficult to project productivity over long stretches of time.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Productivity is much harder.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,So I would like to see that.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"If we can bring more people into the labor force and give them a chance to contribute to and benefit from our overall prosperity, that will be a great thing for the country."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,And that’s a place where we can grow faster.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"The United States is now one of the lowest countries among the advanced economies, in terms of our labor force participation by prime-age workers."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,And I’ve been calling—often mentioning these days that it would be great if we had national-level policies to support higher labor force participation.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,You can really think of growth as those two things.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,JIM TANKERSLEY.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,And the other is productivity—it’s output per hour.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"Are they—is that a possibility in your mind, given the sharp change you’ve made at this meeting?"
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"As I mentioned, the data that we’re seeing are not currently sending a signal which suggests moving in either direction for me, which is really why we’re being patient."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Hi.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’ll always be trying to reach consensus, and, you know, I’m committed to that."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s nothing but healthy from my standpoint.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"In the end, it’s very healthy to have disparate views and to state them publicly and put them on the record."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,We try very hard to reach consensus on things.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"In terms of having disparate views, I—look, we try—we are very much a consensus- driven organization."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,It shouldn’t be a big surprise—something we’ve been talking about doing for a couple of years.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I think, given the level that the banks have moved to in capital planning, we did that."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,We’ve been talking about that for quite a while.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"And for, really, some time now, for a couple of years, we’ve talked about moving supervision of that process—moving to a supervisory approach to that rather than having a pass/fail in the stress tests."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,And U.S.—the large U.S. financial institutions have made significant progress there and are now much better at the capital planning process.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,So you mentioned the qualitative aspect of CCAR.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"based organization, if you keep having these decisions where, you know, a Board member is not onboard with them?"
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"Does it concern you, given that the Fed has traditionally been a consensus- 1 Chair Powell intended to say that the unemployment rate is under 4 percent."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"And then, also, Governor Brainard dissented on that decision, and she’s dissented on some other decisions as well regulatorily recently."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"On stress testing, I wanted to ask, how do you respond to criticism that the Fed’s recent move to remove the qualitative objection from CCAR makes it less transparent to the general public?"
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Victoria Guida with Politico.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Hi.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,VICTORIA GUIDA.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Unemployment is under 3 percent.1 It’s a great time for us to be patient and watch and wait and see how things evolve.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Inflation is close to target.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,The economy is growing at about trend.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,We feel our policy rate is in the range of neutral.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,And one is really growth in the workforce—more hours worked.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"For banks that are newer to CCAR and haven’t made that kind of progress, then they’re still going to be part of—they’re still going to have a qualitative test until they can reach similar levels of achievement."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,I would take it this way.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,What do you think the risks actually are?
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,How far off are the markets?
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"I know you said that the outlook among the Committee members is a positive one, but since the end of the meeting, the 3-month–10-year Treasury spread has fallen to 7 basis points, and now, according to fed funds futures trading, there’s a 50 percent chance of a rate cut by next January."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,I wonder if you could discuss the balance of risks.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Michael McKee with Bloomberg Radio and Television.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHAEL MCKEE.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,And we will supervise based on that.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"We do supervise boards of directors for, you know, for having a set of compensation practices that don’t reward short-term risk-taking and that sort of thing."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,We don’t approve individual pay packages.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, our main supervisory focus is on the company fixing its risk-management approach and fundamentally rebuilding that approach."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"Well, first, the data are not currently sending a signal that we need to move in one direction or another, in my view."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,JAMES PUZZANGHERA.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,And that’s not where we are right now.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we put in place, really, an unprecedented sanction in the form of an asset growth cap, and we will not lift that until Wells Fargo gets their arms around this, comes forward with plans, implements those plans, and we’re satisfied with what they’ve done."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,So there’s a lot of work to do on that.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"And as it’s gone on and on, it’s become clear that—I think some time ago it became clear that these are deep problems that needed to be addressed in a fundamental kind of a way."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"So what happened at Wells Fargo really was a remarkably widespread series of breakdowns, really, in their risk-management apparatus, which resulted in significant consumer abuses, let’s say."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"Do you have concerns about Wells Fargo’s efforts to fix its problems, and do you expect the asset cap to remain in place beyond this year?"
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"Wells Fargo last week announced that its chief executive received a 5 percent pay raise last year, and this comes among continued settlements by the bank of various consumer abuse and reports that new consumer-unfriendly sales incentives are returning."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,You can think of growth as being composed of two things.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,I want to switch gears temporarily to Wells Fargo.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"Do you believe it’s appropriate—do you believe it’s appropriate for the CEO to be getting a pay raise in light of those conditions, in terms of corporate governance?"
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"I would say it this way: We see a positive outlook for this year, a favorable outlook for this year, as I mentioned."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Wells Fargo.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,They see unemployment remaining below 4 percent.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, in our SEP projections, Committee members, participants, generally see growth of around 2 percent."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"Why, for one, do you see—do you think you see the economy so differently than they do, and do you worry at all about implications for policy from that?"
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"I’m curious, you’re now a full percentage point—actually, more than a percentage point—below the White House in your projections for growth this year."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"Jim Tankersley, New York Times."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Mr. Chairman."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,JIM TANKERSLEY.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,So that’s really how we’re thinking about it.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,I wouldn’t comment on their projection.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"On the other hand, as I mentioned, we see the underlying economic fundamentals for growth this year as still very positive."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, the limited data that we have do show a slowdown."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"By my calculations, that’s the largest spread we’ve seen since the end of the recession between the White House and the Fed."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,We’re also carefully monitoring what’s happening with U.S. growth.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,They see inflation remaining close to target.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,We called that out in our statement.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"And they see growth, as I said, around 2 percent."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, you know, that’s a positive outlook."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s a favorable outlook.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,I haven’t—I haven’t seen their projection.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,And you see—you mentioned some of them.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, you see slowing global growth."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,You still have—there’s no resolution of Brexit.
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"There’s no resolution, really, of the trade talks."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’re also very mindful—and we have been, of course, all along—of what the risks are."
2019-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,These are ongoing risks.
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,I’d like to know what you would say to people who worry that it will prove difficult for the Fed to lift inflation without potentially stoking another asset bubble of some sort.
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Manufacturing has been weak all around the world.
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Yes, we see that reading as—it’s still a positive reading and consistent with what we expect from the manufacturing sector, which is moderate or perhaps modest growth."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"This is the ISM reading, I guess from this morning, on manufacturing."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mean, how much weight does it hold for you, and is it a sign that monetary policy might be too tight?"
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,So isn’t that a dark cloud on your outlook for strong growth for the rest of the year?
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"This morning, the ISM manufacturing index fell to have its worst reading since October 2016."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Greg Robb from MarketWatch.
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"You mentioned the connection to financial stability of lower-for-longer rates, and that is another challenge."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"As I mentioned earlier, we do consider financial stability concerns to the extent they threaten achievement of our goals, but we also view, and I do take the view that macroprudential and supervisory tools, regulatory tools, things like the stress tests that we can do right through the cycle—those are really the best defense against financial instability so that the financial system is highly resilient to the kinds of financial shocks that can happen."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"And that’s one of the reasons we’re having a review of our monetary policy strategies, tools, and communications this year—to think about that problem."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"One, I would say, is, it means that interest rates will be lower— will be closer to the effective lower bound more of the time because that means lower interest rates."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"And that includes us, although we’ve actually done— we’ve come closer, I think, than most others."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"So you’re pointing to, really, the fact that in recent years inflation has moved down and down, and, really, many major central banks have struggled to reach their inflation goals from below."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Yes.
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Services have been growing faster.
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,GREG ROBB.
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"And it’s just a question, I think, of demographic and other large and, in some cases, global forces that are disinflationary to some extent, and it creates significant challenges."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"So if you look at consumer spending, you saw stronger retail sales, stronger motor vehicle sales in March."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,EDWARD LAWRENCE.
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"I don’t know, though."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"So that, I think—that would be my expectation."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"In the last 23 years, core PCE inflation has run above 2 percent only during the period that coincided with the housing bubble."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, I don’t think—it wouldn’t be the kind of thing where you’d immediately feel big effects right away, but they could be quite important over a longer period."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, of course, most of the gains, though, I would expect, even from a successful trade negotiation, would come in over time."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,So that would be a positive.
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"If you import metals or whatever for your product or export your product, then it’s been a challenge for you."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"We have been hearing from our business contacts, really, a lot since the beginning of the trade negotiations that uncertainty is a concern."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"In terms of the effect of trade deals, I think one thing would be that the resolution of the uncertainty around these trade negotiations would, I would guess, be a positive for business sentiment."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,And business investment should also be positive in that sort of direction.
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"So it’s—yes, it’s something that we are watching carefully, but we do expect a positive contribution to growth from the manufacturing sector."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,So that’s a significant part of the outlook this year.
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, as I mentioned, the conditions, the broader economic fundamentals, are strong in support of consumer spending—that’s more accommodative financial conditions, high confidence readings, high levels of employment, wages going up."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I would say that the basis for that, really, is consumer spending and business investment."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Our outlook and my outlook is for—is a positive one, is a healthy one for the U.S. economy for growth for the rest of this year."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,And could these trade deals turn into tailwinds for the economy?
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Could you talk about a little bit of the domestic growth that you’re seeing going forward for the rest of the year?
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"You mentioned that the progress in the talks with China trade, progress in talks with Japanese trade, the USMCA is moving or going to move through Congress."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,You mentioned—talked about domestic growth a little bit with the economy.
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for doing this."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Edward Lawrence from Fox Business.
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,All those things are going to support consumer spending.
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks for the question.
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,MARTIN CRUTSINGER.
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,PAUL KIERNAN.
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mean, the situations were quite different then."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Similarities in the length.
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Do you see similarities in today’s situation?
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Do you see parallels with the 1990s, when—for example, some people have pointed out, in the U.S., the longest expansion before this one, there was a rate cut in 1995, and rates went up, and then they came down, and there was that kind of management."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,STEVE MATTHEWS.
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,So I see us on a good path for this year.
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Inflation is low, which gives us the ability to be patient, and we do expect it to move up, and we want it to move up to 2 percent."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,We see wages moving up.
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,We see job creation.
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,The labor market is strong.
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Growth is at a healthy level.
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,All I can see is that we have an economy where the expansion is continuing.
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,So things are possible.
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"There’s always the example of Australia that everyone, I think, is aware of, where I think they’re in year 28 of their expansion."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, I wouldn’t want to speculate."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"And for you personally, if we had a recession during your tenure, would you consider that a failure?"
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Do you think that’s something that’s practical for the U.S., that we could have that kind of lengthy expansion?"
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"I haven’t seen—none of us, at least I haven’t seen, the details of what’s been negotiated."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Next month, we have the 10th anniversary of the end of the recession, and there are some countries that have had expansions for 15, 20, 25 years."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"This was before inflation really was under control, but, you know, it’s very interesting to look at the history."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,I find it quite interesting to look at different periods.
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"But I think, in our own cycle, we face a particular set of challenges that are really what’s relevant for us now."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Mr. Chairman, Marty Crutsinger with the AP."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,We don’t discuss them.
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,We don’t let them into our decisionmaking.
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,We don’t think about other factors.
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s how we think about things.
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,But that’s our process.
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Of course, we’ll not hesitate if we do feel that the data justify moving in either direction."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,So we don’t feel like the data’s pushing us in either direction.
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we also see, by the way, the evolving-risk picture as very consistent with that outlook."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we think our monetary policy stance is in a good place, and we’re going to be patient as we consider adjustments."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"And in this particular case, we came to a unanimous decision, after an extensive discussion, that our monetary policy stance is appropriate where it is."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Paul Kiernan from Dow Jones Newswires.
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"We go away, we think about that, and we come back, and the next day we talk about monetary policy."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"The first day begins with an economic briefing, which is, sort of, economic and financial developments in the United States and around the world."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"We put all that together, and we come together for two days."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"As you also are I’m sure aware, Marty, we talk to literally thousands of businesspeople and market people and people in the nonprofit sector and the educational sector just to get a better sense of the economy."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"So to give you an idea of what our process is like, maybe as a way of putting all that in context—so for the past maybe 10 days, all 17 FOMC members will have made extensive preparations: catching up on the latest data, reading all the memos, talking to their colleagues and their staff."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"And what we’re always solving for in our process, in our work, is to carry out our mission, which is to extend the economic expansion, keep the labor market strong, and get inflation around 2 percent."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Yes, so, as you know, we are a nonpolitical institution, and that means we don’t think about short-term political considerations, we don’t discuss them, and we don’t consider them in making our decisions one way or the other."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"What do those comments do, in terms of affecting how you pursue policy and how you convey your decisions to the public?"
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Yesterday, he said you should cut rates a full percentage point and start quantitative easing."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"You’ve repeatedly said that the Fed’s going to conduct monetary policy without regard to outside political pressure, but it seems like the President is intent on increasing that political pressure."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"That takes up most of the first day, and we talk about this in great detail."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,DON LEE.
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,So that’s that.
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Getting back to inflation, can you talk more about the transitory factors holding down inflation, how significant they are, and why you think those factors will pass?"
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"For example, the median projection in the March meeting for GDP growth for 2019 was 2.1, so I’m just kind of curious about what you see going forward if we continue to see strong GDP numbers."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"So given what you’ve said about the expectations for consumption and also business fixed investment perhaps bouncing back in the next GDP reading, I’m wondering if you think that continued growth in economic activity might show some sort of underlying fundamental that could flag another overheating."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Brian Cheung with Yahoo Finance.
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Hi there.
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,BRIAN CHEUNG.
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"And in terms of what all it’s going to be, it’s not something I can say with any certainty yet."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,I don’t really have a date though.
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,I know they’re making good progress.
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,I really don’t have a lot for you.
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, we put out a proposal on Volcker some time ago, and we got a lot of comments, and we’re reviewing them carefully."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Can you give any indication how close the agencies are to coming to a solution and what that solution might look like, whether it would be starting from scratch entirely or making changes to the original proposal?"
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"On the regulatory side, the Fed and other bank regulators are said to be weighing all options for retooling a proposal to revise the Volcker rule."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hannah Lang, American Banker."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,HANNAH LANG.
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"But that’s something we’ll do at an upcoming meeting, I would imagine."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,And then probably come back and make a decision.
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Again, I wouldn’t say—it would just be a way for us to do what we do, which is to do a deep dive on it, think carefully about it, look at the pros and cons, look at the different possible ways to do it, and then go away and think about it for a little while."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"I don’t have any presupposition that it’s something we would do, but we’ll be taking a look at it as a possible addition to our toolbox."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"In terms of other tools, we’re actually—I’m sure at an upcoming meeting we will be looking at the idea of a repo facility."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Well, we don’t see any evidence at all of overheating, for one thing."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"We see inflation below 2 percent now—as I mentioned, pretty close to 2 percent for most of last year."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, really, no signs of overheating."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"If you look at the labor market, for a long time now there have been anecdotal reports of labor shortages and difficulty in finding skilled labor and that kind of thing."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Steve Matthews with Bloomberg.
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks very much.
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"It suggests that a less tight economy, a less, you know—may be part of the explanation for lower inflation."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,And that does suggest more room to grow.
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Really, there has been a significant positive supply-side development over the last year and a half between the uptick in labor force participation, which goes back several years, but also productivity."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"In fact, I’ll mention, if we’re talking about the supply side, labor force participation."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,So I think it’s positive.
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"I don’t know if that level can be sustained, but we really— it’s driven, to some extent, by technological developments and, really, the diffusion of technology through the economy, and it’s very hard to predict."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Last year, we had 1.9 percent productivity, which is much higher."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"But I will say this: Productivity was very, very low in the wake of the crisis for six or seven years."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Effective, I guess, today, we’re cutting the roll-off rate for Treasuries in half just because we want to take our time and move gradually here."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"No one has been able to predict it successfully, so I won’t really try."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,You mentioned productivity.
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Just for the last couple of years, the biggest part of the gains have come for people at the lowest end of compensation and education, which is kind of a welcome thing."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Yes—in terms of wages getting over 4 percent, wages have moved up pretty steadily over the last five years and are now—wages and benefits are now between 3 and 3½ percent."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Can you kind of give us a read on—but more substantively, can you give us a read on how the Committee views productivity growth, if it’s accelerating enough?"
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Are wages ever going to get back above 4 percent in this cycle?
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,HEATHER LONG.
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, really not seeing signs of overheating at the moment."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s not higher than that rate that would incorporate both inflation and productivity.
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Nonetheless, you have very strong job creation, and you have wages moving up at a rate that is appropriate, given inflation and given productivity, but not at all signaling any overheating at all."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,So productivity is really very difficult to predict.
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Don Lee with the L.A. Times.
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s why we tapered the roll-off to only $15 billion in Treasuries per month.
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,There’s no roadmap.
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’re going to be watching—really, I’d like to say we’re going to be watching inflation carefully to see that these things are transient, and I’ll end by saying we are strongly committed to the 2 percent inflation objective."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, again, we’ll have to see here."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we kind of thought so and said so, and then, sure enough, in 2018, we had those months of 2 percent inflation."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Many of you will remember, in March of 2017, there was a very low reading for cell phone services—mobile phone services—and it was kind of a price war, and it dragged down core inflation for a full year, but it did not look like something that would be repeated."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,I would point to the case of cell phone services.
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"We, of course, will be watching very carefully to see that that is the case."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,So there’s reason to think that these will be transient.
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s at 2 percent—or it’s at, I don’t know whether it went down or was above that, but it’s at 2 percent now."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"So trimmed mean—it cuts off the big movements on the upside and the downside and looks at just the mean movements in inflation of various product categories and service categories, and it didn’t go down at all."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"And another way to look at it is, there are models that look at inflation in different ways, like—not models, but measures, like the Dallas trimmed mean, as I mentioned."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we don’t know until, again, until we see, but there’s reason to think that those would be transient and would turn around."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,There are many little things.
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,And another one is airfares.
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,There was a change in the methodology.
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Other ones that get mentioned are things like apparel, and apparel prices were very, very low."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"And so when asset prices went back up, probably there’ll be a swing around there, a positive contribution."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"One that I would mention is portfolio management services, which would tend to go down when asset prices go down, with a lag."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Let me say, I don’t mean to diminish concerns about too-low inflation, but I think there’s good reason to think that these readings are particularly influenced by some transitory factors."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Well, I would just mention a couple."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Sure.
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER.
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Just following up, Chair Powell."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Nancy Marshall- Genzer with Marketplace.
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"You were saying if inflation does stay low and these low inflation rates are not transient, you said a couple times you’ll take that into account with monetary policy."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,And so I—there is no template for this.
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,And we’re right at that point where we’re starting to learn more and more about what the real demand for reserves is over the next few months.
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mean, we’re—with—the balance sheet is now—the size of it is going to be driven by demand for liabilities, principally reserves, as I mentioned."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Don’t expect to need to do it again, but we don’t know."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,We’ll do that.
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"If we need to, and as needed, we will use our tools to keep the federal funds rate somewhere in the target range."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"There have been other ideas floated, like the standing repo facility and targeting a different benchmark rate."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"And then, can you speak to any other strategies or tools that might be useful for keeping a ceiling on short-term interest rates?"
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"If the fed funds rate keeps rising, do you see room for another IOER adjustment?"
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"We just have to do it, and that’s why we’re moving so very gradually."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Jean Yung with Market News."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,I can’t really be any more specific than what I’ve said.
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,So a cut in interest rates would be possible?
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER.
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we would be concerned, and we’d take it into account."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Stable prices is half of our mandate, and we’ve defined that as 2 percent."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Ultimately, there are many variables to be taken into account at any given time, but that’s part of our mandate."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Yes, it’s hard to say, because there’s so many other variables."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"How, specifically, will you take that into account?"
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,JEAN YUNG.
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,STEVE MATTHEWS.
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"In any case, the Fedwire® did go down for a few hours, in the three- or four-hour range."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, you know, we learn from these instances."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks very much.
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,SAM FLEMING.
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"But to go back to your question, if we did see a persistent—inflation running persistently below, then that is something the Committee would be concerned about and something that we would take into account in setting policy."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Indeed, the Dallas trimmed mean is at 2 percent."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"In addition, the trimmed mean measures of inflation did not go down as much."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I’d point to things like portfolio management, service prices, apparel prices, and other things."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"And in this case, as we look at these readings in the first quarter for core, we do see good reasons to think that some or all of the unexpected decrease may wind up being transient."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"So “persistent” carries the sense of something that’s not transient, something that will sustain over a period of time."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,So we say in our Statement of Longer- Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy that the Committee would be concerned if inflation were running persistently above or below 2 percent.
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"As you point out, both headline and core, though, did come in on the soft side in the first quarter, and that was not expected as it relates to core."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,I would point out that inflation actually ran—including core inflation—actually ran pretty close to 2 percent for much of 2018.
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"As I mentioned, we think our policy stance is appropriate at the moment, and we don’t see a strong case for moving in either direction."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, first, we are strongly committed to our 2 percent inflation objective and to achieving it on a sustained and symmetric basis."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,At what level would it require a policy response from the Committee?
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Chair, I guess I wonder, is it time to address low inflation through policy, and can you give us some sense of your metric for when it would be time?"
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Mr.
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"As the statement noted, core inflation is now running below 2 percent—it’s been falling for three straight months, and while you’ve been close, it’s only been at 2 percent or above one month since 2012."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Steve Liesman, CNBC."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Chair.
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you, Mr."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Sam Fleming from the Financial Times.
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,STEVE LIESMAN.
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Let me carry on on the same theme.
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Do you think markets have effectively gotten ahead of themselves on this?
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, again, this is just a technical fix."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we think it’s important, and we have the tools to do that, so we’ve used them again today."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"That’s just good monetary policy, good monetary control."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,But we do think it’s important that we be able to control the federal funds rate and generally keep it within the range.
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"So a small, temporary deviation outside of the range would really carry no—wouldn’t be important, as your question suggests."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,And I do have a follow-up.
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Is there any feed-through to broader credit conditions and financial conditions that you worry about, or is it simply a matter of the Fed showing that it can control what it says it’s controlling?"
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Shifting gears a little bit, I wondered if you could flesh out—I know you’re describing it as a small technical adjustment, but on the IOER federal funds spread, give us a sense of why it matters whether or not this breaches the upper limit a little bit."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Howard Schneider with Reuters.
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Hi.
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,HOWARD SCHNEIDER.
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,And I would just say that we’re comfortable—the Committee is comfortable with our current policy stance.
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,But that’s all we do.
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"So— we do, of course, though—as a routine matter, as you well know—we look not only at our baseline, but we also look at alternative simulations, both better and worse, and we ask ourselves what the appropriate policy response would be."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,We don’t see a strong case for moving in either direction.
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"So as I mentioned, we’ve just come through a two-day meeting, and we’ve done a deep dive on economic and financial conditions in the United States and around the world and thought about our policy, and we do think our policy stance is appropriate right now."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks.
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"The discussion, for example, about the 1995 example—do you actually need to see a looming recession to cut rates, or could an insurance cut be appropriate?"
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,And what sort of economic conditions would you need to see to give serious consideration of a rate cut?
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,There’s obviously been a lot of speculation in the markets about the prospects for a rate reduction this year.
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,I will be glad to take your questions.
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you very much.
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"The target range for the federal funds rate is our main indicator of the stance of policy, and it remains unchanged."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,We suspect that some transitory factors may be at work.
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Core inflation unexpectedly fell as well, however, and as of March stood at 1.6 percent for the previous 12 months."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Overall inflation for the 12 months ended in March was 1.5 percent.
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"As expected, overall inflation fell at the start of this year as earlier oil price declines worked through the system."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Overall inflation fluctuated from a few tenths above 2 percent to a few tenths below over this period, with the moves mostly due to changes in energy prices."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"From March through December, core inflation—which excludes volatile food and energy components—was at or very close to 2 percent."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"But last year, with the unemployment rate at or below 4 percent, inflation moved up."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"For much of this long expansion, inflation ran a bit below our 2 percent objective, alongside considerable slack in resource utilization."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,The Committee is strongly committed to our symmetric 2 percent inflation objective.
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Recent data suggest that these two components will bounce back, supporting our expectation of healthy GDP growth over the rest of the year."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Although first-quarter GDP rose more than most forecasters had expected, growth in private consumption and business fixed investment slowed."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Job gains rebounded in March after a weak reading in February and averaged 180,000 per month in the first quarter, well above the pace needed to absorb new entrants to the labor force."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"The Committee also believes that solid underlying fundamentals are supporting the economy, including accommodative financial conditions, high employment and job growth, rising wages, and strong consumer and business sentiment."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Overall, the economy continues on a healthy path, and the Committee believes that the current stance of policy is appropriate."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Economic growth and job creation have both been a bit stronger than we anticipated, while inflation has been somewhat weaker."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Incoming data since our last meeting in March have been broadly in line with our expectations.
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,My colleagues and I have one overarching goal: to use our monetary policy tools to sustain the economic expansion with a strong job market and stable prices for the benefit of the American people.
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"At the FOMC meeting that concluded today, we reviewed economic and financial developments in the United States and around the world and decided to leave our policy interest rate unchanged."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Good afternoon, and welcome."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Transcript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference May 1, 2019 CHAIR POWELL."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"They’re fairly rare, but we learn from them, and in this case it was internal, and it’s been corrected."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thus, our baseline view remains that, with a strong job market and continued growth, inflation will return to 2 percent over time and then be roughly symmetric around our longer-term objective."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"At the start of the year, a number of crosscurrents presented risks to the outlook, including weak global growth, particularly in China and Europe; the possibility of a disruptive Brexit; and uncertainty around unresolved trade negotiations."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"While concerns remain in all of these areas, it appears that risks have moderated somewhat."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Global financial conditions have eased, supported in many places around the world by an accommodative shift in monetary policy and, in some cases, fiscal policy."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,These actions helped keep the effective federal funds rate well within the target range.
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Last year we twice lowered the IOER rate by 5 basis points relative to the top of the target range after the federal funds rate moved toward the top of the range.
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"As balance sheet normalization continues, we have expected that the effective federal funds rate would shift up over time relative to the IOER rate."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,We use the IOER rate to help keep the federal funds rate in our target range.
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,The change does not reflect any shift in the intended stance of monetary policy.
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Finally, we made a small technical adjustment in one of our tools for implementing monetary policy: the interest rate on excess reserves, or IOER rate."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"As we have often emphasized, adjustments to the balance sheet normalization process may well be needed as the process unfolds."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"There is no pressing need to resolve this matter, however, and any decisions we ultimately reach will be implemented with considerable advance notice and in a manner that allows for smooth adjustment."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Today’s preliminary discussion laid the groundwork for more complete analysis and discussion, and we plan to return to the maturity composition question toward the end of the year."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,This choice raises many complex issues and has possible implications for the stance of policy.
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,It really has no implications for policy.
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"As part of normalization, we will have to decide what the maturity structure should be in the longer term."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"In the wake of the crisis, the Fed bought a large amount of longer-term securities with the aim of lowering longer-term interest rates and, thus, supporting the recovery."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Before the financial crisis, our portfolio was weighted toward shorter-term debt of the federal government."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Today we had a preliminary discussion about the longer-run maturity composition of the portfolio.
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,These plans support our longer-run dual-mandate objectives and also provide clarity about the path of our asset holdings.
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"In March, we decided to slow the pace of balance sheet runoff, starting this month, and to cease runoff entirely in September."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"In January, we decided to continue implementing monetary policy using our current policy regime, which involves providing an ample supply of reserves."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Over the past several months, we have made a number of consequential decisions about our balance sheet."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"The Committee views these developments, along with the outlook for continued growth, a strong job market, and muted inflation pressures, as consistent with continued patience in assessing further adjustments in monetary policy."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Further, there are reports of progress in the trade talks between the United States and China."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Recent data from China and Europe show some improvement, and the prospect of a disorderly Brexit has been pushed off for now."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Because of these purchases, our portfolio is now weighted toward longer-term securities."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,HOWARD SCHNEIDER.
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,And today we made one more such change.
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I guess the question is, at what point would these steady declines in the IOER—steady widening of this spread, if it continues, essentially become the policy choice?"
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,DONNA BORAK.
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"And if it isn’t and if it runs persistently below 2 percent for a sustained period, then that’s something we’d take into account in setting policy."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, again, we do expect that this reading will be transient and inflation will move back up."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"And so we take all those things into account, and the part of it that we can control is the slack part."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s nothing like it was in the 1960s when the Phillips curve was quite steep, so that’s also something that plays a role."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s actually still a measurable role.
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,So we also think that slack—the level of slack in the economy does play some small role.
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"So probably the biggest single factor driving it is the rate of underlying inflation or the closely related idea of where inflation expectations are anchored—the thought being, that’s where inflation will go in the long run if it’s not been pushed by those other factors."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,There will always be factors hitting it.
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Inflation, first of all—month-to-month, quarter-to-quarter—is going to move around."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, I guess, how do you think about inflation as that fiscal benefit wanes toward the end of this year?"
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"And you still have that to some extent, although the tax cuts have mostly feeded through—we’ve still got something in the pipeline from the spending cap increases."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"So as you just mentioned, last year when you guys were kind of getting inflation coming in around 2 percent, you had this benefit of the tailwind of fiscal stimulus."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Jeanna Smialek, New York Times."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,JEANNA SMIALEK.
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Because if it doesn’t, you run the risk that inflation expectations can—it has been the case, most of the misses are on the downside—inflation expectations over time could be pulled down, and that could put downward pressure on inflation and make it harder for us to react to downturns and harder for us to, you know, support the economy in difficult times."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,I do think it’s important that inflation run close to and sustainably —for a sustained period of time—and symmetrically around 2 percent.
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"If inflation were to run persistently below 2 percent or persistently above 2 percent, that would be a concern for the Committee, and the Committee would take that into account in making policy."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Yes, I mean—so, as I said earlier, we do address this in our, sort of, constitutional document."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Chairman Powell, Donna Borak with CNN."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, if not, are you worried that there is unwanted tightening from real rates, being where they are?"
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Do you think the relative increase in women’s wages is a problem for the U.S. economy?
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, I think, generally, I’d have to see the data on that."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"We were able to quickly identify the problem: It was an internal problem, and we were able to correct it and make changes so that that problem and other problems like it cannot repeat themselves."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"But as a follow-up on this, it is demonstrating that you can control the market you want to control."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"I want to say it was April 1, but it may have been April 2."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,So that’s right.
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Sure.
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I was just wondering if you could talk about what happened there, how long it lasted, whether you know what happened, whether you’re still looking into it, and whether it’s something that could happen again."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"I wanted to ask—early last month, I believe it was April 2, the Fedwire® system went down."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Victoria Guida with Politico.
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,VICTORIA GUIDA.
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks.
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"I haven’t seen this research either, so I don’t really—really know."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s really not my role to engage with potential nominees to the Fed, so I’m really not going to go there."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I think we’re getting in here to commenting on a nominee to the Fed indirectly, and that’s something I’d rather avoid."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"But if the data shows that women’s wages are rising higher, is there a damage to the U.S. economy if male’s wages are declining or not growing as fast as women’s?"
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Just to push a little bit on this.
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,So— DONNA BORAK.
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, I think men and women should make the same for the same work, by and large."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Over time, I really wonder whether that’s the case."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,It sounds like you picked a particular time frame.
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Well, I mean, if it was an issue, would it be appropriate to lower rates if core inflation held closer to 1½ percent?"
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Pivoting a little bit— about wages, since 2010, women’s real earnings have gone up about 3.9 percent compared to men’s, which have risen about 2.1."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Sorry.
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"And as for asset prices, some asset prices are somewhat elevated, but I would say not extremely so."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"But the four things we look at are, first, asset prices."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, in addition, I would say that the financial system is quite resilient to shocks of various kinds with high capital and liquidity."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"So there are four aspects of it that I’ll go through quickly, but I’d say that the headline really is that while there are some concerns around nonfinancial corporate debt, really the finding is that, overall, financial stability vulnerabilities are moderate, on balance."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,And that enables us to focus our assessments regularly on the same things so that we can be held accountable and be transparent.
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"First, we’ve developed and published our framework for assessing financial stability vulnerabilities—put it out for comment and welcome any feedback that we get from the public."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I think there haven’t been a lot of changes since the last meeting, but I’ll just go through the way we think about it."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we had our quarterly briefing today—yesterday, as a matter of fact—and had that discussion as well."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Any consensus on whether such risks are growing as the markets hit new highs, and we do see some instability in short-end trading—is it possible that rates are too low at this point?"
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Leverage in the financial sector—I mentioned households are actually in good shape from a leverage standpoint.
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Was there a broader discussion at this meeting?
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,I’m curious about the financial conditions that you see out there.
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Michael McKee with Bloomberg.
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHAEL MCKEE.
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I think we’ll continue to control it, and it will continue to transmit well into broader financial conditions."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I think the Fed controlling the federal funds rate is actually important from that standpoint, and I don’t see us not controlling it."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"And that’s important, because it’s really broader financial conditions that matter, not so much precisely the federal funds rate."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,And the transmission of the federal funds rate into other short-term rates—money market rates—has been very good over a long period of time.
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,NICK TIMIRAOS.
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Yes, I mean—so, generally speaking, the federal funds rate—we control only directly the federal funds rate in terms of the market rate."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,The minutes of the March meeting tell us “a few” officials worried about financial stability risks.
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Default rates are low.
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,We actually have a financial stability briefing and opportunity for comment every other meeting.
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Borrowing is relatively low.
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Now, the second part of your question?"
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"It appears to be more—we don’t know this, but you never know until—with hindsight, with perfect hindsight, but some of it does appear to be transient or idiosyncratic."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"The weak first quarter performance was not expected—of core was not expected, and I don’t think is related to anything we did, in terms of raising rates."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,And so I think the expectation was that inflation would remain up around 2 percent.
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,The fiscal changes were hitting the economy in a very positive way.
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,And the economy was quite strong and was growing strong.
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, to your first question, if you go back and think about the middle of last year, inflation was at 2 percent and appeared to be staying there."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, if not, do you worry about any unwelcome tightening in real rates, given the recent softness in core inflation?"
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, if so, would it be appropriate to lower rates if core inflation remained persistently closer to 1½ percent instead of 2 percent?"
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Chair Powell, with the benefit of hindsight, did last year’s rate increases make it harder for the Fed to credibly affirm its 2 percent symmetric inflation target is not, in fact, a ceiling?"
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal.
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Those are better first-order tools to deal with these kinds of issues than monetary policy.
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"I would say that, though, that really the tools for addressing those concerns are better—capital liquidity, good supervision, good stress testing, and things like that."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,So we do say that risks to the financial system—we say in our longer-run statement of goals and monetary policy strategy that risks to the financial system that could prevent us from achieving our goals are something that we do take into consideration.
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,If I could follow up on that—I’m just curious as to whether the level of asset prices is a reason why you might not be interested in cutting rates.
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHAEL MCKEE.
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, on balance, in my view, vulnerabilities are moderate."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,NICK TIMIRAOS.
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"And then the last two—the last two things are really about the leverage in the financial system and funding risk, and those are both very, very low by historic standards in the United States."
2019-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Nonfinancial corporates is an area that we’ve spotlighted and focused on for attention, and there are concerns about that—not so much from a financial stability standpoint, but from the standpoint that having a highly levered corporate sector could be an amplifier for a downturn."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, I don’t—I don’t discuss elected officials publicly or privately, really."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, we don’t—we react to anything in principle that could undermine our achievement of our dual-mandate goals—maximum employment, stable prices—is worthy of our attention and can call forth a policy response."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,And that’s just how we look at it.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,VICTORIA GUIDA.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Victoria Guida with Politico."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"And also, do you think that you and the President have the same goals when it comes to monetary policy?"
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I was wondering, is there a point at which you think that, publicly or privately, you should push back on the President’s criticisms rather than ignoring him?"
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we take the—you know, we take the crosscurrents as a given, and we have our tools."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"You’ve said that the Fed doesn’t take short-term political considerations into account, and you’ve defended the Fed’s independence."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"Well, we have the tools we have, and we’re committed and sworn to use them to support economic activity."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHAEL MCKEE.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I just would say, that’s why we think—it’s one of the reasons why we think it’s so important to sustain the expansion, keep it going, because we really are benefiting groups that haven’t seen, you know, this kind of prosperity in a long time."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"You’re 10 years deep into this, and that’s something we heard quite a lot at the conference in Chicago on the review."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,Can you identify any sectors that would benefit from a lower cost of capital?
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"The reason why we say “sustain the expansion” is, you’re seeing now, for the first time, you know, communities that are being brought into the benefits of this expansion that hadn’t been earlier."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"And so we will use those tools and use them as we see as appropriate to achieve our objectives, which really are to sustain this expansion, and I would just make a note of that."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,But we do generally believe that—that our interest rate policy can support demand and support business investment as well.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,And they do support economic activity through a number of channels that are reasonably well understood—some more directly tied to interest rates than others.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,Or is this really about the Fed being the only game in town?
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I would just say that we are—at the Fed, we’re deeply committed to carrying out our mission, and also that our independence from direct political control we see as an important institutional feature that has served both the economy and the country well."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"But given your description of the crosscurrents, do you think Fed policy can solve those problems?"
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you, Chairman Powell."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"Chair Powell, are you concerned that new digital currencies like Libra, which Facebook unveiled this week, could undermine the Fed and erode your power to influence the economy?"
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"And something interesting, I think, is developing, is that outside experts are excited and are—like the idea of the Fed shifting your inflation target up to 4 percent—around there, roughly, I guess."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,Have you modeled the additional growth and inflation you might get from a rate cut?
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,I want to take you back to Chicago and the review of your monetary policy strategy.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,Greg Robb from MarketWatch.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,GREG ROBB.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, I would say that, you know, through international forums, you know, we have significant input into the payment system and, as you know, play an important role in the payment system here in the United States."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,They play into our world through consumer protection and money laundering and things like that.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, we have—we don’t have plenary authority over cryptocurrencies as such."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,Do you think the Fed will be involved in regulating Libra then?
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I would echo what Governor Carney said, which is that we will wind up having quite high expectations, from a sort of safety and soundness and regulatory standpoint, if they do decide to go forward with something."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"There are also potential risks, particularly of a currency that could, you know, that could potentially have large application."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, there are potential benefits here."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"We meet with a broad range of private-sector firms all the time on financial technology, and there’s just a tremendous amount of innovation going on out there."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we’re—you know, it’s something we’re looking at."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, Facebook, I believe, has made quite broad rounds in—around the world really with regulators, supervisors, and lots of people to discuss their plans, and that certainly includes us."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, essentially, not too concerned about, you know, the central banks no longer being able to carry out monetary policy because of cryptocurrencies or digital currencies."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,Digital currencies are in their infancy.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, of course, the—so I think we’re a long way from that."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, on your specific question of digital currencies replacing central bank currencies, I think we’re a long way from that."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,And did anyone from Facebook talk with anyone at the Fed before Libra was unveiled this week?
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,Nancy Marshall-Genzer with Marketplace.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"If consumer spending is solid and business investment has been slowed by uncertainty, I’d like to get your thinking on what a Fed rate cut would do?"
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHAEL MCKEE.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,Why didn’t you do that?
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"And then, specifically, what data are you looking at that you decided not to have a rate cut?"
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"On the other hand, manufacturing numbers were a little bit weaker, you have growth in jobs but coming in a little weaker, and then you have low inflation."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,Consumer spending is strong.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, on one hand, you have strong overall growth."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,How do you reconcile the conflicting economic data coming in?
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,Edward Lawrence from Fox Business Network.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you for doing this, Chairman."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,Yes.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,EDWARD LAWRENCE.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we will act as needed, including promptly, if that’s appropriate, and use our tools to expand—to sustain the expansion."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"Ultimately, the question we’re going to be asking ourselves is, are these risks going to be continuing to weigh on the outlook?"
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we felt that it would be better to get a clearer picture of things, and that we would, in fact, learn a lot about these developments in the near term."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"First, it’s just the fact that some of these developments are so recent that we want to see whether they’ll sustain."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,And I gave a couple of reasons why that is the case.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"But all of those, but apparently one, felt that it would be better to see more to—before moving."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, I would say, there was not much support for cutting rates now at this meeting."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, why not now?"
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,Why not just cut them now?
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"If the most—according to the dot plot, I mean—if the most likely case is that you will have to cut rates in the next 18 months and given some of the concerns about, you know, policy needing to react sooner and more aggressively, what would have been the downsides to cutting rates now?"
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,Paul Kiernan from Dow Jones.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you, Chairman Powell."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"They think that that would, you know, help monetary policy, and that there’s no—2 percent is not, like, sanctimonious or anything, or whatever, sacred."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,[0:24:15.5] CHAIR POWELL.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"Michael McKee, Bloomberg Television and Radio."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"Well, you gave a pretty good picture."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"But I would say, the big pieces of it are this: The baseline outlook has been a good one, and that has basically been consumer spending coming back up in the second quarter."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I think what that picture—what we took away from that picture is that we’d like to see more, that we do see these risks, and what we want to do is, we want to watch and see whether they continue to weigh upon the outlook."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,If you lay the crosscurrents on top of that—concerns about global growth and trade developments—you have the full picture.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,Then you see the crosscurrents.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"But you do see growth in services, so you—this pattern around the world of weak manufacturing but growth in the far larger part of the services economy, which has led to low unemployment, good job creation, rising wages, that’s kind of the two big pieces of it that you see."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,But it’s something that we’re watching.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,There isn’t any one thing that explains it all.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"So there are many, many things."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"So there—lower oil prices are contributing to lower investment, although they’re also leading to lower gas prices, which supports spending."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,The Boeing 737 issues may be contributing in their own way.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,Some of it may be uncertainty over your supply chains due to trade developments.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s not solely a domestic issue, and it may be that there are a range of factors that are contributing to that, including, for example, what China has done over the last couple of years in working to bring down its leverage."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"Manufacturing, investment, and trade have been weaker."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"You mentioned manufacturing, and we’re seeing this all around the world."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,So that part of the economy is solid.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"Job creation, if you take a three-month average, is still well above, you know, the entry—level of entry into the workforce."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, all of that, underlying fundamentals for the consumer spending part of the economy, which is 70 percent of the economy, is quite solid."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,You’ve got high levels of household confidence.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,You’ve got wages going up.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,You’ve got workers in surveys saying that jobs are plentiful.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,You’ve got companies in surveys saying that labor is scarce.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,You’ve got a tight labor market.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"And consumer spending is at a healthy level, and that makes sense."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,That is coming true.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mean, it’s a complicated picture, and, you know, the answer is, we look at all of it."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,It seems that you’ve taken that off the table.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Jean Yung with Market News."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,Have you taken it off the table?
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,BRIAN CHEUNG.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, I gave a whole speech about this a few weeks ago, so."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,And we continue to take all these risks seriously.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,And we’re very carefully assessing that.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"And really the question is, how concerned should we be about large holdings by market-based vehicles that I mentioned, and what risks do they present?"
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"I’m not saying it’s perfect, but I think we do understand what risks the banks are running."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"But my sense is, though, that that’s really not the problem."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I don’t, I don’t—you know, I no longer am day-to-day involved in this as I was before I took this job."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s in—it’s out in those market-based vehicles.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,The issue is that the risk isn’t in the banks.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, I think the issue isn’t that the banks don’t understand what the rules are."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"Or is it just going to remain kind of, like, bilateral kind of conversations with banks?"
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,Is anything else coming?
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"Is there any intention, is there any plan on the part of the Fed or other regulators to sort of create any additional clarity for, or—and consistency, really—that’s the other point of guidance, right?—is to make sure everyone knows kind of what the supervisory expectations are for leveraged lending and for all—for anything, for that matter."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,JOHN HELTMAN.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, we call it out as a macroeconomic risk, but it’s not really a financial stability risk, in the sense that it could undermine the ability of the financial system to do its job of intermediating credit."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, this is something that we take very seriously and that the FSOC, the Financial Stability Oversight Council, is looking at."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"And they’re actually pretty stably funded, in the sense that there’s no run risk, but there’s still macroeconomic risk."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we— you know, we monitor those vehicles to see what they are."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think, internationally, not as much, and the Financial Stability Board is actually looking more carefully at that."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"And so we now have—you know, we have a good sense of, domestically, of where that paper is."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"What’s happened, though, is, the paper is now owned by market-based vehicles: collateralized loan obligations, mutual funds, and things like that."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,Hi.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"We will keep—you know, keep monitoring that carefully."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,Brian Cheung with Yahoo Finance.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"So the statement noted that the labor market still remains strong, but the May jobs report that that we saw missed on estimates, but employment rates still stayed at 3.6 percent."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,PAUL KIERNAN.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you very much.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"I would say this: If we do provide more accommodation—again, we haven’t really addressed this—but if we do provide more accommodation, we’ll certainly keep in mind what we said earlier this year, which is that we’ll always be willing to adjust balance sheet policy so that it serves our dual-mandate objectives."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,Balance sheet runoff is very close to the end of its planned life.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, of course, we haven’t made any decisions yet."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,And would the Committee be inclined to do something like that if it lowers rates before September?
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"I wanted to ask—did the FOMC discuss a change to its balance sheet policy at this meeting, perhaps ending runoffs earlier than planned?"
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,JEAN YUNG.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, it—the surveys that I mentioned will all show that the labor market has tightened, but not overtightened."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,You have seen a tightening labor market.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,You haven’t seen real signals that we’re at maximum employment.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, we’ve all lived through—you know, when I got to the Fed, we were in the 8 percent–plus range, and it’s just gone down and down and down, and you haven’t seen wages picked up."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, you know, we watch—we watch all of this very carefully, and I think we’re very careful about not assuming that we’re, you know, that would—that there’s no more slack in the labor market."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"So what’s, I guess, a little surprising, though, is that you could reach these levels of unemployment late—you know, long into a cycle, let’s say, and not see even higher wages that are pushing up on inflation, because wages at this level, even though they’re growing at a healthy rate, at an appropriate rate, they’re not growing at a rate that would provide much upward thrust for inflation."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"So the level of wages is very consistent with what it should be, in the sense that it’s approximately equal to inflation plus productivity increases on an hourly basis."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,You mentioned wages.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, by just lots and lots of numbers, the labor market is in a good place."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,The unemployment rate is lower.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, we have to be closer, because more jobs are being created than people are entering the labor force."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"What does that tell you about employment, and by all standards compared to, say, a month ago or a year ago, are we closer or farther away from full employment or maximum employment?"
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,I’m wondering how you reconcile that with the fact that we only got 3.1 percent year-over-year wage growth in that report.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,I’m just wondering if you could expand a little bit on the labor market.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, in that, I feel—I feel like that is—that’s in a good place, but we never—we never say “Mission accomplished” on that."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"So that’s where it starts for us in supervision, is the risks that the banks are running—you know, running on their own books and to themselves and to each other."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"We impose very large losses on those portfolios, so we kind of have a sense of what that is, whereas before the crisis, there was a lot of lack of knowledge about what the losses would be."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mean, there was some thought at the beginning that we should—some people recommended that we just talk to, you know, econ Ph.D.’s about this, but, no, that’s not what we chose to do, and we’re glad this is the choice we made."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I think everybody thought, you know, that’s—that was really quite worth doing."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"And that is, I think, you know, for someone who does this work, that was very focusing and motivating, too."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"And just now, you have, you know, companies who want to hire and are bringing people into the—providing opportunities for people to come into the labor force to an extent not seen in quite a long time."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"What they have had is low unemployment, lots of social problems."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"They haven’t had, just, a booming economy."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, the idea being, they haven’t had, you know, a bull market in these communities."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"And they were—there, I think, people were quite struck by their intervention, which was really uniformly around how important maximum employment is and what it means in their communities."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"But I’ll just say, again, that the heart of the conference was the two panels on—with practitioners in low and moderate income—who live in low- and moderate-income communities and are part of those communities."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’ve had a series of Fed Listens around the country at every Reserve Bank, and we had an academic conference earlier this month, with seven papers written and criticized, and leading global experts."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"And it’s meant to be a way to open ourselves up, to let the sunshine in, and have dialogue and criticism with the constituencies that we serve."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’ll be a yearlong, or even longer, process, looking at our strategy, tools, and communications."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s something that—I thought it was both appropriate and important for us to do.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,So it’s a new thing for us.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"This gives me a chance to say a couple things about the review and Chicago, in particular."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"And so we’re actually taking a less—we’re looking at less radical ideas, such as how to make the 2 percent inflation objective more credible."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,Our statutory mandate is price stability.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"And the reason is, it’s become a global norm, 2 percent."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,We did say that.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,We have—we’ve said that we wouldn’t look at raising the target rate for inflation.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"And then, if so, why, or—and what’s your thoughts on that?"
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,GREG ROBB.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"But even those two panels that you just referenced, the people that spoke, they—when they were asked about, you know, 2 percent inflation or higher inflation, they kind of shrugged their shoulders, you know?"
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,So—is 4 percent inflation radical?
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,And to who?
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, by the way, we test that regularly in the stress tests."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,And so we monitor that very carefully—so do the banks—and you see exposures that are much smaller than they were before the crisis.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, this—the first thing you start with as a bank supervisor is the risks that the banks are taking to themselves through their portfolio, through the risks that they’re running and the pipeline—you know, the obligations that they’ve undertaken to underwrite deals."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, we have the authority we need to examine the banks for safety and soundness exposure."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,But that’s really the beginning of this—of the story.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"So the 2013 guidance is not binding, and that’s what came out of the GAO review."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,Or is the plan to just kind of carry on with supervision as you’re—as you are?
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"And does the Fed have any intent—intention to either issue, like, a leveraged lending rule or a new guidance that is less problematic?"
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"I want to know what the—is the 2013 guidance still representative of the, sort of, Fed’s thinking about leveraged lending?"
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"You yourself have said that credit underwriting quality seems to be deteriorating somewhat lately, and that the Fed has tools to supervise banks and to prevent leveraged lending from becoming too much of an issue."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,So I was wondering if you could discuss that.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,But yet leveraged lending is a source of concern.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"I have a question about the Fed’s—or, I guess, the bank regulators’ leveraged lending guidance from 2013."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,John Heltman with American Banker.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,JOHN HELTMAN.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,So saying that you’re going to go for 4 percent—I wonder how credible that will be.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"So—but it’s quite challenging to get inflation— it’s been—even with very high levels of resource utilization, inflation has been lingering and not getting back up to target in a sustained, symmetric kind of a way."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’ve done better than other large central banks that are not, you know, open economies, like the U.K., where you have big currency moves that move inflation around."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,You see central banks having a hard time getting inflation up to their—close to their objective.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,I think you see disinflationary pressures around the world.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,And I’ll tell you why.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,I don’t think it’s—I don’t think it’s a practical alternative.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"As you know, the GAO had a letter saying that they thought it was a rule, and it sort of went away."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,So I’m not the right person to ask about that sort of dollar policy intervention.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"There was, as you see, a number of people wrote down rate cuts."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s just something that we don’t do.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,I think we’ll learn a great deal more about them.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,I expect a full range of data and information on all of these issues that we are looking at.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,I’m sure that things will change before the next meeting.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,Do you think something could change before the next meeting?
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,NICK TIMIRAOS.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,And that’s our focus.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,And so we do expect that we’ll be learning a lot more on all of these issues in the near term.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,And I also mentioned that some of these—some of these developments have been of quite recent vintage.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"But the Committee wanted to see more, as I mentioned."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,A number of others see that the case has strengthened.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,Eight actually wrote down rate cuts.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, generally, as I mentioned, many on the Committee do see a strengthened case—eight of those, a strengthened case for cutting rates."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"Particularly, we’d like to see whether these risks continue to weigh on the outlook."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I came to the view that I expressed to you, which is that we’re going to be monitoring—monitoring the crosscurrents and the other items that we’ve mentioned, but that we’d like to see more going forward."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"So the Committee had, you know, our usual long discussion of global and domestic economic and financial conditions and then spent this morning talking about monetary policy."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"And is the Committee considering moving, given all the uncertainty you addressed, moving its— changing its policy before the next meeting?"
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"Specifically, was it one of the options—the policy options in the Tealbook?"
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"Chair Powell, did you consider a rate cut today?"
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"Nick Timiraos, Wall Street Journal."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,NICK TIMIRAOS.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,I will be pleased to take your questions.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,And I think that’s—we think that that’s the right way to move here.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"Again, many of these developments happened, you know, part of the way through the last intermeeting period."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we want to see—we want to see and we want to react to developments and trends that are sustained, that are genuine, and not react just to data points or just to changes in sentiment, which can be volatile."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,Could you clarify what you would do if the President tweets or calls you to say he would like to demote you as Fed Chair?
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Heather Long from the Washington Post."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,HEATHER LONG.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"And then, in the end, we’ll use our tools as appropriate to sustain this long expansion."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,And we’ll be asking the question whether those risks are going to continue to weigh on the outlook.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"We expect to learn a good deal more, as I mentioned."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,So we’ll be monitoring the implications of all of those developments for the U.S. economic outlook.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"We like to average over three or six months, but still that bears watching."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"We do see, though, some areas that we’re looking at, such as, I mentioned, business fixed income.2 So—also, the prolonged shortfall in inflation and perhaps job growth—we don’t like to look at one job report."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"In the meantime, we have incoming data in the United States that’s been pretty good, particularly for the consumer: Consumer spending is solid supported by, you know, a healthy job market, high levels of employment, wages going up."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,Risks seem to have grown.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,So we’re not exclusively focused on one event or one piece of data.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s really trade developments and concerns about global growth that are on our minds.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,But we’re also looking at global growth.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,I guess I would start by agreeing with your premise that news about trade has been an important driver of sentiment in the intermeeting period.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"Yeah, so I would say that we’re not looking at any one thing."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"If, for example, there’s a deal with China, does that take the possibility of rate cuts off the table?"
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"It was really the threat of tariffs against Mexico that caused at least the market to become definitively banking, or—pricing in rate cuts."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,Could you walk us through your thinking about trade?
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"Mr. Chairman, Steve Liesman, CNBC."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,STEVE LIESMAN.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"At the same time, we are—we’re quite mindful of the risks to the outlook and are prepared to move and use our tools as needed to sustain the expansion."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"Only seven weeks ago, we had a great jobs report and came out of the last FOMC meeting feeling that the economy, and our policy, was in a good place."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thus, my colleagues and I will be looking to see whether these uncertainties will continue to weigh on the outlook, and we will use our tools as appropriate to sustain the expansion."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,Doing so would risk adding even more uncertainty to the outlook.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"It is important, however, that monetary policy not overreact to any individual data point or short- term swing in sentiment."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,Participants see unemployment remaining low this year and next.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"Let me explain the basis for this judgment, starting with the outlook for jobs and growth."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,Many FOMC participants now see that the case for a somewhat more accommodative policy has strengthened.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"While the baseline outlook remains favorable, the question is whether these uncertainties will continue to weigh on the outlook and thus call for additional monetary policy accommodation."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"Against this backdrop, inflation remains muted."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,Risk sentiment in financial markets has deteriorated as well.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,These concerns may have contributed to the drop in business confidence in some recent surveys and may be starting to show through to incoming data.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"Apparent progress on trade turned to greater uncertainty, and our contacts in business and agriculture report heightened concerns over trade developments."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"Growth indicators from around the world have disappointed, on net, raising concerns about the strength of the global economy."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"In the weeks since our last meeting, the crosscurrents have reemerged."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"Our continued patient stance seemed appropriate, and the Committee saw no strong case for adjusting our policy rate."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"The latest data from China and Europe were encouraging, and there were reports of progress in trade negotiations with China."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"At the time of our last FOMC meeting, which ended on May 1, there was tentative evidence that these crosscurrents were moderating."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"Along with this favorable picture, we have been mindful of some ongoing crosscurrents, including trade developments and concerns about global growth."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"Inflation has been running somewhat below our objective, but we have expected it to pick up, supported by solid growth and a strong job market."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"So far this year, the economy has performed reasonably well, with solid fundamentals supporting continued growth and strong employment."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,I’d like to step back and review how the changing economic and financial picture brings us to today’s decision.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"In light of increased uncertainties and muted inflation pressures, we now emphasize that the Committee will closely monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook and will act as appropriate to sustain the expansion with a strong labor market and inflation near its 2 percent objective."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"Since the beginning of the year, we have judged that our current policy stance was broadly appropriate and that we should be patient in assessing the need for any changes."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"At the FOMC meeting that concluded today, we maintained our policy interest rate but made some significant changes to our statement."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"My colleagues and I have one overarching goal: to sustain the economic expansion, with a strong job market and stable prices, for the benefit of the American people."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"Good afternoon, and welcome."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"Transcript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference June 19, 2019 CHAIR POWELL."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"Monthly job gains in May were lower than expected, however, and, in light of recent developments, this bears watching."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"Still, many labor market indicators remain strong."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"Community, business, and labor leaders all tell us that the prospects for job seekers have seldom been better, and that this is true even for those who have traditionally struggled to find work."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"Wages are rising, and this is particularly so for lower-paying jobs."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,Uncertainties surrounding the baseline outlook have clearly risen since our last meeting.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"Though some participants wrote down policy cuts and others did not, our deliberations made clear that a number of those who wrote down a flat rate path agree that the case for additional accommodation has strengthened since our May meeting."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,The projections of appropriate policy show that many participants believe that some cut in the federal funds rate will be appropriate in the scenario that they see as most likely.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"Overall, our policy discussions focused on the appropriate response to the uncertain environment."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"factors with the risks to growth already noted, participants expressed concerns about a more sustained shortfall of inflation."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,Combining these 1 Chair Powell intended to say that growth in business fixed investment slowed in the second quarter.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"Market-based measures of inflation compensation have moved down since our May meeting, and some survey- based expectations measures are near the bottom of their historic ranges."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"Because there are no definitive measures of inflation expectations, we must rely on imperfect proxies."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"We are firmly committed to our symmetric 2 percent inflation objective, and we are well aware that inflation weakness that persists even in a healthy economy could precipitate a difficult-to-arrest downward drift in longer-run inflation expectations."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"Moreover, weaker global growth may continue to hold inflation down around the world."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"Wages are rising, as noted above, but not at a pace that would provide much upward impetus to inflation."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"Setting aside short-term fluctuations, Committee participants expressed concerns about the pace of inflation’s return to 2 percent."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"Participants broadly see inflation moving back up toward our 2 percent objective, but at a slower pace than had been expected."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,Data since then show some pickup.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"After running close to our symmetric 2 percent objective for most of last year, inflation declined in the first quarter."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thus, while the baseline outlook remains favorable, many FOMC participants cited the investment picture and weaker business sentiment and the crosscurrents I mentioned earlier as supporting their judgment that the risk of less favorable outcomes has risen."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"In contrast, the limited evidence available at this time suggests that growth in business fixed income has slowed in the second quarter.1 Moreover, manufacturing production has posted declines so far this year."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"While consumption was weak in the first quarter, incoming data show that it has bounced back and is now running at a solid pace."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,The more reliable drivers of growth in the economy are spending on consumption and business investment.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"As I noted then, the unexpected strength was largely in net exports and inventories—components that are not generally reliable indicators of ongoing momentum."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"Annual growth will be boosted by the surprisingly strong first quarter, which had just been reported at the time of the May FOMC meeting."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,The growth projections for the year as a whole mask some important details about the composition of growth.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"Committee participants’ growth projections from 2019 are little revised from March, with a central tendency of 2 percent to 2.2 percent, just above their estimates of longer-run normal growth."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"The central tendency for 2019 core inflation, which omits volatile food and energy components, is between 1.7 and 1.8 percent."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think the law is clear that I have a four-year term, and I fully intend to serve it."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,This added accommodation would support economic activity and inflation’s return to our objective.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Chair Powell."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I just would say that, if you pay too close attention to the dots, then you may lose sight of the larger picture."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,The dot is either one thing or it’s another.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,But that doesn’t show up in the dot.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, in a situation where there’s relatively high uncertainty, there’s the most likely case, but the second most likely case might only be a little bit less likely."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"Speaking of which, they are not a forecast of the group, they’re not discussed or debated at the meeting, they’re an input to policy more than an output of policy, and they’re also only the most likely case."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know that my view on the dots is that they, overall, provide useful information for people, but that we need to do our absolute best to explain what they are and what they are not."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,And I think it’s just something we do.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, we’re working our way through it."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"In terms of the dots, you’re right, this is the first time, I believe, we’ve had—we’ve talked about cutting in the “dot era.” I guess the dot era began in January 2012."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I think, you know, we certainly don’t want to be seen as weak on inflation, and I don't believe we are."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"In a world where policy rates are going to be closer to the effective lower bound, then, just as a general matter, we need to be really strong on 2 percent inflation."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s one of the principal reasons why I called for the review.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"Let me say, on inflation, it’s something I’ve been concerned about for quite a long time."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,So that means a more prolonged shortfall of inflation.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"Not only that, the actual forecast for inflation for this year, among FOMC participants, dropped a couple of tenths."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,So we find that notable.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,And I noted it as a reason for us to—one of several reasons why it feels to us that the case for more accommodation has strengthened.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,We noted that also in the statement.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"We saw that market-based measures of inflation expectations, breakevens, dropped."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,So we’re saying that we know—I noted in the statement and also in my—what I said here.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,So let me let me answer the inflation question first.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,Okay.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"Okay, right."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,CHRISTOPHER CONDON.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,I see.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"Chris Condon, Bloomberg News."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"Indeed, there’s a pretty substantial body of academic literature arguing that a central bank close to the zero lower bound ought to act sooner and more aggressively than it otherwise would."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,JEANNA SMIALEK.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"Of course, we do that through changing financial conditions, and one of those is the dollar, but we don’t target the dollar."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"We have the responsibility for maximum employment and stable prices, and we use our tools to achieve that."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"The U.S. Treasury has responsibility for exchange rate policy, not the Fed, and we don’t comment, in that sense, on the level of the dollar."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,And would you support an intervention of some kind on this issue?
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,Do you think that an overvalued dollar has been a drag on America’s global competitiveness?
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"The President himself has routinely complained about the strength of the U.S. dollar, saying it has resulted in, quote, “tremendous,” close quote, competitive advantage with countries like China and others."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren has provided a proposal to revalue the U.S. dollar in order to address concerns about rising trade deficits.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"In fact, central banks—or, rather, nations, when they get together, routinely adopt a communique that says we will target our domestic, economic, and financial conditions and not our exchange rate in using monetary policy, and that includes the United States, that includes the G-20 communique that we adopted 10 days ago."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thanks, Chairman Powell."

2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,DONNA BORAK.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"That’s going to depend heavily upon, you know, the actual data and the evolving risk picture."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"Again, I don’t know what that means in terms of the size of a particular rate cut going forward."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"I don’t know—and it’s always in the—I think it’s in the minds of policymakers, you know, during this era, because it’s well understood to be correct."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,So I think that is a valid way to think about policy in this era.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"In other words, sort of, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"More generally, though, the research you refer to essentially notes that, in a world where you are closer to the effective lower bound, it’s why—research kind of shows this—it’s wise to react, for example, to prevent a weakening from turning into a prolonged weakening."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,So it would be—so nothing I can say about that is specific to the near-term question that we face.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"On the specific question of that, that’s just something we haven’t really engaged with yet, and it will depend very heavily on incoming data and the evolving risk picture as we move forward."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"I’m wondering what you think of that prescription, and if you could spend a couple of minutes discussing the pros and cons of the 50 basis point cut and how you approach that question."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"Mr. Chairman, if and when the Committee decides to cut rates, I suspect there’ll be a debate over whether to move by 25 or 50 basis points."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"On def—no, the fact that you’ve signaled rate cuts are coming."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"I would add, though, that the support for the path we took for the policy statement that we adopted was quite broad."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,So I really do look at it that way.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,And I feel like you make better decisions when you hear a disparity of views.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"Let me let me say the same thing as I said the last time, before there had been any dissents, and that is that I think the process of careful, thoughtful dissent is a very healthy one, and I’ve always believed that."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,And how do you—do you expect further dissents going forward?
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,Does that give us a sense that there was debate among a group that was pushing for a rate cut this time?
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,You had your first dissent in your time as Chairman.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,Marty Crutsinger with the AP.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"But I would just say that the risks that we see having emerged are risks that have gotten our attention and that have called a number of us to write down rate cuts, and a number of those who haven’t to see that the case has strengthened."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"In this case, you know, there’s always some judgment in these things."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,JAMES POLITI.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"Obviously, we try to avoid going prematurely as well."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,JEANNA SMIALEK.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,But I think we believe that the right thing here is to watch carefully in the near term and see how these risks unfold and see whether they continue to weigh on the outlook.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"I would say, as a general matter, it’s always something that we have to weigh."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,So I don’t think the risk of waiting too long is prominent right now.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,And we will see a lot more on all of these issues in the very near term.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we’re always trying to balance that risk, but I would say that, given the quite recent nature of some of the events, I think the Committee felt, though, that the right thing to do was to wait and see more."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,Right.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"I was hoping that you could clarify for us a little bit how you’re thinking 2 Chair Powell intended to say “business fixed investment.” about the risks of waiting too long to cut rates versus the risks of cutting rates prematurely—sort of, what the balance of risks are and how you talk about that."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"Or is—was there any concern on the Committee that this would tell consumers, tell people, “Don’t borrow now, don’t spend now, because rates will get cheaper later”?"
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,I was hoping that—this is Jeanna Smialek from the New York Times.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,[Inaudible] CHAIR POWELL.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,James Politi with the Financial Times.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,MARTIN CRUTSINGER.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,Mario Draghi at the ECB yesterday sent a strong signal of new stimulus for the euro zone.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,I’m saying you— HOWARD SCHNEIDER.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,Yes.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,HOWARD SCHNEIDER.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s the inflation question.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"Well, the fact that expected inflation went from 1.8 to— Howard Schneider with Reuters—went from 1.8 to 1.5, it’s the fact that you’re not responding to that."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,I didn’t quite follow your “dot” question.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,I’ll take the inflation one first.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,3 Chair Powell intended to say “stronger activity in the euro area.” CHAIR POWELL.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, secondly, on inflation, that was a pretty big drop in expected PCE, yet, you know, without reacting to it, are you not sort of undermining your own credibility in terms of commitment to the 2 percent target?"
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"Just two sort of related questions: Is there concern that you’ll be causing a sort of “dot deflation” by telling people, “Well, don’t buy your car now, because it’ll get cheaper in six months because we’re cutting rates,” and that that could sort of fulfill itself?"
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,HOWARD SCHNEIDER.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,HOWARD SCHNEIDER.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s our principal focus.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, I would think that, to the extent you see stronger financial conditions and stronger activity in the ECB after a rate cut, that would support—tend to support activity.3 So we’re really focused on, you know, the risks to our—on the baseline outlook, which is still a pretty favorable one, and the risks to those outlooks."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,So it could cut either way.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,So that’s our principal focus.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"And that goes for the European Central Bank, it goes for the Fed, it goes for all central banks."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,"Well, first, I think all central banks are focused on their domestic— their mandates are domestic, and they’re focused on economic conditions from a domestic standpoint."
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,This is the first time that you’ve been really issuing SEPs in an era when rates are going to be going down.
2019-06-19,Press Conf - Full Text,Do you think that such actions to ease policy at other central banks around the world will put more pressure on the Fed to do the same?
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Let me be clear.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,We’re always looking at the—we’re looking for that thing that we may have missed a lot of the time.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"But the things we haven’t missed, I think they paint a mixed picture, but not one that should prevent us from taking monetary policy actions that we think are appropriate to support the economy."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,MARTIN CRUTSINGER.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"Marty Crutsinger, AP."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,No.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"But the financial markets seem to think that this is the start of a series of rate cuts, and they’re predicting three, four cuts this year."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Is this your effort to try to damp down that—that thing?
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,And we worry about them all the time.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"You’ve talked in this press conference about being data dependent going forward, and that this is not the start of a series of rate cuts."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, one of my colleagues is the head of the Financial Stability Board globally, so we’re very, very much monitoring these things all the time."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I think all of that gives us the ability to use monetary policy for its purposes and rely on supervisory and regulatory tools to—you know, to keep the financial system resilient."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,We have a great team.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,So we look at this on an ongoing basis.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"We have—every quarter we have an extensive briefing on financial stability, and we had that yesterday."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, of course, of course, we monitor."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,There are very few things that I don’t worry about at all.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,You’re not worried about that kind of dynamic?
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"So you’re not doing something today for—to help today, and then it’s going to cause problems down the road?"
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,GREG ROBB.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,So we’re watching that very carefully.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, again, I think if you look overall at the U.S. financial system, what you see is a high level of resilience—much higher than it was before the crisis—and that’s something to take comfort from."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"What I said was, it’s not—it’s not the beginning of a long series of rate cuts."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,We liaise with central banks around the world.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,I didn’t—I didn’t say it’s just one or anything like that.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,You would do that if you saw real economic weakness and you thought that the federal funds rate needed to be cut a lot.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,They’re not large as it relates to the U.S. economy.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, nonetheless, it’s clear that the highly leveraged business sector could act as an amplifier to a downturn."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, the mechanical effects of the tariffs are quite small."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,How much of an effect could the tariffs have?
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,DON LEE.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"Again, with—with trade policy, we’re just going to be watching and trying to assess the implications for the—for the U.S. outlook."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"You’ve seen it returning to—to a much lower temperature, I think."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"But then we saw them unwind after that, to some extent."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,We saw that in June.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"Certainly, we’ve seen, though, that when there’s a sharp confrontation between two large economies, you can see effects on business confidence pretty quickly and on financial markets pretty quickly."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"And without knowing—you know, I think we—with trade, we have to react to the developments, and we don’t know what they’ll be, and so it’s hard to exactly say."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"That certainly includes the discussions with China, but I wouldn’t—I wouldn’t be able to tell you how much of it is due to that."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"What I said is, when you think about rate-cutting cycles, they go on for a long time, and the Committee is not seeing that—not seeing us in that place."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think we look at a broad range of factors, and trade uncertainty—trade policy uncertainty is one of them."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"And if the current stalemate and the threat of more tariffs continue, what would that mean for future interest rates and possible cuts?"
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Could you say how much of a factor the U.S.–China trade conflict was in the Fed’s decision to cut rates?
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,You mentioned the difficulty of assessing trade tensions in the economic outlook.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Don Lee with the L.A. Times.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,DON LEE.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think, if you look back at other midcycle adjustments, you’ll see—you know, I don’t know that they’ll be, in the end, comparable or not, but you’ll see examples of these."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s—that’s really what I was ruling out.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"What I said was, it’s not a long cutting cycle—in other words, referring to what we do when there’s a recession or a very severe downturn."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"What we’re seeing is that it’s appropriate to—to adjust policy to a somewhat more accommodative stance over time, and that’s how we’re looking at it."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s not what we’re seeing.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s not what we’re seeing.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, you know, I wouldn’t bring it down to any one trade thing or any one factor."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"What’s happening with business borrowing is, the loans have moved off the balance sheets of the banks and into market-based vehicles, which tend to be stably funded."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,There really is no reason why the expansion can’t keep going.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, overall, staff’s view has been—and my view has been—that if you look overall, financial stability vulnerabilities are moderate."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,There’s no place in our discussions for that.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,We never take into account political considerations.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"So that’s what we’re doing, and that’s why we’re doing it."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,I think what you see is an economy that has reacted well to that.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"That’s what we’ve been talking about all year long, and we’ve gradually moved our policy in the direction of more accommodation."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, just to touch on that again, this action is designed to insure against downside risks to the outlook from weak global growth and trade tensions, offset the negative effect that those factors are already having, and promote a faster return of inflation to 2 percent."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I gave my—my reasons for—our reasons, really—for doing this."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,And could you also elaborate a little bit further on why the Fed decided to speed up its balance sheet runoff two months earlier today?
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,What do you say to those that say that the Fed gave into what the President wanted today?
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,The President has repeatedly called for this rate hike and for the Fed to end the runoff of its balance sheet.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,DONNA BORAK.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, I would say, overall, we’re trying to sustain the expansion and keep, you know, close to our statutory goals, which are maximum employment and stable prices."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,So—and we hope to help that with this rate cut.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s at a healthy level but not growing much.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,The manufacturing economy—the investment and manufacturing part of the economy—is more or less not—not growing much.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"Now, the engine, though, is really a consumer economy, which is 70 percent of the economy."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"You have a fairly well-balanced, in a sense, economy."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"If you look at the—at the U.S. economy right now, there’s no sector that’s booming and therefore might bust."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Inflation is not troublingly high.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I guess my view is, the best thing we can do for those people is to sustain the expansion, keep it going, and that’s one of the overarching goals of—of this move and all of our policy moves."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"Well, I think the best thing for people who are—who are feeling that—and we are getting lots of feedback from people who work and live in low- and moderate- income communities to the effect that they’re now feeling the recovery, and, in fact, they haven’t felt a better labor market in anybody’s memory, so this is great to hear."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Can you elaborate a little bit on how this rate cut is expected to help them?
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"The real question is, what are the effects on the economy through the—through the confidence channel—business confidence channel?"
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,We also don’t conduct monetary policy in order to prove our independence.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"We conduct monetary policy in order to—to move as close as possible to our statutory goals, and that’s what we’re always going to do."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,We’re always going to use our tools that way.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"And then, at the end, we’ll—you know, we’ll live with the results."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"Leverage in the financial system is low, and funding risk is low."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,I’ll come back to business borrowing.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Households are in a very good shape overall.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"In terms of household borrowing, household and business borrowing is the second thing."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we do see notable valuation pressures in some markets but, you know, honestly, not at a highly troubling level."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,But the four things we look at are valuation pressures.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we look at, really, four big things so that we know we can—you know, the public can hold us accountable and compare us meeting to meeting, and—you know, and see whether we got this right, because it’s transparent now."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"Before the crisis, we didn’t have this, but now we have it, and we publish it."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"And one of the reasons why I think that is, if you look—if you look—so we have a financial stability framework now for the first time."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,I just don’t think—that would be my point.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"But as I look at today’s situation, I don’t see them as a reason not to take this action today."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"I’ve—you know, I’ve studied them, I’ve spoken about them, and I take them very seriously."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"The place that gets all the attention right now—a lot of attention—is business borrowing, and we look very carefully at that."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,I do.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Yes.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,So could you talk about that?
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"I’ve collected a couple of things from the IMF, and the Bank of International Settlements said that it’s just—when you have low rates, you just get more debt in the economy, and that there’s also this feeling that it makes it harder to raise rates."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,So I was wondering if you could talk about what you—what was your response to them when those concerns were raised?
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"I was wondering—we weren’t in the room, but I think it’s a fair assumption to know that the two dissenters probably spoke about financial stability concerns."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Greg Robb from MarketWatch.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you, Chairman Powell."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,GREG ROBB.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Really nothing more to it than that.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"In terms of the balance sheet, that was really just a matter of simplicity and consistency."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, first, let me say—I’ll just speak for myself, but I understand those concerns very well."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, again, very, very hard to tease that out."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"There really—there really is nothing in the U.S. economy that presents a—you know, a prominent near-term threat to the U.S. economy."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"That’s to say, not trivial."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,And I think it’s a good time.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,I think it’s opened us up to sunlight and perspectives that we might not have gotten otherwise.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,I think it’s been a good exercise.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,I’m very excited about it.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,I expect we’ll be at this a while.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"So it’s very early to say where that’s going, but, you know, we’re setting the table now and looking at what our framework is and looking at how it’s performed, looking at how all frameworks performed around the world during the Global Financial Crisis."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’re just now beginning the process of incorporating all of that feedback, and we’re going to be having a series of meetings, beginning today and yesterday, as we evaluate, you know, the questions that we’re asking about our framework."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"I’ve got to say, it’s been even better than I hoped it would be."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s been—it’s been great.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we meet there with the constituencies that we serve, and they’ve been very, very successful, hearing from people—not just—not just economists, but people who are not economists, how—how their lives interact with the Fed’s work."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Soon it will be all the Reserve Banks.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’ve had—so far we’ve had a series of meetings, called Fed Listens, at almost all the Reserve Banks."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s not something that enters directly into our discussions today.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,So the monetary policy review is really for—it’s really there to look at the way we make policy in the longer run.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,And have the discussions so far this year had any bearing on today’s decision?
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Can you give us an update on the ongoing reassessment of the inflation framework?
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Jean Yung with MNI."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,JEAN YUNG.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’ll use all of our tools aggressively, as we need to, when that time comes."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"And you’re right, there will eventually be one."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,A couple of rate hikes one way or the other isn’t going to matter so much if there is a downturn.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I think, you know, we will use the tools that we have."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"And the other thing is, I think by extending the cycle, you—you do have a lot of benefits from that."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"It doesn’t seem—it doesn’t seem like something that’s in—you know, particularly likely, frankly, but we don’t know that."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, you have—10 years after the crisis, you’re really living in a new normal for the economy and monetary policy, and it’s a really good time to step back and ask whether there are some things that we can do to improve our framework."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,COURTENAY BROWN.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Mr. Chairman."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Courtenay Brown from Axios.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,So— thank you.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"But—and, by the way, those risks from abroad are affecting the manufacturing sector here and business investment—fixed investment."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, of course, we are concerned about—about low inflation."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Downside risks are really coming from abroad.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s— it’s healthy, so I would say that."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s—it’s within—within the economy.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Nothing like that.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"As I mentioned, there’s no—there’s no segment that’s really—or sector that’s really boiling over and overheating."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,You’ve talked a number of times about the people who feel like they are just recently getting to the punchbowl 10 years into this expansion.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we do—we have had these global, really, risks to the outlook."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"Yeah, so again, I see the U.S. outlook as being a positive one."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"Again, I don’t know whether that’ll happen right here."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, just wondering if you can kind of clarify all those things within the context of the challenges of communicating it."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,So the Fed added language in the statement that says that the Committee is contemplating the future path of the target range for the federal funds rate as it monitors implications.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"Just to expand on that point about communication, I mean, we saw that markets have been particularly sensitive with regards to New York Fed President John Williams’s remarks before the blackout period."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Brian Cheung with Yahoo Finance."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,BRIAN CHEUNG.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"Of course, we always retain the flexibility to adjust our communications and our actions to—in light of incoming data and the evolving risk picture, but—I’ll leave it there."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"We do know that monetary policy works through communications and then actions that are consistent with those communications, and we think that the changes that we’ve made this year have really worked."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"They’ve been well telegraphed, and I think—you know, I think they will—they will achieve their goals."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,I had mentioned the reasons for it.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,What we did today was—was very consistent with what we had said we were going to do.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,So I think this was—this was well telegraphed.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Can you give us a sense of whether the Committee feels constrained at all by the market’s expectations for more cuts or other developments in financial markets?
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"I’m wondering—now there’s kind of this inflection point about whether or not the downside risk, because you’ve had to cut rates, outweighs the fact that you still see a positive outlook of the U.S. economy at a baseline."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"I’ve seen some research, which—you know, which says that they are meaningful—meaningful effects on—on output."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"In other—in other long, long cycles, long U.S. business cycles have sometimes involved this kind of event where the Fed will stop hiking—in fact, will cut—and then will go back to hiking."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"Well, but you’re assuming that we would never raise rates again, that once we’ve cut these rates that they can never go back up again."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"So the problems at Wells Fargo—that arose at Wells Fargo around risk management and consumer—the way they dealt with the consumer were actually pretty deep, and I think the company realizes that."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I’m also curious whether their lack of a permanent CEO has hampered progress, in your eyes."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,And I was wondering if you could characterize the progress that the bank has made towards the shortcomings that it had in its risk-management processes.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,So it’s been about 18 months since the Fed issued its enforcement action against Wells Fargo.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, John Heltman with American Banker."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,JOHN HELTMAN.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’re going to be, as we always are, doing what we need to do—what we believe we need to do to support the economic expansion."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,We’re going to be data dependent.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"In terms of the way forward, we will be monitoring the factors that I mentioned, and we laid that out in the—you know, in the postmeeting statement, and that’s the roadmap we’re going to be following going forward."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"And that means people have a responsibility to do their best thinking and to present that thinking, and I wouldn’t have it any other way."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"There’s a range of views on the Committee, and—but the Committee is unified, completely unified on our dedication to making the best policy decisions that we can make."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, you’re right."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, how much consensus do you want to see around these decisions, and how split are people about this?"
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,And I’m wondering if that reflects a greater lack of consensus on the Committee.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,What I’m hearing is a reluctance to provide more guidance around the future path of rates.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,The Dow is down as much as 400 points.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"As the press conference—as this press conference has gone under way, markets have declined."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thanks for the question, Chairman."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Paul Kiernan from Dow Jones Newswires.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,PAUL KIERNAN.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"Many of them have made adjustments, and they’ve gotten to a place where it’s okay, but it’s—it’s been a challenge."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"You have to look at a range of estimates, and I think businesses will tell you that it’s a factor, particularly businesses that have—manufacturing businesses that have supply chains that cross international borders will all tell you that it’s been a challenge."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I think that that sounds right, but it’s quite hard to get—there is no way to get an accurate measure."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"And they’re not going to be fixed—they haven’t been fixed quickly, and, frankly, we didn’t expect them to be fixed quickly."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"So they’re—you know, they—they will be under the growth cap, our enforcement action, until the Board votes to lift it, and that’s not something we’re considering doing right now."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"And the Committee—I mean, the company is working away to address these issues, but, as I said, they’re deep-seated issues, and it just takes time to address them."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,I wouldn’t comment on the CEO question.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mean, you will have—have less ammo, in that sense."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,But you won’t be able to cut as much if—if rates are low.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,So— NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s one thing.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"Again, I’m not predicting that, but I don’t think that we know that we won’t have—that we’ll have less ammo because of these things."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we don’t know when—and if it really works—if that works very well and the economy gets going again, you know, you don’t know where the—where the funds, in other cycles—and I don’t know whether this will happen or not, but in other cycles, the Fed wound up raising rates again after a midcycle adjustment."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"If you remember whether—again, one of the purposes of our—of our cut today is to support the expansion."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, the premise is not—I will question your premise for a second."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,How big of a problem will that be?
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"So when we have our next recession, the Fed will have less room—it will happen—the Fed will have less room to maneuver cutting interest rates since you’re cutting now."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"Just as a matter of principle, I don’t think that’s right."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Nancy Marshall-Genzer with Marketplace.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, we’ll lift the growth cap when we’re satisfied."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think they do see it as we do, as something that has to go deep."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,They take it seriously.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,The company is working away at addressing it.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,We have—we have an enforcement action in place.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know—I mean, I have characterized it."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,I’m not going to characterize it.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Do you feel like this is going the way that you kind of wanted it to go?
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mean, I just—I’d like to clarify, like, are you pleased with the responsiveness you’re getting from them?"
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,JOHN HELTMAN.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,I don’t really have anything for you on that.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Scott Horsley for NPR.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"Chairman Powell, Donna Borak with CNN."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,SCOTT HORSLEY.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mean, I think we—of course, you know, what we do at every meeting, as I noted, is, we do a deep dive into U.S. economic activity and global activity and, certainly, carefully went through U.S. economic activity, which there has been some positive and some negative, but, overall, the U.S. economy has shown resilience during the intermeeting period."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, yes."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"And if we keep seeing these upside surprises, does that change or evolve any FOMC thinking going forward?"
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Can you give us a sense of how that better-than-expected data impacted the FOMC’s thinking?
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"You always say that the Fed is data dependent, and much of the data that we’ve seen since the June meeting has surprised to the upside or at least been in line with expectations."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Heather Long from the Washington Post."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,HEATHER LONG.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,It just—it seems to work through confidence channels as well as the mechanical channels that you are talking about.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,You see economic activity on a healthy basis.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"You see confidence, which had troughed in June—you saw it move back up."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"Since—you know, since we noted our vigilance about the situation in June, you saw financial conditions move up, and you saw—I won’t take credit for the whole recovery, but you saw financial conditions move up."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,And I think you see it.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,It will—and it will work.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,So it will lower borrowing costs.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, I—I really think it does, and I think the evidence of my eyes tells me that our policy does support—it supports confidence, it supports economic activity, household and business confidence, and through channels that we understand."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"How does cutting interest rates lower—or, how does cutting interest rates keep that going, since the cost of capital doesn’t seem to be the issue here?"
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"But the follow-up question is, how does it do that?"
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHAEL MCKEE.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, frankly, it is a continuation of what we’ve been doing all year to provide more support against those very same risks."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we see those as threats to what is clearly a favorable outlook, and we see this action as designed to support them and keep that outlook favorable."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"In addition, we see trade policy developments, which at times have been disruptive and then have been less so, and also inflation running below target."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"What we’ve been monitoring since the beginning of the year is, effectively, downside risks to that outlook from weakening global growth, and we see that everywhere: weak manufacturing, weak global growth now, particularly in the European Union and China."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"The position of the economy is as close to our objectives as it’s been in a long time, and the outlook is also good."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, again, the—the issue is more the downside risks and then the shortfall in inflation, and we’re trying to address those."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, in addition, going forward, I would say, we’re going to be monitoring those same things."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’ll be monitoring the evolution of trade uncertainty, of global growth, and of low inflation."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we’ll also, of course, be watching the performance of the U.S. economy."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,NICK TIMIRAOS.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s really not our job.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,We’re not in any way criticizing trade policy.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,We play no role whatsoever in assessing or evaluating trade policies other than as—as trade policy uncertainty has an effect on the U.S. economy in the short and medium term.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, by the way, I want to be clear here."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"With trade tensions— which do seem to be having a significant effect on financial market conditions and on the economy—they evolve in a different way, and we have to follow them."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"And it is not—it’s not exactly the same as watching global growth, where you see growth weakening, you see central banks and governments responding with fiscal policy, and you see growth strengthening, and you see a business cycle."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,So it is a—it’s something that we haven’t faced before and that we’re learning by doing.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"We don’t—you know, the thing is, there isn’t a lot of experience in responding to global trade tensions."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Trade is unusual.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,But there’s definitely an insurance aspect of it.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,The—the performance of the economy has been reasonably good.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"You see it now in the second quarter: You see weak investment, you see weak manufacturing—so support demand there and also to support return of inflation to 2 percent."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"So that is—in a sense, that is a risk-management point, and that is a bit of insurance."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I gave three reasons for what we did, and that is to insure against downside risks to the outlook from weak global growth and trade tensions."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Yes.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"What—how do we know what you’re going to do next, and why now in this new regime?"
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"And are we now more in the realm of watching headlines of trade talks than we are watching unemployment rate and inflation numbers, or—and growth numbers?"
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,This is sort of an insurance cut and not a data-dependent cut?
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Would you say we’re sort of—you guys have gotten into a new regime here?
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,I just want to follow up on that.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"Steve Liesman, CNBC."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,STEVE LIESMAN.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"As I mentioned, it had shown some resilience here to those issues, and we’ll be putting all of that together, and that’s how we’ll be thinking about policy going forward."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,But we also feel like weak global growth and trade tensions are having an effect on the U.S. economy.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, you’re absolutely right."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"And so, wondering exactly what problem lower capital costs will solve."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Consumption— supported by rising incomes and high household confidence—is the main engine driving the economy forward.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,GDP growth in the second quarter came in close to expectations.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,We expect job growth to be slower than last year but above what we believe is required to hold the unemployment rate steady.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"Job growth was strong in June and, looking through month-to-month fluctuations, the data point to continued strength."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"Since then, we have seen both positive and negative developments."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"At our June meeting, many Committee participants saw that the case for lowering the federal funds rate had strengthened, but the Committee wanted to get a better sense of the overall direction of events."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,These changes in the anticipated path of interest rates have eased financial conditions and have supported the economy.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"The median Committee participant’s assessments of the neutral rate of interest and the longer-run normal rate of unemployment have also declined this year, reinforcing the case for a somewhat lower path for our policy rate."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,The Committee moved from expecting rate increases this year to a patient stance about any changes and then to today’s action.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"Through the course of the year, weak global growth, trade policy uncertainty, and muted inflation have prompted the FOMC to adjust its assessment of the appropriate path of interest rates."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,This underscores for us the importance of sustaining the expansion so that the strong job market reaches more of those left behind.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,People who live and work in low- and middle-income communities tell us that many who have struggled to find work are now getting opportunities to add new and better chapters to their lives.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"But manufacturing output has declined for two consecutive quarters, and business fixed investment fell in the second quarter."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"Wages have been rising, particularly for lower-paying jobs."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Our interest rate target was at the low end of estimates of neutral.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"The unemployment rate was below 4 percent, and inflation had been running near our 2 percent objective for nine months."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"As the year began, both the economy and monetary policy were in a good place."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,And I’ll discuss the thinking behind today’s interest rate reduction and then turn to the path forward.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"We also decided to conclude the runoff of our securities portfolio in August rather than in September, as previously planned."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"All of these objectives will support achievement of our overarching goal: to sustain the expansion, with a strong job market and inflation close to our objective, for the benefit of the American people."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"It is intended to insure against downside risks from weak global growth and trade policy uncertainty, to help offset the effects these factors are currently having on the economy, and to promote a faster return of inflation to our symmetric 2 percent objective."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"The outlook for the U.S. economy remains favorable, and this action is designed to support that outlook."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,We decided today to lower the target for the federal funds rate by ¼ percentage point to a range of 2 percent to 2¼ percent.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"Good afternoon, and welcome."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"Transcript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference July 31, 2019 CHAIR POWELL."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"Over the first half of the year, the economy grew at a healthy pace and job gains pushed unemployment to near a half-century low."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"Foreign growth has disappointed, particularly in manufacturing and notably in the euro area and China."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"After simmering early in the year, trade policy tensions nearly boiled over in May and June but now appear to have returned to a simmer."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Michael McKee from Bloomberg Television and Radio.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHAEL MCKEE.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we do think it will serve all of those goals, but again, we’re thinking of it as essentially in the nature of a midcycle adjustment to policy."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"In terms of the rest of your question, the Committee is really thinking of this as a way of adjusting policy to a somewhat more accommodative stance to further the three objectives that I mentioned: to insure against downside risks, to provide support to the economy, that those factors are—where factors are pushing down on economic growth, and then to support inflation."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I think—I wouldn’t take credit for all of that, but I do think that increasing policy support has kept the economy on track and kept the outlook favorable."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think what you’ve seen over the course of the year is, as we’ve moved to a more accommodative policy, the economy has actually performed just about as expected with that gradually increasing support."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"As I noted in my opening statement, we started off expecting some rate increases, we moved to a patient setting for a few months, and now we’ve moved here."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I think you have to look at not just the 25 basis point cut, but look at the Committee’s actions over the course of the year."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,What is the hurdle rate there?
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, if not, what are you going to be looking at to convince you that you need to cut rates again?"
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"Per your statement here, I guess the question is, is there any reason to believe that a 25 basis point cut is going to be sufficient to expediently return inflation to your 2 percent target?"
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"In response to this weakness, many central banks around the world are increasing policy accommodation or contemplating doing so."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Jeanna Smialek with the New York Times.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,JEANNA SMIALEK.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,I am happy to take your questions.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"Today, we judge that those factors warrant the policy adjustment I described: “As the Committee contemplates the future path of the target range for the federal funds rate, it will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook and will act as appropriate to sustain the expansion, with a strong labor market and inflation near its symmetric 2 percent objective.” Thank you."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"Over the year, however, incoming information on global growth, trade policy uncertainty, and muted inflation have led the Committee to gradually lower its assessments of the path of policy interest rate that would best support that outlook."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"So taking all of that on board, the Committee still sees a favorable baseline outlook."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"We are mindful that inflation’s return to 2 percent may be further delayed, and that continued below-target inflation could lead to a worrisome and difficult-to-reverse downward slide in longer-term expectations."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"Wages are rising, but not at a pace that would put much upward pressure on inflation."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"But domestic inflation pressures remain muted, and global disinflationary pressures persist."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,We continue to expect that inflation will return over time to 2 percent.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"Core inflation, which excludes food and energy prices and is a better gauge of future developments than is total inflation, has run at 1.6 percent over the past 12 months."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,The domestic inflation shortfall has continued.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"Looking through this variability, our business contacts tell us that the ongoing uncertainty is making some companies more cautious about their capital spending."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Chair Powell."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, Chair Powell, you and your colleagues have offered three reasons to cut rates: a lower neutral rate that may have made policy a little bit tighter than anticipated, the global slowdown and the darker risk picture from the trade tensions, and this desire to re-center inflation and inflation expectations."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"There’s a perception out there that perhaps, in this case, the Fed is something of a hammer in search of a nail, because the latest consumer spending reports, as you suggested, don’t seem to show any kind of demand problem in the U.S. And when you look at mortgage rates, auto lending rates, they’ve all come down."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, more importantly, is a ¼ point cut really going to address all of that, let alone any one of those?"
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"And so, conceptually, you can think of—I’m not saying it’s the same thing as a countercyclical capital buffer."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’ve, in effect, already put in place substantial countercyclical buffers."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"The idea being, in a sense, we’ve chosen, in the United States, to have high through-the-cycle capital requirements by doubling the SIFI surcharge, which is the surcharge that the largest banks have in their capital requirements."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s a—it’s one under consideration.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,The idea that you’re talking about is one that’s—that Vice Chair Quarles has talked about.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,I do agree with that.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, on the first, I would say that I view the level of capital requirements and the level of capital in the system as being about right."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Okay.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Do you think that that is a fair assessment?
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"And then, also, just quickly, on real-time payments—larger banks have suggested that if the Fed built its own system, that would be a bait-and-switch, because the Fed asked—or called for a private-sector system."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,I was wondering if you agreed with that.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"On capital, Vice Chairman Quarles has said that the level of capital requirements that exists right now are such that it’s basically like the countercyclical capital buffer is already turned on, and that he would like the ability to be able to turn it down in a downturn."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Victoria Guida with Politico.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Hi.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,VICTORIA GUIDA.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, so I—that’s really where I would leave you with that."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"And so we’re going to be monitoring the implications of incoming information for the outlook, as I mentioned."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, so our policy is—will depend on the implications of incoming data for the economic outlook as well as evolving risks to that outlook."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"Or are you predicting that, you know, once you’ve embarked on this easing, you will have to at least move by one more notch going forward?"
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"Are there any circumstances under which you would decide to pause—pause at one interest rate cut, today’s interest rate cut, and not—not, not go ahead with further monetary easing at this stage?"
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Hi there.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,JAMES POLITI.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s not our perspective now or outlook.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,So that’s—that’s really the point—is that we don’t rely—our system doesn’t rely on our ability—it doesn’t mainly rely on our ability to identify the right time in the cycle to trigger a countercyclical tool.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"We rely on through-the-cycle, always-on high capital and liquidity requirements."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"The idea of putting it in place so you can cut it, that’s something some other jurisdictions have done, and it’s worth considering."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think the United Kingdom, in particular, has a countercyclical capital buffer that’s always on, but the one point of it is that you can cut when there’s a downturn and therefore give the banks more room."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,We’ll be looking at that to make our decisions going forward.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"I wonder, which of those factors, if any, weighs most heavily on you?"
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"And that’s what we’re going to be looking—you know, we’ll be looking at incoming data, at all of the—at the risks that I mentioned, and the performance of the U.S. economy, and at low inflation."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s what we’re seeing.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"But as we look at the situation now and the outlook now, what we see is that it’s appropriate to make an adjustment in policy to a somewhat more accommodative stance."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"So it is—as I mentioned, it’s going to depend on the evolving data and the evolving risk picture."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Or simply that this policy bias will come out of the statement sooner than market participants think?
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"Does that mean, you know, with one or two more cuts you’ll be done, and this policy bias comes out of the statement?"
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,So what are you saying?
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, on the other hand, you say it’s not the start of a—of an easing cycle."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"In that tilt, market participants are interpreting this language, “will act as appropriate,” as still being in the statement."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,That is not—that’s not what we’re seeing now.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"On the one hand, you say the policy tilt in the statement has eased financial conditions, and that’s helping the economy."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Craig Torres from Bloomberg.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,CRAIG TORRES.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"We have not made a decision on this, but it’s something we’re looking at carefully and something I do expect we’ll make a decision on soon."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I would point out that in our payment system, in many places, the Fed operates alongside private-sector operators—for example, in wholesale payments, in ACH, and in check—so it wouldn’t be unusual or out of keeping with—with how we’ve done things in the past."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,They were overwhelmingly favorable.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"We put out a proposal in October of last year about, you know, should we do this, and we got quite a lot of comments."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,And one of the things that came out of that was a recommendation that the Fed should build a 24 x 7 x 365 real-time settlement system to solve that problem—to address that problem.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"This is consumer groups, technology companies, banks, card companies—pretty much all of the groups who would be interested—and worked on a project for several years."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"The Fed, really, coming out of the Reserve System—the Reserve Banks and the Board together—convened all of the stakeholders around the table to talk about how we can move forward."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"In terms of the real-time payment system, your second question, so this is something we—the United States is far behind other countries in terms of having real-time payments available to the general public."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s just under consideration.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,So this isn’t something we’ve decided to do.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,I’m trying to parse what you’re saying here.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,And I think that’s a good thing to do.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,ANN SAPHIR.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think we’ll continue to learn more, and on inflation we will."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, we’re going to be seeing—I think we’ve learned a lot on trade in this cycle."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,We’ll see that picture.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we will see whether growth is picking up, whether it’s bottoming out."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,And I think you see—you learn—every cycle you learn about these things.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,We’ll be looking very carefully to see how that’s happening.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, you know, I can’t— all I can tell you is, we’ll be looking at weak global growth."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"So it says, as we’re contemplating the future path of the target range for the federal funds rate, we’ll continue to monitor the implications of incoming information—and it talks about that language."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we, as we noted—we noted at the bottom of the statement that language, which really says how we’re thinking about it."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Yes.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"Where is that bar right now, because I think there’s some confusion about how the Committee is responding."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, in addition, the U.S. economy itself is—the performance of the U.S. economy will enter into that."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"In June, you seemed to suggest that if the outlook didn’t improve, there might be a rate cut."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,NICK TIMIRAOS.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, again, I wouldn’t just look at the 25 basis point cut as the right question."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I think, in a way, that’s monetary policy working."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Growth in the first half of this year is about the same as it was in all of ’18 and actually a little better than our forecast for growth in 2019—at the end of 2019.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,You see an economy which is actually performing pretty well.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I think we’ve been providing—and that affects the forward rate path, and it affects financial conditions, and financial conditions affect the economy."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think you have to look back over the course of the year and see the Committee moving away from rate increases to a neutral posture to, now, a rate cut."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, again, I don’t think asking about a ¼ point is really the right question."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"You mentioned lower r*, trade slowdown— and I would actually add, lower natural rate of unemployment too has moved down, all of which kind of point to more accommodation."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,So we’re not at the beginning of a lengthy cutting cycle?
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,So I actually think different people have different—different weightings has been my experience on those things.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"If I could follow up, I guess in May—in May it seemed as if you were setting a higher bar to cut rates: There would need to be a deterioration in the outlook."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I would love to be more precise, but with trade, it is a factor that we have to assess in kind of a new way."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,We’ll also see on trade.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"Those are the things that we’ll be looking at, and—you know, in making our decisions going forward."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I’m contrasting it there with the beginning—for example, the beginning of a lengthy cutting cycle."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"Well, the sense of that is—I mean, that refers back to other times when the FOMC has cut rates in the middle of a cycle."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"You called it “a midcycle adjustment to policy.” And, I mean, what should we take this to mean, and what message do you mean to send with this move today about future rate moves?"
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Ann Saphir with Reuters.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,ANN SAPHIR.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,And I’ve already gone over how we’re thinking about going forward.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"In terms of, is this the—we believe this is the right move for today, and we think it’s—we think it will serve the three ends that I mentioned."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, by the way, trade policy uncertainty has also been, I think, more elevated than we anticipated."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think there’s a—there’s a global business cycle happening with manufacturing and investment, and that’s—that’s been, you know, definitely a bigger factor than, certainly, we expected late last year."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,And I wouldn’t lay all of that at the door of trade talks.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Investment—business investment is weak.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,You see manufacturing being weak all over the world.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think global—global growth started to slow down in the middle of last year, but that has gone on to a greater extent."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"They don’t come in and say, “We’re not investing because, you know, the federal funds rate is too high.” I haven’t heard that from a business."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Edward Lawrence with Fox Business Network.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,What you hear is that demand is weak for their products.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"So a rate hike last December was seen by some economists and the St. Louis Fed president, James Bullard, as a step too far."
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Now the Fed’s waited about seven months for a rate cut.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,EDWARD LAWRENCE.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"So could some of the weakness on the business side, with that fixed investment and the sluggish side on the business side, be because the Fed waited so long?"
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,You said today you were concerned about downside risks.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Yes.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,So we don’t hear that from businesses.
2019-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,I want to get your thoughts on that and talk about why you feel that this nudge is the right level.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Don Lee with the L.A. Times.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,How much—can you talk about the mechanism in which the two rate cuts will affect the real economy?
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,DON LEE.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,I also think there’s a confidence channel.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,And how much—to what extent will it offset the negative effects of the trade uncertainty and tensions?
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, you know, we think that lower interest rates will reduce interest burden for borrowers, so that interest-sensitive things like housing and durable goods and other things like that—cars—it supports purchases of those."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, in terms of how our rate cuts will affect the real economy, first, we think monetary policy works with, as Friedman said, long and variable lags."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,So I think the real effects will be felt over time.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"By the way, we are in the middle of a monetary policy review where we’re looking through all of these questions about the longer-run framework—the strategy, tools, and communications—and we expect that to be completed sometime around the middle of next year."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s—the models and the data show that that’s another powerful channel.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Just, again, broadly, more accommodative financial conditions—higher asset prices."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,I just don’t think those will be at the top of our list.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, in terms of firepower, I think the general principle, as I mentioned earlier, is, it can be a mistake to try to hold onto your firepower until a downturn gains momentum, and then—so there’s a fair amount of research that would show that that’s the case."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I think if we were to find ourselves at some future date again at the effective lower bound—again, not something we are expecting—then I think we would look at using large-scale asset purchases and forward guidance."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,We did not use negative rates.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,We feel that they worked fairly well.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"We chose to—after we got to the effective lower bound, we chose to do a lot of aggressive forward guidance and also large-scale asset purchases, and those were the two unconventional monetary policy tools that we used extensively."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,So negative interest rates is something that we looked at during the financial crisis and chose not to do.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,You mentioned negative interest rates.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"If, in fact, the economy weakens more, then we’re prepared to be aggressive, and we’ll do so if it turns out to be appropriate."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"As I mentioned, we are watching carefully to see whether that is the case."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,What we believe we’re facing here—what we think we’re facing here is a situation which can be addressed and should be addressed with moderate adjustments to the federal funds rate.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Now, I think that principle needs to be applied carefully to the situation at hand."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,You see—you see household and business confidence turn up when financial conditions become more accommodative.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,I do not think we’d be looking at using negative rates.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I think, through all of those channels, monetary policy works."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"It does not have the makings of anything that would undermine the workings of the financial system, for example, or itself create a shock that would turn the economy down."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"And if it comes to it, we’ll use all of our tools."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,We’re actually looking—the Financial Stability Board is actually conducting a project right now to identify where these loans are held all around the world.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,And are there any other tools that you could use before having to go there?
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"We take it very seriously, though, and, you know, we’re monitoring it carefully."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s more of—it’s more of an amplifier.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"So that’s something we’re monitoring, and I think our view still is that that’s a real issue, but what it really represents is a potential amplifier of a macroeconomic downturn."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"You get—you know, you do get that kind of phenomenon in a long cycle."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Nonetheless, there are a lot of highly levered companies, and that’s the kind of thing that happens during a long cycle when there aren’t downturns for, now, into our 11th year."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, actually, the business sector itself is not materially higher leveraged than it was."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"However, so is the size of the business sector."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"The business sector is something that, you know, we’ve talked about a lot and studied a lot, and the situation there is that the level of debt relative to GDP in the business sector is at a high level."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"That doesn’t mean that every single person in the household sector is in good shape, but, overall, it’s really not a concern."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,So the household sector as a sort of aggregate matter is in very good shape.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,And they’re in very good shape—much better shape than they were in before the financial crisis.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"It isn’t, you know, precisely the right tool for every single possible negative thing that can happen to the economy, but, nonetheless, it broadly works, and, you know, we’re going to use the tool we have."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,They’ve got more income relative to their interest requirements.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,They’re less levered.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, so, if you look at—if you actually look at households, households are in very strong shape."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Chair Powell, are you worried that the low interest rates are adding to, or could create a bubble of, consumer and corporate debt that could make it more difficult for, especially, consumers to recover from the next recession or survive the next recession?"
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,I’m Nancy Marshall-Genzer with Marketplace.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’ll— we’ll use our tools to offset negative—that’s really the job of monetary policy, is, to the extent it can, to offset, you know, things that drive us away from maximum employment and stable prices."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s—you know, it’s tough to say."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s very hard to say.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"And how much will it offset the trade impact, do you think?"
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,DON LEE.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,So that’s how we think it works and how we think it’s working.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,They’ve got less debt.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,And is there any scenario in which you would envision rates drifting lower into negative territory?
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"In the last few weeks, have you figured out how to incorporate trade uncertainty—and this level of trade uncertainty—into monetary policy going forward?"
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Donna Borak with CNN.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I think what we need to do is to try to look through the volatility and react to the underlying forces, the underlying things that are happening that are relevant to our mandate."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"But what it amounts to is this: What you see is probably the kind of volatility that’s typical of an important, complex, ongoing negotiation."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"There’s no simple bottom-line answer where I can say, yes, I’ve got it for you here."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mean, it’s a challenge."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Well, I think, yeah."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,So have you figured out how to navigatge it?
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,EDWARD LAWRENCE.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,But I was making the point that there is a piece of this that we really can’t address.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,They do.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, you know, I don’t want to be heard to say that our tools don’t have an effect."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we think our policy tools support economic activity through fairly well-understood channels: by reducing interest burden and encouraging consumer purchase of durables, of homes, and other interest-sensitive items; by creating broadly more accommodative financial conditions, which support spending and also investment by businesses; and also by boosting household and business confidence."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"But we do have a very powerful tool which can counteract weakness, to some extent, by supporting demand through sound monetary policy."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,We don’t have that tool.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,We can’t do that.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I pointed out in recent remarks that the thing we can’t address, really, is what businesses would like, which is a settled roadmap for international trade."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,And our discussions and the research we have suggests that trade policy is something that’s weighing on the outlook.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’re talking about it because anything that affects the achievement of our goals can, in principle, be something that monetary policy should take into consideration."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,But—so why are we talking about it?
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"So my point, really, was that—to start, that trade policy is not the business of the Fed, it’s the business of Congress and the Administration."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,You’ve talked about uncertainty many times today.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,About a month ago or so you said that there’s no precedent to integrate trade uncertainty into monetary policy.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, about a month ago—Edward Lawrence from Fox Business Network."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,EDWARD LAWRENCE.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"So it’s the subject of a lot of study and work, and, you know, we’re trying to keep on top of it."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,We don’t—we have nothing to do with setting trade policy or negotiating trade agreements.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,We’re supposed to be reacting on behalf of the American economy to support maximum employment and stable prices.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,So that means not overreacting quickly.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"It means not underreacting, too."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Chairman Powell."

2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’re going to be making decisions meeting by meeting as we see this, and, you know, we’ll try to be as transparent as we can as we go."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,We’re not on a preset course.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"I can’t—it’s a challenging time, I admit it, but we really have to be open to all those things."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,So we’ll be looking at all of that and also financial market conditions and how they are affecting the outlook.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"So the difference here is, we have significant, really, risks to that outlook from not just the geopolitical events, but also from slowing global growth and trade policy uncertainty."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, overall, you see an economy that—I think, generally, forecasts show growth similar to our own, forecasts coming in about 2 percent, which is a good, solid year."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"The manufacturing part, less so."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s an unusual situation, because, you know, the U.S. economy itself—the largest part of it, the consumer part of it—is in strong shape."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,So all of those things in principle can affect the achievement of our goals.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’ll be looking for things that are affecting the outlook for the U.S. economy, particularly the outlook as it relates to maximum employment and stable prices."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"With the rate cut today and potentially another modest adjustment coming down the road, do you worry about lessening the Fed’s firepower should there be a recession?"
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Most importantly, we’ll be looking at the performance of the U.S. economy."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Right.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,What’s the Fed’s reaction function now?
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Should they just watch for Jay Powell speeches to decide what’s going to happen going forward?
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Are you reacting to your gut feeling about what trade tweets might mean?
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Are you reacting to data now?
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"On their behalf, let me ask, what is going to guide Fed policy to either pull them towards where the dot plot suggests no more moves this year or keep them in place?"
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Fed funds futures trading since the statement was released shows that investors still think that another rate cut is coming this year.

2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"And so, to some extent, I do believe that our shifting to a more accommodative stance over the course of the year has been one of the reasons why the outlook has remained favorable."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, I would say, the outlook is positive in the face of these crosswinds we’ve felt."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,So that’s really what we’re trying to do.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"So what we are looking for through all of the data, all the events that are going on around the world, we’ll be looking at, you know, the evolving geopolitical events, we’ll be looking at global growth, we’ll be looking at trade policy uncertainty."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,GREG ROBB.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, the way I would characterize it is this: that low rates abroad are a symbol—or a sign, rather, of weak global growth, expectations of low inflation, low growth, and, you know, just kind of a lack of policy space to move against or ideas about how to break out of that low equilibrium."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Greg Robb from MarketWatch.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,I will just say that I continue to believe that the independence of the Federal Reserve from direct political control has served the public well over time.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,I’m not going to change my practice here today of not responding to comments or addressing comments made by elected officials.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,I don’t.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,And any regrets to have this many press conferences?
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Mr. Trump has been a very vocal critic of you and your colleagues, recently calling you “boneheads” and just now has called you a “terrible communicator.” How do you respond to these criticisms?"

2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I—I try to be clear about that, and so—but, ultimately, fiscal—fiscal authorities will do what they seem—deem appropriate."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s a function of other things.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,The potential growth rate of the United States is not a function of monetary policy.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Over the long run, we can’t really affect the growth rate of the United States."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"All of that comes from the private sector, but also from more of the kinds of things that can be done with fiscal policy."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, at a high level, yes, I would say, and I’ve said before, that it’s really fiscal policy that is more powerful and that has much more to do with—fiscal policy can do those things that will increase the longer-run growth rate of the United States by improving productivity and labor force participation and the skills and aptitudes of workers."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"In terms of giving the fiscal authorities—who, by the way, are the ones who created us— advice about how to do their job, you know, we keep that at a high level, I think."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s our real job.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, we try to be clear about that, but, really, I think our job is to use our tools as best we can to achieve—you know, to do the jobs that Congress has assigned us, which is achieve maximum employment and stable prices."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Should you be more explicit about what monetary policy can and cannot do in this environment?
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"As you and your colleagues do this monetary policy framework review, do you ever consider the limitations of monetary policy?"
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Meanwhile, fiscal and regulatory, not to mention trade, policy are pursuing their own separate courses."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"The Fed and your fellow central banks have been sort of exploring the far reaches of what’s possible for monetary policy, even going so far as to make rates negative in some cases, with mixed results."

2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,I have no idea whether that’s what happened at Bank of America.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"I will say about Wells Fargo that, you know, there were quite wide breakdowns in risk management which resulted in, you know, mistreatment of consumers that we know was quite harmful to the consumers and to the image of the institution."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,And I assure you that my colleagues and I will continue to conduct monetary policy without regard to political considerations.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’re going to use our best judgment based on facts, evidence, and objective analysis in pursuing our goals, and that’s what I have to say on it."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,BRIAN CHEUNG.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Chairman Powell."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think we want banks to, you know—to use their liquidity buffers in times of stress rather than pull back from the markets and pull back from serving their clients as a general rule."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you very much.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,We take that into account in setting our interest rate policy.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"We do understand how the—you know, how the international sector interfaces with the U.S. economy."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,And so I think we put all—all of that goes into our thinking and into our models.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"So that’s going to pull down U.S. rates, and U.S. financial conditions can tighten because of that."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, we—in a world where economies and financial markets are tightly integrated, that matters for the U.S. economy."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Now, that has implications for us."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Global capital markets are highly integrated, and, you know, our rates—our long rates are definitely being pulled down by the very, very low rates that are abroad."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Yes, so I guess I would say it this way."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Is there any risk to the U.S. economy to that divergence or any risk to the global economy?
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Mr. Chairman, in your view, is there any risk to the United States having much higher interest rates than Europe and Japan and other parts of the world?"
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,I really don’t have anything for you on that.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Heather Long from the Washington Post."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,So we limit ourselves to high-level statements like that.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"That’s been the case for a long time, and that’s something we will have to address, and a good time to do it is when the economy is strong."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Now, that doesn’t stop us, from time to time, from saying that we think it’s important that the U.S. fiscal picture return to a sustainable footing, and, you know, right now it’s not."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,We take—we take fiscal policy pretty much as exogenous to our work.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, none of that really calls for advice from the Fed."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"That’s really—that’s really Treasury’s job and Congress’s job, in terms of, well, there’s how much to spend, and how big the deficits are, and then there’s how to finance it."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Not really, no."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Is that a conversation that you also have with Treasury Secretary Mnuchin—about what the proper way to maybe address some of the challenges down the road with that type of, kind of, heavy interest globally?"
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mean, does the Fed have concerns over the impacts of a global glut for U.S. debt?"
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"As we saw with falling yields, at least up until the beginning of this month, there’s been a lot of demand for U.S. Treasuries, and even that was partly maybe to blame for the liquidity crunch in repo markets that we saw this week."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks for taking my question.

2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you, Chairman Powell."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, so I saw the headline, like, this morning during all of the preparation and everything and this morning’s meeting."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"I’m wondering if the Fed is also investigating this and, given the pending order against Wells Fargo, if you’re concerned that these banks are too big to manage."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"There are a number—there can be a signal about expectations about growth there for sure, but there can also just be low term premiums."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,So—but why are long-term rates low?
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,So I think what really matters for all financial conditions generally is when there are changes— material changes that are sustained for a period of time.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"The thing—so, just to talk about the current situation, you see—you saw long-term rates move down a whole lot and then retrace two-thirds of that move in the space of a few days."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, again, based on our assessment of all the data, we still think it’s a positive outlook."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,The yield curve is something that we follow carefully.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"We don’t—so, it’s not—there’s no one thing that is dispositive among all financial conditions."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"No, we do—so we monitor the yield curve carefully, along with a large, wide range of financial conditions."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Or where do you— CHAIR POWELL.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,And the inverted yield curve that we hear is the bond market signaling recession—what do you—is that—so that’s not—that signal is not pertinent to you?
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,GREG ROBB.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"But we are adjusting monetary policy in a more accommodative direction to try to support what is, in fact, a favorable outlook."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,We’re not forecasting a recession.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we’re not—as I mentioned, we’re not—we don’t see a recession."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, nonetheless—so the job of monetary policy is to adjust both to ensure against those downside risks, but also to support the economy in light of the existing weakness that we do see."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,So—and you can see some weakness in the U.S. economy because of all that.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Trade policy uncertainty also has—apparently has an effect.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s that global growth will have an effect on U.S. growth over time— less so than for many other economies, but, still, there’s a sector of our economy that’s exposed to that."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"You have downside risks here, and we’ve talked about them."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, the issue is more the risks to that."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I think that’s, by the way, widely shared among forecasters."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, so, I think—and my colleagues and I, I think, all think that the most likely case is for continued moderate growth, continued strong labor market, and inflation moving back up to 2 percent."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"So is the economy over the next year—between now and the end of next year, do you think GDP growth is going to hold steady, and the unemployment rate—could you talk about, just, how do you see the economy evolving over the next year?"
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"And people are—more and more, you talk—there’s talk about recession, so you—and even the Fed thinks the downside risks are rising."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"You’re saying that the economy is doing well, but there’s this sense with people that the economy is actually starting to slow now."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,I’m kind of hearing two things from you.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"For example, just—well, it can just be that there’s this large quantity of negative-yielding and very low-yielding sovereign debt around the world, and, inevitably, that’s exerting downward pressure on U.S. sovereign rates without really necessarily having an independent signal."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Nonetheless, that is a signal about weak global growth, probably, and weak global growth would affect us."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"So global capital markets and the global economy are quite integrated, so this is something we pay careful—we’re not going to be dismissive about the yield curve, but—and I think you can tell, on the Committee, there’s a range of views—there are some who are very focused on the yield curve, others not so much."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, from my perspective, you watch it carefully, and, you know, I think you need to be asking yourself a lot of questions if the yield curve is inverted as to why that is and how long it’s sustained."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s been reported that the CFPB is investigating Bank of America for opening unauthorized accounts.

2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,We feel like we’re doing the best job we can in serving the American people.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,We’re very unified.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"In terms of the morale of the institution, I would say it’s very high."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,The incoming data and the evolving situation and—that’s what’s going to guide our—guide us on that path.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,We’re going to be watching things carefully.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,We don’t know.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I don’t have a specific stopping rule for you, but I think we’re watching carefully, and there will come a time, I suspect, when we think we’ve done enough, but there may also come a time when the economy worsens, and we would then have to cut more aggressively."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"There would be great benefit in having that last as long as possible, that’s all."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"And if you look at sort of the things that are happening in the economy, I think I personally see a high value in sustaining the expansion, because we really are reaching—this positive economy is reaching communities that haven’t been reached in a long time."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’ve moved, really, through the course of this year, as I discussed, and, you know, we see ourselves as taking actions to sustain the expansion and thereby achieve our goals."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,We’re watching the situation.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, our eyes are open."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, I’d love to be able to articulate a simple, straightforward stopping rule, but it’s really just going to be when we think we’ve done enough."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, secondly, as leader of this institution, have you felt a need to take any steps to boost, like, employee morale at a time when the President is constantly criticizing the Fed?"
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, you know, under what circumstances would you say, “You know what, I think we’ve cut enough, we stop now”?"
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"You referred to this as a “midcycle adjustment.” The median dot suggests no more rate cuts, but, you know, if we get continued kind of back-and- forth between the U.S. and China, trade policy uncertainty is going to remain heightened."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,What is your rule for stopping as far as interest rate cuts go?
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"You mentioned trade policy being a complex, ongoing discussion."

2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,So we need to look through what’s a pretty volatile situation.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,VICTORIA GUIDA.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, as I said, we will act as appropriate to sustain the expansion."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we’re going to be looking carefully, meeting by meeting, at the full range of information, and we’re going to assess the appropriate stance of policy as we go."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Sometimes the path ahead is clear and sometimes less so.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,We’re going to be carefully looking at economic data.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,So that’s how we’re going to look at it.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Our decisions are going to depend on the implications of incoming information for the outlook, and I would also say, as we often do, that we’re not on a preset course."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’re going to be highly data dependent, as always."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"We believe that action is appropriate to promote our objectives, of course."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we did—we made one decision today, and that decision was to lower the federal funds rate by ¼ percentage point."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, nonetheless, I’ll respond to your question."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"So the idea of having a bias is something that was a longtime practice, and we don’t actually have that practice anymore, so I can’t really adopt it right here."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Do you still—does the FOMC—is it safe to say the FOMC still has an easing bias or not?
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Taking the statement, your opening remarks, and the SEP, I’m just wondering what kind of message we should take from this."

2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,[Inaudible remark] I’m sorry.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,RICHARD MILLER.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"In other words, as we say in our statement, we will continue to monitor these developments closely, and we will act as appropriate to help ensure that the expansion remains on track."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,We don’t see that—it’s not what we expect—but we would certainly follow that path if it became appropriate.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"And if the economy does turn down, then a more extensive sequence of rate cuts could be appropriate."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"As our statement also highlights, though, there are risks to this positive outlook due particularly to weak global growth and trade developments."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"At the last press conference, I pointed to two episodes in, I guess, 1995 and 1998 as examples of such an approach, which was successful in both of those instances."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"As you can see, FOMC participants generally think that these positive economic outcomes will be achieved with modest adjustments to the federal funds rate."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, by the way, that view is consistent with those of many other forecasters."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, as you can see from our policy statement and from the SEP, we see a favorable economic outlook, with continued moderate growth, a strong labor market, and inflation near our 2 percent objective."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Mr. Chairman, when you cut rates in July, you characterized it as a “midcycle adjustment.” Is that still your view of what’s happening?"
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,RICHARD MILLER.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"If I could just follow up, you’ve also said that the favorable outlook is predicated on financial conditions, and the financial conditions are in turn predicated on an outlook for Fed policy—in this case, further cuts."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Wouldn’t that suggest that you should be inclined to—if you want those financial conditions and that favorable outlook to come about, you should be inclined to cut?"
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,I think applying that principle in a particular situation is where the challenge comes.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think that the idea that if you see trouble approaching on the horizon, you steer away from it if you can—I think that’s a good idea in principle, and I think history teaches us that it’s better to be proactive in adjusting policy if you can."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,So I’ll try to get at that this way.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Yes.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, I wonder, where are your own views about the tension between risk management, which implies some degree of data independence, and this idea of being data dependent?"
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"This is to your own view, because the data is, to some extent, lagged, especially when you have these risks on the horizon, and the markets obviously think that these risks could materialize more than what you and your colleagues are projecting in the dot plot today."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,NICK TIMIRAOS.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"So your question, though, is?"
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I really do think that’s nothing but healthy, and so I see a benefit in having those diverse perspectives, really."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"This is a time of difficult judgments and, as you can see, disparate perspectives."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Sometimes the—and there have been many of those times in my now almost eight years at the Fed, many times when the direction is relatively clear and it’s relatively easy to reach unanimity."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Well, let me just say, on the general point of diverse perspectives, you’re right."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Marty Crutsinger with the Associated Press.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Some people think you need to wait and see the labor market and the consumer crack or weaken further before acting more aggressively, and some people think that by the time that happens, you’ll need to do even more aggressive action to arrest a downturn."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"I know you’re trying to speak for the Committee when you do these press conferences, but the Committee is clearly divided right now, at least about the outlook and the appropriate policy path."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,NICK TIMIRAOS.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’re also going to be watching the U.S. data quite carefully, and we’ll have to make an assessment as we go."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,We’re going to be watching that carefully.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,So we do see those risks as actually more heightened now.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"In any case, they’ve been quite volatile."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Trade developments have been up and down and then up, I guess—or back up, perhaps—over the course of this intermeeting period."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,I think it’s weakened since our last meeting.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’ve seen—you know, if you look at the things we’re monitoring, particularly global growth and trade developments, global growth has continued to weaken."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Well, what we do going forward is very much going to depend, Rich, on the flow of data and information."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Where do you stand on this?
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I told you where the Committee—the bulk of the Committee is going, meeting by meeting, and I think the main takeaway is that this is a Committee that has shifted its policy stance repeatedly, consistently, through the course of the year to support economic activity as it has felt that it’s appropriate."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,MARTIN CRUTSINGER.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"This underscores, for us, the importance of sustaining the expansion so that the strong job market reaches more of those left behind."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,People who live and work in low- and middle-income communities tell us that many who have struggled to find work are now getting opportunities to add new and better chapters to their lives.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"And wages have been rising, particularly for lower-paying jobs."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Participation in the labor force by people in their prime working years has been increasing.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"The pace of job gains has eased this year, but we had expected some slowing after last year’s strong pace."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"The unemployment rate has been near half-century lows for a year and a half, and job gains have remained solid in recent months."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,The job market remains strong.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"As seen from FOMC participants’ most recent projections, the median expectation for real GDP growth remains near 2 percent this year and next before edging down toward its estimated longer-run value."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Even so, with household spending remaining on a solid footing and with supportive financial conditions, we expect the economy to continue to expand at a moderate rate."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Business fixed investment posted a modest decline in the second quarter, and recent indicators point to continued softness."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Our business contacts around the country have been telling us that uncertainty about trade policy has discouraged them from investing in their businesses.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Trade policy tensions have waxed and waned, and elevated uncertainty is weighing on U.S. investment and exports."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Additionally, a number of geopolitical risks, including Brexit, remain unresolved."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Since the middle of last year, the global growth outlook has weakened, notably in Europe and China."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,The main reasons appear to be slower growth abroad and trade policy developments—two sources of uncertainty that we’ve been monitoring all year.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"In contrast, business investment and exports have weakened amid falling manufacturing output."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Household spending—supported by a strong job market, rising incomes, and solid consumer confidence—has been the key driver of growth."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,The economy grew at a 2½ percent pace in the first half of the year.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"We are into the 11th year of this economic expansion, and the baseline outlook remains favorable."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,The U.S. economy has continued to perform well.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"As I will explain shortly, we took this step to help keep the U.S. economy strong in the face of some notable developments and to provide insurance against ongoing risks."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Today we decided to lower interest rates.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,We are committed to making the best decisions we can based on facts and objective analysis.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,We do this by steadfastly pursuing the goals Congress has given us: maximum employment and stable prices.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Transcript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference September 18, 2019 CHAIR POWELL."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Just—just to follow up, I mean, in terms of tweaks to the LCR, I mean, there’s also been some talk about potentially giving banks some room in times of stress to maybe dip into their liquidity buffers."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,We expect the job market to remain strong.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,The median of participants’ projections for the unemployment rate remains below 4 percent over the next several years.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Inflation continues to run below our symmetric 2 percent objective.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Over the 12 months through July, total PCE inflation was 1.4 percent and core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, was 1.6 percent."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"As the Committee contemplates the future path of the target range for the federal funds rate, it will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook and will act as appropriate to sustain the expansion, with a strong labor market and inflation near its symmetric 2 percent objective."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"To summarize, we are fully committed to pursuing our goals of maximum employment and stable prices."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Consistent with our decision earlier this year to continue to implement monetary policy in an ample-reserves regime, we will, over time, provide a sufficient supply of reserves so that frequent operations are not required."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,We will continue to monitor market developments and will conduct operations as necessary to foster trading in the federal funds market at rates within the target range.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"In a related action, we also adjusted the rate on the overnight repurchase facility to 5 basis points below the bottom of the target range."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"In addition, as we have done in the past, we made a technical adjustment to the interest rate paid on required and excess reserve balances, setting it 20 basis points below the top of the target range for the federal funds rate."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"These temporary operations were effective in relieving funding pressures, and we expect the federal funds rate to move back into the target range."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"To counter these pressures, we conducted overnight repurchase operations yesterday and again today."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,This upward pressure emerged as funds flowed from the private sector to the Treasury to meet corporate tax payments and settle purchases of Treasury securities.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"While these issues are important for market functioning and market participants, they have no implications for the economy or the stance of monetary policy."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Funding pressures in money markets were elevated this week, and the effective federal funds rate rose above the top of its target range yesterday."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Let me say a few words about our monetary policy operations.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Of course, those views are merely forecasts and, as always, will evolve with the arrival of new information."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,I’ll be happy to take your questions.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,The projections of appropriate policy show that participants generally anticipate only modest changes in the federal funds rate over the next couple of years.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"We have often said that policy is not on a preset course, and that is certainly the case today."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,The future course of monetary policy will depend on how the economy evolves and what developments imply for the economic outlook and risks to the outlook.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"The Fed has no role in the formulation of trade policy, but we do take into account anything that could materially affect the economy relative to our employment and inflation goals."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Since our last meeting, we have seen additional signs of weakness abroad and a resurgence of trade policy tensions, including the imposition of additional tariffs."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Today’s decision to lower the federal funds rate target by ¼ percent, to 1.75 percent to 2 percent, is appropriate in light of the global developments I mentioned as well as muted inflation pressures."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Of course, this is the role of monetary policy—to adjust interest rates to maintain a strong labor market and keep inflation near our 2 percent objective."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"These factors, in conjunction with muted inflation pressures, have led us to shift our views about appropriate monetary policy over time toward a lower path for the federal funds rate, and this shift has supported the outlook."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"As I mentioned, weakness in global growth and trade policy uncertainty have weighed on the economy and pose ongoing risks."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"While this has been our outlook for quite some time, our views about the path of interest rates that will best achieve these outcomes have changed significantly over the past year."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,objective as most likely.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Overall, as we say in our postmeeting statement, we continue to see sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near our symmetric 2 percent 1 Chair Powell intended to say that the median projection is 1.9 percent next year."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,We are mindful that continued below-target inflation could lead to an unwelcome downward slide in longer-term inflation expectations.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"We still expect inflation to rise to 2 percent; the median projection is 1.9 percent this year and 2 percent in 2021.1 However, inflation pressures clearly remain muted, and indicators of longer-term inflation expectations are at the lower end of their historical ranges."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"As I have noted, the baseline economic outlook remains positive."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"At the beginning of the year we were looking at further rate increases, then we were patient, and then we cut once, then we cut again."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,My colleagues at the Federal Reserve and I are dedicated to serving the American people.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think—but it will continue to be data dependent, and depend—data includes the evolving risk picture."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"But just to follow up, if I could."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,HOWARD SCHNEIDER.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think I’d be very reluctant to look at it as hardened views or a prediction, really."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"It should give you a sense of how people are thinking about the likely path of the economy and the appropriate path for monetary policy in that individual person’s thinking, and I think that’s a good thing to know."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Particularly, if you look at 2020, I think the use of this is, individual participants write down their forecasts."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Fair enough, but if— CHAIR POWELL."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,HOWARD SCHNEIDER.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"But even then, knowing where the—knowing what the data will say and the way geopolitical events and other events are going to evolve in the next 90 days and the implications of that for the economy, I would say there’s a lot of uncertainty around that."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think the closer you get to the current day, the more confidence you can have."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, honestly, I think it’s hard to have hardened expectations about where rate policy is going to be a year from now."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Well, the fact that this—the fed funds rate is now seen as not moving through 2020 suggests to me that these opinions are pretty—pretty well anchored right now in those groups."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,HOWARD SCHNEIDER.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,And you’re asking specifically about 2020?
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I wondered, is it fair to say that the—those opinions have become sort of firmer in their conviction, and that it’s going to take some sort of real material change in the outlook now for that to move in either direction?"
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"I was struck by the sort of anchored median federal funds rate here through 2020, and that in comparison to the fact that you now have sort of three very discrete groups of opinions around where the fed funds rate is heading."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Howard Schneider with Reuters."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,HOWARD SCHNEIDER.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"You see it in weak business investment, weak exports—hard to quantify it precisely, though."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, I mean, I think if you take a step back from that, we do feel that trade uncertainty is having an effect."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s also consistent with what we’ve been hearing in the Beige Book.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"So—and this piece of research found significant effects, and that’s frankly consistent with a number of other research projects that economists have undertaken."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"To try to isolate the effects of certain things is very challenging, but we do the best we can."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s a $22 trillion economy.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"And while I would say, directly answering your question, there’s real uncertainty around these— around these effects."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, what this particular piece of work did is, it went after measuring trade policy uncertainty through a couple of channels, including concerning tariffs, also concerning the threat of more tariffs, and it looked deeply at the data to try to assess the effects on output."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,There were a number of arguments in July around the reason for cutting rates.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Have any of those gotten substantially weaker or changed around the table?
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"In terms of the net stable funding ratio, it’s—I believe we put it out for comment and got comments, and I believe we’re looking at—at finalizing that in the relatively near future."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I think you’ve seen us being willing to move based on data, based on the evolving risk picture, and I have no reason to think that will change."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"On the other hand, it might be that more reserves are needed, in which case we are in a position to supply them."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, so I think if we concluded that we needed to raise the level of required reserves for banks to meet the LCR, we’d probably raise the level of reserves rather than lower the LCR."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Are you all still planning on putting that out soon?
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, also, what is the status of the net stable funding ratio rule?"
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Are you all looking at whether, you know, some tweaks to the liquidity coverage ratio might help?"
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, banks have been pointing to liquidity rules as having contributed to some of the volatility we’ve seen in repo markets and, you know, potentially some capital rules as well."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Another money market question.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Victoria Guida with Politico.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,VICTORIA GUIDA.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,And I think we’ll learn quite a lot in the next six weeks.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"And the question will be, then—as we go through quarter-end, as we learn more, you know, what really—how much of this really has to do with the level of reserves?"
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,So it’s a great tradition that we have.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,That will be the tool that we use.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, I think it’s hard to deal with every hypothetical possibility."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,And is that a possibility the Committee would consider?
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"I guess the question is, if you have shrunk your balance sheet maybe just a little bit too small to the point that reserves are too scarce to get through sort of these unusual periods, is organic growth in the balance sheet enough to get back to a point of ample reserves that can get us through those tough times, or would you need to see something a little bit above that?"
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"You talked about the Committee thinking about resuming organic growth, you know, over time."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,I’m just curious on your balance sheet point.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Jeanna Smialek with the New York Times.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Chair Powell."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,JEANNA SMIALEK.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"So that’s why I think what’s—that’s what’s happened over the intermeeting period, and, you know, different people around the table have different perspectives as you obviously know."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think if you look at—the global economy, I think, has weakened further in the EU and China, and I think, you know, trade policy developments have been a big mover of markets and of sentiment during that intermeeting period."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"The labor market is still strong, though, so generally that is the same."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, well, I think, if you look at the U.S.—look at the U.S. economy, the U.S. economy has generally performed roughly as expected—roughly: The consumer is spending at a healthy clip, I’d say business fixed investment and exports have weakened further, and I’d say the manufacturing PMI suggests more weakness ahead."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think, for the foreseeable future, we’re going to be looking at, if needed, doing the sorts of things that we did the last two days—these temporary open market operations."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s just—and, by the way, they put it out for public review so that you can see their econometrics, so you can see all of it— their whole work is exposed to critique by the whole profession."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mean, it’s not impossible that we would come to a view that the LCR is calibrated too high, but that’s not something that we think right now."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s their research.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"If we experience another episode of pressures in money markets, we have the tools to address those pressures."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"We took appropriate actions to address those pressures, to keep the fed funds rate within the target range, and those measures were successful."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"The strains in the money markets reflect forces that we saw coming, and they just had a bigger effect than I think most folks anticipated—strong demand for cash to purchase Treasuries and pay corporate taxes."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, as I mentioned, it doesn’t—we don’t see this as having any implications for the broader economy or for the economic outlook, nor for our ability to control rates."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Why don’t I do that?
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,I can go on a little bit about how we’re looking at that.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, no, I’m not concerned about that, to answer your question."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"It wasn’t a surprise, but it was—it was a stronger response than—certainly than we expected."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, people were writing about this and publishing stories about it weeks ago."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, by the way, our sense is that it surprised market participants a lot, too."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,But we didn’t expect—the response to that was stronger than we expected.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s not an official finding of the Federal Reserve Board or the Federal Reserve System.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, of course, we were well aware of the—you know, the tax payments and also of the settlement of the large bond purchases."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, so I would say I doubt that anyone is closer to and has more invested in carefully following the—you know, the behavior of these markets."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Are you concerned about how, for example, the New York Fed operated through this?"
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Was the Fed listening to markets well ahead of time, going back a year when there were blowouts in the overnight rate at year-end and the turn of the year?"
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Tuesday came along, and there wasn’t an operation until nine o’clock and no announcement until—of a second operation until four o’clock in the afternoon."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,You closed Monday at the top end of the fed funds rate.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,There were several reports of people pointing to September as a potential crunch time.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,We talked to many traders who said the tax date payment was known well in advance.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,I wonder if you’re concerned about how the Federal Reserve operated through the recent liquidity crunch in markets.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,I’ve only done this a dozen—a lot of times.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Steve Liesman, CNBC."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Mr. Chairman, I wonder if you’re—oh, sorry."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"That’s where I am, and that’s where I think the bulk of the Committee is."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,STEVE LIESMAN.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,We will not hesitate to use them.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"And since we’re talking about this, let me take a step back and say this."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, we were very much waiting for that."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,And we’ve been operating in that regime for a full decade.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s generally of very high quality.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Earlier in the year, as you will all recall, after careful study over a period of years, actually, the Committee announced the decision to implement monetary policy in an ample-reserves regime."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Yes.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"And if you have confidence in that paper, it would seem to suggest a—sort of a more aggressively dovish path than the one that you’ve chosen."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,How much confidence do you have in the Fed’s ability to estimate the real effects of trade uncertainty?
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,And it suggested that it could drag through the business investment channel on growth as much as a percentage point over the course of the next year.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Earlier this year— or, actually, in September, the Governors’ Board put out a research paper looking—trying to quantify trade uncertainty."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Brendan Greeley with the Financial Times.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,BRENDAN GREELEY.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Again, we’ll be looking at this carefully in coming days and taking it up at the next meeting."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"That’s always been a possibility, and it certainly is now."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, yes, there’s real uncertainty, and it is certainly possible that we will need to resume the organic growth of the balance sheet earlier than we thought."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,We put it out so the public can react to it.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I think to provide a little context, Fed economists do research all the time."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,We try to assess what that is.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,We’ve tried to combine all of that together.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,The main hallmark of that regime is that we use adjustments in our administered rates—the IOER and RRP rates—to keep the fed fund rates in the target range.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s designed specifically so that we do not expect to be conducting frequent open market operations for that purpose.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, going forward, we’re going to be very closely monitoring market developments and assessing their implications for the appropriate level of reserves, and we’re going to be assessing, you know, the question of when it will be appropriate to resume the organic growth of our balance sheet."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,And I’m sure we’ll be revisiting that question during this intermeeting period and certainly at our next meeting.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,STEVE LIESMAN.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,We think it works well to implement our rate decisions.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Do you think you’ve underestimated the amount of reserves necessary for the banking system?
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we’ve always said that it’s—that the level is uncertain, right?"
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,And that’s something we’ve tried to be very clear about.
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"And as you know, we’ve invested lots of time talking to many of the large holders of reserves to assess their—what they say is their demand for reserves."
2019-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Could I just follow up here quickly?
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"You can see that we had our usual range of perspectives, range of views."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, in the end, we had a strong vote in favor of this action."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,I strongly believe it’s the right action.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,I strongly believe that the actions we’ve taken over the course of this year have been the right things to do for this economy and are supporting economic growth and will do so in the future.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,So— GREG ROBB.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,Greg Robb from MarketWatch.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"Chairman Powell, it seems that the differences all across the country—that different regions are reacting differently to the China trade, and some regions are much weaker than others."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"There’s this urban versus rural divide, the coasts versus the middle of the country."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,How does that factor into your policy decisions?
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,I think this seems to be the right movement.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,Yes.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,But that’s our outlook.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"Chair Powell, setting aside market expectations for today’s rate cut—obviously, 97 percent sort of expected that this would happen today—can you tell us a little bit more about the rationale behind moving at this particular meeting as opposed to waiting six weeks and cutting in December, and if there was any discussion about that around the table?"
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,Donna Borak with CNN.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,DONNA BORAK.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,And we feel like our current stance of policy is appropriate as long as that remains broadly our outlook.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, it’s—you never say you’ve achieved it."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"That’s our outlook: could be better, could be worse."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"So that is—our outlook overall is for moderate growth of around 2 percent, which is pretty close to trend."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"When you look at that, do you believe that you have achieved a soft landing or are achieving a soft landing, in the sense that we’re moving to trend growth for the rest of the year and next year?"
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,You mentioned housing and today’s GDP data.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,Steve Matthews with Bloomberg.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, it’s—monetary policy is famously a blunt instrument."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"I would just—I noted that it may be that there’s been progress there toward— away from bad outcomes and confrontational outcomes, and it seems like there’s the makings of a possible settlement there."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,But we’re very conscious.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"I didn’t say we’re baking that in or anything, but I’m just noting that that’s the case."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"Yes, I know, that’s—I wouldn’t—that’s not how I would characterize it."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, given the ups and downs of the trade dispute and that, you know, several truces and tentative deals have fallen through, are you concerned about developing monetary policy guidance, if you will, that’s dependent a good part on the wins of the trade negotiations?"
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think you said, Chair Powell, that the primary positive development in risks to the outlook was on trade and, specifically, the prospects for a phase-one agreement with China."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,Don Lee with the L.A. Times.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,DON LEE.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"Really, it’s fiscal policy that supports, you know, inclusive growth."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, really, it isn’t monetary policy."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"But if you really want the U.S. economy to be all it can be and raise the potential growth rate of the United States, you need—you need proper monetary policy."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"And those are issues for Congress, and they’re not issues for us."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"The U.S. economy faces significant longer-term challenges around potential growth, around labor force participation, around disparities of income and wealth, around all kinds of things."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,We do bank regulation.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,We do financial stability.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"Let me put it this way: We do what we do, which is, we’re assigned a job, which is maximum employment and stable prices."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,I sometimes have noted that it would be appropriate.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,I’m not asking Congress to do anything right now.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"Just, so—so are you asking Congress to do something now, or will you ask them to do something down the road?"
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,Could—sorry.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"Sorry, could I follow?"
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"Oh, could I follow?"
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,GREG ROBB.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"We don’t really have, you know, the tools to address that, but we call things out that are important to our economy that we may not be—that we might have—may not have the right tools to best address them, but we call them out because, you know, we’re spending all of our time with the economy, and those are issues that maybe have to be addressed by legislatures and, you know, by—at the national level and at the state level."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, it’s a big and growing difference—set of differences."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"The sort of rural–urban disparities in—you know, in employment, in growth, in all kinds of things, in health outcomes."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"The first thing to know is to understand that, that—and we’ve called that out, as you, I’m sure, know, in one of our recent Monetary Policy Reports to Congress."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we can’t—obviously, we can’t raise interest rates some place and lower them other places."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,STEVE MATTHEWS.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I think, more broadly, monetary policy is also supporting household spending and home buying by keeping the labor market strong, keeping workers’ incomes rising, and keeping consumer confidence at high levels, where it currently is."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"That’s why we—you know, we talk about how low the unemployment rate is, the aggregate unemployment, but we also talk about groups that haven’t experienced that yet."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"We also see now, I think, more clearly the effects of more accommodative monetary policy on various kinds of consumer activity."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s all—the data we monitor, obviously, is a very broad range of data."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"Again, low initial claims."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,What we see is—what we see is that the consumer sector continues strong.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, we don’t see any evidence of that."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"This is kind of a one-legged recovery, that unless you get some impetus from other things—exports, investment—that it’s going to weaken further at some point?"
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"But are you concerned—just to follow up, really."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,HOWARD SCHNEIDER.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"That is, we believe, an accommodative level and a level that will support that outlook that we have."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"That continues, but nonetheless, overall, we’ve got an economy that is showing moderate growth, and we think that today’s setting—we’re now at 1.5 to 1.75 percent."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"We know that the manufacturing, investment, trade, export sector has been weak."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"And it’s just—again, all the things I went through earlier suggest that that sector continues to be strong."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,Witness today’s GDP report.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"Again, if you look at the performance of the economy through this, the consumer sector has been quite resilient."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s really both of those things.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s really the whole range of economic data and also what we see as—about our stance of policy, which we believe is the appropriate stance."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"Honestly, it’s really the—there isn’t any one factor."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"Or is it something different, you know, in the financial markets, the fact that the yield curve has righted itself, et cetera?"
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,Is it the fact that the risk environment out there globally has shifted a bit and abated a bit?
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"Is it the response you’re seeing in housing and other parts of the economy, arguably, to the cuts made so far?"
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"I wonder if you could give us a little more texture on, sort of, what the strongest or most important case is for feeling that you’ve now taken out adequate insurance."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"Howard Schneider with Reuters, and thanks for the questions."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,HOWARD SCHNEIDER.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,As with Brexit—it’s still quite uncertain what will be the result of the election and what the ultimate result will be.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"Those are not things that can happen that can really address the situation in the short term, but those are a range of things that we’re looking at as well."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,You’re seeing strong durable goods sales.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,And so we’re—we try to remind ourselves that we serve everybody.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"You’re seeing housing now contributing to growth for the first time in a while—two-tenths, I think, this quarter."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,So that’s good.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"And so we’re—we’re very conscious of—you know, that we represent all Americans, and we need to hear all of their perspectives."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,We also meet quite regularly at the Board with representatives of low- and moderate- income communities.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, by the way, all of those groups are also represented on the boards of our regional banks."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"I would say this: In the Beige Book, we talk to educational institutions, health-care institutions, community groups, labor groups—it’s not just businesses."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"In fact, I would imagine that this entire monetary policy review will become institutionalized and be done every few years."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"We think—we think that Fed Listens has been a great success for us, and I’m sure we will repeat it."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"Has there been thought of bringing in folks, say, from community groups more regularly?"
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,Has the Fed thought about institutionalizing something like Fed Listens and maybe taking in some of this input from people that you don’t always hear from—things like the Beige Book focus on businesses?
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"You mentioned Fed Listens a couple of times, and what you’ve heard from people there about how it’s benefited the disadvantaged or lower-income workers—the hot job market we have."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,Chris Rugaber at Associated Press.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,CHRIS RUGABER.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, again, resolution of our trade issues would contribute to that over time as well."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,And that should turn—that should support growth in the global economy.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"Not here, but perhaps elsewhere."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, there’s a lot of monetary policy accommodation and some fiscal accommodation, maybe, in the global economy now."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I think, you know, what one would like to see for—to support greater manufacturing activity, business investment, and exports would be a global recovery."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think it’s—I think interest rates are a factor in business investment, but I don’t believe they’re the main factor and main driver."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think the effects are clear in what we think of as the interest-rate-sensitive sectors, which are the ones—some of the ones that I mentioned."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"Well, I think monetary policy works through the channels that we understand."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"Is there a concern that there’s just less potency on the business investment side that you’re, in effect, pushing on a string?"
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,You were just talking about how the lower rates have affected consumer behavior.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,SCOTT HORSLEY.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"And you’re seeing retail sales—the retail sales number, the PCE number, as I mentioned, in today’s release was 2.9 percent."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"But I would say that the tail risk of a nonnegotiated no-deal Brexit seems to have decreased, just as I would say that the situation in our trade negotiations with China seems to have taken a step closer to resolution."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"Leverage among corporations and other forms of business, private businesses, is historically high."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,DON LEE.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,Do you think so?
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"So do you think a Japan-like situation, or “Japanification” of chronically low inflation and interest rates—the U.S. is getting trapped by the Japanification of this situation?"
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"Given this sustained level of low inflation, even in—even in this country, do you think—so there seems to be a higher possibility that lower inflation expectations will remain going forward."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"Naoatsu Aoyama from the Asahi Shimbun, a Japanese newspaper."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you very much, Chairman Powell."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,NAOATSU AOYAMA.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"And those are things we would do, but only if we can do it without compromising safety or soundness or financial stability."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"Also, there are just a few technical things that we can look at that would perhaps make the liquidity that we have—which we think is ample in the financial system—move more freely and be more liquid, if you will."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"It used to be a common thing for banks to have intraday liquidity from the Fed, what are called “daylight overdrafts.” That’s something we can look at."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think where it may go, though, is to look at, for example, intraday liquidity, which used to be a common thing."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,I don’t think that’s where this goes.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,I don’t think so.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"You ask, would we lower capital and liquidity requirements because of this?"
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"And so, we’re doing careful analysis of that."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,So why is that?
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,That didn’t happen.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"They were well above that, and yet they didn’t deploy that liquidity when there seemed to be great opportunities to do that."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"In addition to that—in addition to that, we’re looking at—there are—it’s a big, complicated marketplace, and there was the—one of the surprises, as I mentioned, was that banks that had told us that their lowest comfortable level of reserves was here."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we’re on a path to do that, between our temporary open market operations and also our bill purchases."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"That’s the main thing, that’s the first thing."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"We don’t want them to move below the level they were at in the beginning of September, which is, again, between $1.45 and $1.5 trillion."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we’re—I think, again, I think the most important basic thing is to get the level of reserves back up so that—reserves move up and down with some volatility."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,Is that something that the Fed might review?
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,Have the problems in the repo market led you to look into whether the liquidity and capital requirements for banks are too high?
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,Nancy Marshall-Genzer with Marketplace.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,Hi.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we—we, of course, have watched the situation in Japan and now the situation in Europe, and we—we note that there are significant disinflationary pressures around the world."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, of course, if you look at our current inflation performance, it hasn’t been anything like what we’ve seen in those other places."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks very much.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,And are there things that we can do that would—adjustments that we could make that would allow liquidity to flow more easily in the system without in any way sacrificing safety and soundness or financial stability?
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"Okay, thank you."

2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, I’m going to maintain my longtime practice of not—not commenting on anything any elected official would say, but thank you."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"I just wondered, as the Chair of America’s central bank, what you made of that characterization."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"Chairman Powell, this morning, the President tweeted that we’re seeing the greatest economy in American history."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,VIVIENNE NUNIS.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"The question of the longer-run maturity composition of the balance sheet is a—is a big one, and it’s one we’ll return to over time, but not—not imminently."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, it’s a—it’s an issue, but it’s not an issue that we’re currently working on and—or reaching a decision on or anything like that."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"I’m just wondering if the Fed is actively thinking about that right now, and, if so, when we might expect to hear something on that."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,Not any—I haven’t really heard an update on the composure or the composition of the balance sheet for right now.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"Another type of balance sheet question, but not necessarily focused on the repo crunch—there was a discussion before that, that maybe we should move—or, rather, the Fed should move to a more neutral balance sheet, trying to remove some of the agency mortgage-backed securities that are on the balance sheet and maybe replace them with shorter-term Treasuries."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,Brian Cheung with Yahoo Finance.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,Hi.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,BRIAN CHEUNG.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, we think that the right thing to do is to do what we can now to hold and really move inflation expectations up so that they’re squarely and firmly anchored at a level that’s consistent with 2 percent inflation."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"You have less—interest rates move down as well, because there’s an inflation component in interest rates."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"Once inflation expectations start sliding down, inflation moves down."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"The risk is that what we’ve seen is other economies getting on a disinflationary path, that it’s been very hard for them to get off."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s not—the risk isn’t that inflation might run a couple tenths below 2 percent.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,So we take—we take the risk very seriously.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"That’s what we’re committed to, and we’ll use our tools to achieve."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"But we don’t think—again, we don’t think we’re exempt from those pressures, and we are, therefore, strongly committed to having inflation expectations anchored at the level that is consistent with the symmetric 2 percent inflation objective."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,And we don’t think we’re exempt from those.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"And it’s been part of the last couple of Shared National Credit exams, and we’ve been monitoring it carefully and taking appropriate action."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"So that’s what I would say, but it’s—corporate debt is one part of a larger part of our framework, and it is something that we’re paying quite a bit of attention to."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,We’ve been monitoring it carefully and taking appropriate steps.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, given your mention of fiscal policy and the role it plays in supporting long-term growth, you know, is it fair to say that the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act worked the way it was supposed to?"
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"Secondly, you know, we’re now two years removed from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and the economy is growing at about the same pace it was before—2 percent."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"Wondering if you would categorize the current stance of monetary policy as accommodative, or if it’s just, you know, that neutral was lower than we thought at this time last year."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you—thank you, Chairman."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,Paul Kiernan from Dow Jones Newswires.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"[Inaudible] Oh, I was wondering what that was."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,Paul Kiernan from Dow Jones Newswires.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you, Chairman."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,PAUL KIERNAN.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s a little bit far afield from our task here.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,But I’m not going to comment on what the appropriate labor arrangements are.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,And I think it’s good to see it settled.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"That’s likely to come back, maybe, over the first half of next year."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"I will just say, on the General Motors strike, it’s—it’s likely to have taken away a couple of tenths of growth this quarter."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, not for us to say what the appropriate labor arrangements will be."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"In light of the recent outcome of the strike at General Motors, do you see the union having a role to play, helping to raise lower and middle incomes and promoting more shared growth in the long run?"
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,The Fed has pointed out many times in the past the rising inequality over those past decades and how that could be a factor behind sluggish growth.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,Virginie Montet with the Agence France-Presse.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,VIRGINIE MONTET.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"And if we see—if we have—if we—if things happen that cause us to materially reassess the outlook, change our assessment of the outlook in a material way, then we would act accordingly."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"That’s one factor among many, many factors that factor into our assessment of the outlook."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"If I could follow up, if the phase-one agreement, then, doesn’t work out, then would we be back at, you know, making, you know, monetary policy that— CHAIR POWELL."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"Sorry, say again what your first question was?"
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"I wrote it down, I can’t— PAUL KIERNAN."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,Sorry—if policy is accommodative right now.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"That leaves businesses, which is where the issue has been."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"Obviously, plenty of households are not in great shape financially, but in the aggregate, the household sector is in a very good place."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,We see them actually getting in very good shape financially in the aggregate.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"So with households, again, we don’t see leverage."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"And that leaves the fourth, which is leverage in the nonfinancial sector, and that’s households and businesses."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,We don’t see bubbles and that kind of thing.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"If you look at asset prices, we see some high asset prices but not broadly across a range."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"The second is funding risk, which is the risk of runnable funding, and that risk is also quite low for banks but also for, you know, the nonbanking financial sector."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"The first is leverage in the financial system, which is low by historical standards."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we have a four-part framework, I’ll quickly mention."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,This long expansion is notable for the lack of large financial imbalances like the ones we’ve seen certainly before the crisis happened.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"Currently, we don’t see large imbalances."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s what we do since the financial crisis, as I’ve mentioned before."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s all I’m saying.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,So we monitor financial stability risks very carefully all of the time.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"So as rates get lower in the U.S. and around the world, are you more worried about financial stability risks and reach-for-yield?"
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"Recently, the IMF and some other global policymakers have been expressing concerns over the high level of risky corporate debt."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,I wanted to ask about financial stability risks.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,Jean Yung from Market News.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,Hi.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,So— JEAN YUNG.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, nonetheless, that seems to me to be very likely to be an accommodative stance of policy, and an appropriate stance, given the situation we’re in with continuing downside risks and—that I mentioned."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"I would say, though, that there’s a range of plausible estimates of what the neutral rate of interest is, and I think many of those who make such estimates have moved their estimate down over the course of many years, and that process continues."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,I think my own sense would be that that’s somewhat accommodative policy.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,So that means the real rate is probably modestly below zero.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"So if you look at where the federal funds rate is trading, it should be in the middle of, or maybe the lower half of, the range of 150 to 175."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,Okay.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"Ah, yes."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"They just—they didn’t do that, and so the question is why."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,So we’re looking at those.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,There are also—it may be—one thing that was surprising about the episode was that liquidity didn’t seem to flow as one might have expected.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,And it was broad across equipment and other parts of—all parts of business fixed investment were weak.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"Business investment has been weak, and today’s reading was weak as well."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"You asked about business investment, and that’s right."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think on both situations there’s plenty of risk left, but I’d have to say that the risks seem to have subsided."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"Brexit, I would say, as well—it appears that the risk of a no-deal Brexit seems to have materially declined."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,So that has the potential for being an improvement in the risk picture.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"We have that phase-one potential agreement with China, which, if signed and put into effect, could have the effect of reducing trade tensions and reducing uncertainty, and that would bode well, we think, for business confidence and perhaps activity over time."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,So I was really referring there to trade developments.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, in terms of risks, what I was referring to there—the principal risks that we’ve been monitoring have been, really, slowing global growth and trade policy developments as well as muted inflation pressure."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"This morning we obviously learned that we’ve now had two quarters of contracting business investment, which would seem to be moving the outlook in the other direction."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"I’m wondering if you could specify—is that on trade, or are there other matters?"
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,You just said that the risks to the outlook are moving in a positive direction.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Heather Long from the Washington Post."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,HEATHER LONG.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"If something happens to cause us to materially reassess that outlook, that’s what would cause us to change our views on the appropriate stance of policy."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s for moderate growth, a strong labor market, and inflation near our 2 percent objective."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’ll be looking at a full range of data about the economy and about the risks to the outlook, and I’ve given you a sense of what our outlook is."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"If I could follow up—if the markets decide that you need to cut rates again, will you be forced to follow?"
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHAEL MCKEE.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,But that’s what it would take: a material reassessment of our outlook.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"So you asked what it would take, you know, to move, and, as I mentioned, we’re going to be watching all factors, And if developments emerge that cause a material reassessment of our outlook, we would respond accordingly."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,We feel that policy is well positioned to support the outlook that I described.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"Turning to policy, we’ve moved the stance of policy over the course of the year to a more accommodative stance, and, after the cuts at the last three meetings, the federal funds rate is now in a range between 1½ and 1¾ percent."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,So that’s the economy.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"We also see the risks to the outlook as perhaps having moved in a positive direction over the course of this intermeeting period, although, some remain—some things remain to be seen."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"That’s consistent with what we’ve seen, but that’s the economy we’ve had this year."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,We see the outlook as for more of the same.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"What we’ve had is an economy where the consumer is really driving growth, and, you know, personal consumption expenditures were almost 3 percent in this quarter—in this first reading for the quarter."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,HEATHER LONG.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,But it seems to be settling in below 2 percent.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"That turns out to have been the case, so it’s moved back up."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"We thought that that was due, to some extent, to idiosyncratic or transient factors."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,Inflation moved down in the first quarter of this year.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"So the reason why we raised interest rates is because—generally is because we see inflation as moving up—or, in danger of moving up significantly, and we really don’t see that now."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,What would make you guys decide it’s appropriate to raise interest rates again?
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,And I guess I’m just curious what the onus is for doing that in this cycle.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,They raised rates again fairly quickly.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"So you’ve previously sort of compared this rate-cutting cycle to the insurance cuts in the ’90s, and in both of those instances, the Greenspan Fed took those cuts back after a while."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks for taking our questions.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,Jeanna Smialek from the New York Times.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,JEANNA SMIALEK.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"So that is the thing that’s pushing the economy forward, and it doesn’t seem to have been affected so far by weakness in the other areas."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"The consumer-facing companies that we talk to in our vast network of contacts report, you know, that consumers are doing well and are focused on, you know, the good job market and rising incomes, and that’s their principle focus."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,So it’s very positive.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"Unemployment has declined again, and the household survey is now at a 50-year low—has been, you know, very close to 50-year lows for 18 months now."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,What we continue to see is good job creation.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"But the risk you mention of the weakness in the manufacturing—in export investment, business investment, parts of the economy getting into the consumer side of the economy, we really don’t see that."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,We don’t see rising initial claims or layoffs or anything like that.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"That’s a risk that we’ve been monitoring, but we don’t see it yet."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"Yes, so that is a risk."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,Can you give a sense of how the Committee is thinking—thinking through that possibility?
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, sort of, if they continue to be concerned."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mean, there’s this concern that I sometimes hear that, with business, businesses have cut investment, and are they going to turn around and cut employment?"
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,Can I just follow up quickly?
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, overall, we see the economy as having been resilient to the—you know, the winds that have been blowing this year."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,So we really don’t see that risk.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, overall, we’ve seen moderate growth, a strong labor market, inflation moving up."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"So what we’ve said, to repeat, is that we see the current stance of policy as “likely to remain appropriate as long as incoming information about the economy remains broadly consistent with our outlook.” And we say that, really, because both of the performance of the economy and the stance of policy."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"However, against the backdrop of a strong economy and supportive monetary policy, we expect inflation will rise to 2 percent."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,We’re mindful that continued below-target inflation could lead to an unwelcome downward slide in long-term inflation expectations.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"Inflation pressures remain muted, and indicators of longer-term inflation expectations are at the lower end of their historic ranges."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"Over the 12 months through August, total PCE inflation was 1.4 percent and core inflation was 1.8 percent."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,Inflation continues to run below our symmetric 2 percent objective.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,This underscores for us the importance of sustaining the expansion so that the strong job market reaches more of those left behind.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,People who live and work in low- and middle-income communities tell us that many who have struggled to find work are now getting opportunities to add new and better chapters to their lives.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"Participation in the labor force by people in their prime working years has been increasing, and wages have been rising, particularly for lower-paying jobs."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,The pace of job gains has eased this year but has remained solid; we had expected some slowing after last year’s strong pace.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,The unemployment rate has been near half-century lows for a year and a half.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,The job market remains strong.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"Looking ahead, we continue to expect the economy to expand at a moderate rate, reflecting solid household spending and supportive financial conditions."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,Sluggish growth abroad and trade developments have been weighing on those sectors.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"In contrast, business investment and exports remain weak, and manufacturing output has declined over the past year."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"Household spending continues to be strong, supported by a healthy job market, rising incomes, and solid consumer confidence."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,The overall economy is growing at a moderate rate.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"The U.S. economy is in its 11th year of expansion, and the baseline outlook remains favorable."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,We believe that monetary policy is in a good place.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"As I will explain shortly, the policy adjustments we have made since last year are providing—and will continue to provide—meaningful support to the economy."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,We took this step to help keep the U.S. economy strong in the face of global developments and to provide some insurance against ongoing risks.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,Today we decided to lower the interest rates for the third time this year.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,We’re committed to making the best decisions we can based on facts and objective analysis.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,We do this by steadfastly pursuing the goals that Congress has given us: maximum employment and stable prices.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,My colleagues at the Federal Reserve and I are dedicated to serving the American people.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"Good afternoon, and welcome."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"Transcript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference October 30, 2019 CHAIR POWELL."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"We had surveyed the banks carefully about what was their lowest comfortable level of reserves, and many banks that were well above that level did not take that excess cash and invest it in the repo market at much higher rates."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"Overall, we continue to see sustained expansion of economic activity, a strong labor market, and inflation near our symmetric 2 percent objective as most likely."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"The performance of the economy has been—particularly the household sector—has been strong, has been resilient, with low unemployment, attractive levels of job creation, wages moving up, labor force participation moving up, household confidence, and solid gains in many measures of consumer spending."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"While this has been our outlook for quite some time, our views about the path of interest rates that will best achieve these outcomes have changed significantly over the past year."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"These factors, in conjunction with muted inflation pressures, have led us to lower our assessment of the appropriate level of the federal funds rate over the past year."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"And as far as global Wall Street’s primary question, what kind of change in the economy would cause you to reassess—some sort of significant deterioration in what?"
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,Do you consider rates to be accommodative enough now to achieve your goal of sustaining the expansion?
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I guess the question is, is this it?"
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,Michael McKee with Bloomberg Radio and Television.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHAEL MCKEE.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,I will be happy to take your questions.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"In contrast, increasing the supply of reserves by purchasing Treasury bills only alters the mix of short-term assets held by the public and should not materially affect demand and supply for longer-term securities or financial conditions more broadly."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"In those programs, we purchased longer-term securities to put downward pressure on longer-term interest rates and ease broader financial conditions."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"In particular, our Treasury bill purchases should not be confused with the large-scale asset purchase programs that we deployed after the financial crisis."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,They do not represent a change in the stance of monetary policy.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,These actions are purely technical measures to support the effective implementation of monetary policy as we continue to learn about the appropriate level of reserves.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"To achieve this ample level, we announced on October 11 that we would purchase Treasury bills at least into the second quarter of next year as well as continue temporary open market operations at least through January."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"In response to the funding pressures in money markets that emerged in mid-September, we concluded that it would be appropriate to maintain, over a time—over time, a level of reserve balances at or above the level that prevailed in early September of this year."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"In the transition to the efficient and effective level of reserves in this regime, we slowed the gradual decline in our balance sheet in March and we stopped it in July."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"In that operating framework, we control the federal funds rate primarily by setting our administered rates, not through frequent interventions to actively manage the supply of reserves."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"In January, we made the key decision to continue to implement monetary policy in an ample-reserves regime."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,Let me end with a few words about our technical monetary policy operations.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,Policy is not on a preset course.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"Of course, if developments emerge that cause a material reassessment of our outlook, we would respond accordingly."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"Looking ahead, we’ll be monitoring the effects of our policy actions, along with other information bearing on the outlook, as we assess the appropriate path of the target range for the fed funds rate."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,We believe monetary policy is in a good place to achieve these outcomes.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"We see the current stance of monetary policy as likely to remain appropriate as long as incoming information about the economy remains broadly consistent with our outlook of moderate economic growth, a strong labor market, and inflation near our symmetric 2 percent objective."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"Since monetary policy operates with a lag, the full effects of these adjustments on economic growth, the job market, and inflation will be realized over time."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,The policy adjustments we’ve made to date will continue to provide significant support for the economy.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"In both July and September, we reduced the target rate [range] for the federal funds rate by ¼ percentage point, and we did so again today, bringing the range to 1½ to 1¾ percent."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"As I mentioned, weakness in global growth and trade developments have weighed on the economy and pose ongoing risks."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"And inflation expectations have also kind of moved down and sideways—both surveys and market based over the course of this—of, really, the recent months."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"The manufacturing sector, particularly manufacturing, and also investment and exports have been weaker."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,We think it’s essential that we do that.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"It was about, specifically, these kinds of high-pressure labor gains that you’ve talked about."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"So if you were to describe the shifts that you’ve made so far, it wasn’t just about trade uncertainty."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,BRENDAN GREELEY.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we feel like those shifts are appropriate to support exactly the outcomes you’re talking about, which are a continuing strong labor market, continued strong job creation."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s a very substantial shift, and the effects of it will be felt over time."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"We entered the year expecting some further rate increases, we went to “patient,” now we’ve done three rate cuts."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mean, I think we’re keeping—I think we’ve made very substantial adjustments to policy over the course of this year, if you think about it."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"Well, I think we’re doing that."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"If that’s something that you’re identifying, and that’s something that the Fed is learning more about this year, why not continue to push those gains, particularly for people who are reentering the labor force?"
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,You mentioned it just now when you were talking.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"The other thing you’ve talked about in this review is the gains that a super high-pressure labor market have, particularly for the communities that you’re talking about."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"Brendan Greeley, the Financial Times."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,BRENDAN GREELEY.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,So I think we would need to see a really significant move up in inflation that’s persistent before we would consider raising rates to address inflation concerns.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"And you know, we haven’t yet—we just touched 2 percent core inflation, to pick one measure—just touched it for a few months, and then we’ve fallen back."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,So that’s really about inflation.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,You come back to the question of raising rates.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think it would take some time after the recent things, but I do think it would be quite positive over time."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"I wouldn’t expect that the effects on activity or confidence would be immediate, or—would there be immediate effects in economic activity."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, ultimately, it could affect activity."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I would just say that a—if we were to have a sustained reduction in trade tensions—broad reduction in trade tensions and a resolution of these uncertainties, that would bode well for business sentiment, which is—trade uncertainty’s been weighing on business sentiment, in our judgment, in the judgment of many analysts."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,Yes.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"So could there be a point, or how—I guess my question is, how big of an impact on monetary policy would removing that uncertainty be?"
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"So you remove that uncertainty, prices, then, would naturally rise."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,It was—so we’ve said it was about three things.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,I’ve heard that argument from a Fed president from one of the Districts.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s been about the slowing global economy.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s been building for just about 18 months now, and that’s having an effect on U.S. activity."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s one thing.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, we think that inflation expectations are very important in driving actual inflation, and we’re strongly committed to achieving our 2 percent inflation objective on a symmetric basis."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,So we’re going to be adding reserves to get back to that place.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, one thing is that we think we need reserves to be back up to the level—the minimum level of reserves that we can have during the various fluctuations that you see with reserves is something like $1.45 trillion or a little higher, and that’s the level in early September."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"In terms of the causes, so there’s a lot of forensic work going on by us and by market participants and all kinds of analysts."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"Yes, through January."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we’ve said that temporary open market operations we expect to continue, I think, at least until the end of January, I believe."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, on the “how long,” what we’ve said is that we expect bill purchases to continue at least into the second quarter of next year."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,Okay.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,Do you feel like you have a good sense of what’s going on there?
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, do you still feel like it’s just—that there is not enough reserves in the system?"
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, given the fact that, you know, the repo operations—it seems like the Fed is having to increase the amount of liquidity—temporary liquidity that it’s injecting into the system."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"On the Fed’s balance sheet—you all recently resumed purchases of Treasury bills, and I was just wondering, how long do you expect that to continue?"
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,VICTORIA GUIDA.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"They are a reason for us to want to extend the expansion, and that’s something we’re committed to doing."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,We do call them out.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"At the same time, we have to think about the whole economy, and—but, yes, those gains are very positive."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, by the way, that there’s also—there’s still so many people who are, you know, still not in the labor market yet, and that—there’s just a lot more good that can be done there."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know from our Fed Listens events that we’ve been hearing from people who live and work in low- and moderate-income communities that this is the best labor market they’ve seen in their lifetime, things like that."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s a great thing.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s particularly the fact that people at the lower end of wages have been getting most of the benefit of most of the wage gains in the last couple of years.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"I would say, the gains in the labor market have been great to see."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,So we’ve been doing it to address all of those things.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we’ve had inflation, which—we’ve called out the risk of inflation running persistently below 2 percent as a risk that we needed to address."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’ve had trade policy uncertainty, which we think also has been weighing on activity and investment and sentiment."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"That’s part of the weakness in manufacturing, export, and business investment."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,You have a synchronized slowdown in economic activity around the globe.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,Uncertainty is keeping the prices low.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"Well, no."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"Yes, because I’ve heard the argument that trade’s causing the uncertainty."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,Nick Timiraos with the Wall Street Journal.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,NICK TIMIRAOS.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, I’m saying it now, so— STEVE LIESMAN."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s a—you know, it’s a judgment call."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"Well, there’s—there’s a lot of, you know, practice and science and history, in terms of how much you put in the actual postmeeting statement as opposed to what we say in the press conference statement."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"I’m sorry, just to—why isn’t the phrase “likely to remain appropriate” in the statement if that’s the sense of the Committee?"
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,STEVE LIESMAN.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"It really—it would be a reassessment of—a material reassessment of our overall outlook, which is what I described."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,So that’s really how we’re thinking about it.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"We also say, of course, if developments emerge that cause a material reassessment of that outlook, we would respond accordingly."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s—so that’s what we’re saying about that.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we think that the current stance of policy is likely to remain appropriate—likely to remain appropriate—as long as incoming information about the economy is broadly consistent with our outlook, which is a positive one of moderate economic growth, strong labor market, and inflation moving close to 2 percent."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"Are you on hold and need to be proved wrong that you should remain on hold, or is it, really, you could go either way here?"
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"So how do I walk away from this, and what should we walk away from this believing what “appropriate” means?"
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"You came in, and you used the word “appropriate,” that the current rate is “likely to remain appropriate,” which means you’re on hold."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,So the statement says that the Committee is going “to monitor the implications of incoming information for the outlook as it assesses the appropriate path of the target range.” That tells me you could go either way.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"Mr. Chairman, I’m—not to make light of it, but I’m a little bit—I wonder if you could help me out with the appropriate understanding of the word “appropriate” here."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"Mr.—Steve Liesman, CNBC."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,STEVE LIESMAN.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,What we’re really thinking now is that our current stance of policy is appropriate and will remain so as long as the outlook is broadly in keeping with our expectations.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,There obviously will be times in the future where that will be appropriate.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,So we’re not thinking about raising rates right now.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"You described the recent slide, Chair Powell, in inflation expectations as “unwelcome.” You said that inflation expectations are “very important.” What, if anything, would the Committee be prepared to do to address this slide in inflation expectations if it continued?"
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,I can’t point to one data point or one thing that would change our minds.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,EDWARD LAWRENCE.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,Rate hikes for next year.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, as I mentioned, we do think that inflation expectations are— they’re quite essential, quite central in our framework of how we think about inflation."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,I’m sorry.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"How big of a change could that be to the monetary policy as it stands here, and could we see rate cuts next year—or, rate hikes next year?"
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"So how big of a change, then, to monetary policy would there be if you get some of that uncertainty cleared up—specifically, the phase-one China trade deal finished and USMCA ratified?"
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for taking this."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,Edward Lawrence of Fox Business.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,I have some confidence in that.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think we’ll wrap it up around the middle of next year, would be my guess."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,I don’t think we’ll take many years here.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,EDWARD LAWRENCE.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"These are—you know, these changes to monetary policy frameworks happen—they don’t happen really quickly, let’s say."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we’re in the middle—we’re really quite in the middle of it now, and my thinking is still that it will run into the middle of next year."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,Inflation targeting took many years to evolve.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s at the very heart of what we’re doing in the review.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,How soon do you think that review might be announced to the public?
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,NICK TIMIRAOS.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,So we’re committed to doing that.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"And it comes down to using your policy tools to achieve 2 percent inflation, and that is the—that is the thing that must happen for credibility in this area."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,But we’re in the middle of thinking about ways that we can make that symmetric 2 percent inflation objective more credible by achieving symmetric 2 percent inflation.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,We haven’t made them yet.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s too early to be announcing decisions.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’re also, as part of our review, looking at potential innovations, changes to the way we think about things, changes to the framework that would lead us—that would be more supportive of achieving inflation on a 2 percent—on a symmetric 2 percent basis over time."
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s what we’re doing now.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,And we think that we need to conduct policy in a way that supports that outcome.
2019-10-30,Press Conf - Full Text,We need them to be anchored in a level—at a level that’s consistent with our symmetric 2 percent inflation goal.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, in terms of—you know, I—again, I don’t want to get into hypothetical outcomes, though, if that’s all right."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"Monetary policy is not the right tool to react in the very short term to volatility and, you know, things that can change back and forth and back and forth as this has happened, as is probably typical of a—of a large complex negotiation."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’re—we look at a range of factors and we’ve—as I’ve said before, we try to look through the volatility in trade news and trade negotiations."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,We try not to react.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,We can’t react.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,DONNA BORAK.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"The idea that we were trying to, you know, slow the economy down—we were really just trying to get near neutral."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"Did you have any advice for him when it came to this, and did you express some concerns about the potential volatility and the impact of the economy on—given all this?"
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, I—I’m going to stick with my and my predecessors’ longtime practice of not discussing private meetings with elected officials—or other officials, really."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,I would say—we’ll just have to see.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,But thank you.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"I’m just wondering, you met with the President last month."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, I wouldn’t want to speculate on—on a hypothetical."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,So policy was always accommodative during the course of that year.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"To follow up on Edward’s trade question, could you talk about what you would imagine the economic effect would be if negotiations with China were to fall apart and how the Fed might be able to support the economy in that event?"
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"Chair Powell, Donna Borak with CNN."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,DONNA BORAK.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, that’s what—that would be my story."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s not up to us to make a judgment about that.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, again, that’s not to make a judgment."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think, also, the trade situation was just beginning in the middle of ’18, and I think it had—has had—you know, I think there’ll be a very, very wide range of estimates of the effect, but I think it’s had a meaningful effect on output just through the uncertainty channel and, to a lesser extent, through—through, you know, the tariff effects."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,You’ve had quite a significant—that does affect us.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"Just look at the IMF’s forecasts of growth from, you know, the spring of 2018 and compare them to now."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"You saw the global economic slowdown begin in the middle of last year, gather force, and then continue to go on this year, so you’ve seen a continual weakening."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think what’s happened is, the—obviously, the facts on the ground have changed."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"And even with the last rate increase a year ago, we were still meaningfully below the median estimate on the Committee of what the neutral rate was."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,VIRGINIE MONTET.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mean, as you said, going around the country for all the Listen events, I don’t think I heard anybody worry about a 4 percent inflation rate or think that a higher inflation rate was going to be a problem."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"Yesterday, Democratic leaders in the House have launched an impeachment process against the President."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,It still seems to me to be the right thing in hindsight.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,So where does that concern come from?
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,Is it members of Congress that have—have said this?
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I—people keep coming back and saying why—asking why you took off, like, a 4 percent inflation rate off the table even when it started."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"Chairman Powell, many people seem worried that the framework that you guys are working on is going to be—the results are going to be less rather than more."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,Greg Robb from MarketWatch.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,GREG ROBB.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"So its more—but it can it be useful if—and I think—but, as I said, it’s been a challenge, and so I—I do—I do like to say, if you focus too much on the dots, you can—you can miss the broader picture."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"And if the fact—dots that we did six months ago or three months ago don’t agree with that, that’s not even in the conversation."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,We’re going to do what we think is the right thing for the economy.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"And when the economic outlook is changing, the dots are—they’re just not a consideration."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I think, particularly at inflection points, it’s hard to convey the reality, which is that policy is always going to depend on the economic outlook and changes in the economic outlook."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,There’s no plan.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,Virginie Montet with Agence France-Presse.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,There is no—there’s no agreement.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"Remember that we write all that down, and we send it in, and it gets compiled."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"And what it is is, it’s an expression of the thinking about individual Committee members about appropriate monetary policy and the path of the economy."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, I think “properly understood” to me means looking at what it is and not at what it isn’t."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"With—I think properly understood, it can be useful, but that’s been a challenge."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"Does the Fed’s dot plot still serve a useful communications purpose, or do you feel that it might be time to retire it or change it in some fashion?"

2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHAEL DERBY.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,We don’t consider things like that.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,We have not.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,No.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"Have you mentioned these developments within the Committee, as—today as potentially presenting some risks for their confidence in the economy?"
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"But we don’t discuss it at the meeting, and we don’t negotiate a plan."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"We took steps to make it less accommodative, and that seemed to be the right thing."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"And on the standing repo facility, is it, you know, that you would be inclined to do it, but you need to figure out the details?"
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,We never got policy even at the level of what we thought the neutral rate was at the time.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,What were you looking at that seemed to be so much lower?
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,What caused you to make that change for the statement?
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,You seem very confident that—or it implies there’s a lot of confidence that those uncertainties have gone away.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"I wanted to ask, the only change in the statement was a drop in the reference to uncertainties around the economy."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Chris Rugaber at Associated Press."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,CHRISTOPHER RUGABER.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"These things that we’re working on now, though—like, you know, going through year-end with the overnight facilities and the bill purchases and the term repo—those are—those are things we have to do right now and are doing."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,Those things take time.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"But those are things, you know, the—if they take rule changes, it’ll take, you know, a notice of public rulemaking—it’ll take three months and things like that."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we think there is some of that, though—and so we’re working hard and fast."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"What are we—I mean, I—so I think we’re—we are more focused, frankly, on the T—the bill purchases, the year-end, and also the review of supervisory and regulatory issues that we’re digging into, and—because we think, you know, there’s—these are structural things—right?— where you could, without sacrificing safety and soundness, just allow the—allow the liquidity that is already there to flow more freely, perhaps by making fairly straightforward, noncontroversial changes."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"Standing repo facility—so your question on that is, what are we thinking about it?"
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"Well, we did, actually—if you look at the statement, you’ll notice that we—we did call out global developments and muted inflation pressures later in the statement."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, there may come a time when we—when we talk about that, but we haven’t done much of that."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"I don’t know that at some point we won’t have those discussions, but, you know, Treasury—we want Treasury to be able to have the cash that it needs."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"In terms of the—the TGA, you know, we have not tried to pull the TGA into this yet; we’ve taken it as exogenous."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"Notwithstanding that, we have—we’ve gone out to try to understand that, talking to supervisors."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"Some of them have lots of reserves and, you know, fewer Treasuries, and then they change their mind and they switch, so it’s not obvious that there’s one thing happening there."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,And you see them making quite different choices.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"So you have to have—you have a business model, and that business model suggests what your stress outflows will be, and that suggests what your buffer should be."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’ve talked to supervisors, and—it’s interesting, if you look at the banks, they’re all over the place on the composition of their—of their buffer."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, on Treasuries versus reserves, we’ve done a ton of work on that."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,Or—or what would kind of drive the decision on whether or not to do that?
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,Are you talking to the Treasury Department about maybe reducing the level of volatility in their account at the Fed?
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"Are you currently, for example, telling examiners not to prefer reserves over Treasuries for supervisory purposes?"
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,And then we should—we are essentially taking that as exogenous to our—to our work.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,So there was no sense of it being restrictive.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,And why did we do that?
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’ve put now in place policies that we think are appropriate to address those things, so we’re not revisiting that."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,So it wasn’t that—so we moved—we moved policy up during the course of the year.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"We had an economy growing at 3 percent, we had inflation at 2 percent, and we had a trillion and a half dollars’ worth of stimulus arriving, and the federal funds rate was 1.4 percent."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, if you look back at 2018—I’ll just take you back to the beginning of 2018."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I—this wouldn’t be a—my response will not be about Paul Volcker, but—so, well, you started with Paul Volcker."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"I wonder if, in hindsight, that shadow was—was too long, and if—in the decades since his tenure and, in particular, last year, if the Fed was too quick to raise interest rates to attack an inflation bogeyman that didn’t materialize."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"You started out by talking about Paul Volcker, who obviously cast a—a long shadow."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you Mr. Chairman, Scott Horsley for NPR."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,SCOTT HORSLEY.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,We’ll— we’ll look at a full range of data and other information bearing on the economic outlook.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,There isn’t any single factor that will determine our decisions.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"In terms of what’s—you know, what is material at the end of the day, well, I would just say, whether or not a change in the outlook merits a policy response will be a collective judgment of the FOMC."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,So you’ve—you’ve had quite a significant move in the direction of higher accommodation.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, those are the things that we’ve been monitoring all year."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"In fact, if you look at—more broadly at the Treasury yield curve, it has moved more than 75 basis points."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,So that’s one reason to hold back and—and wait.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,So that’ll take some time.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we do believe that monetary policy operates with long and variable lags, and that it will take some time before the full effects of those actions are seen in the economy."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s 75 basis points’ worth of cuts.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, I mean, one thing that we’re mindful of is that we’ve cut rates three times since July."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"Does it reduce your ability to act preemptively the way, arguably, you did this year?"
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,Does a material reassessment mean you need to see data actually worsen?
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,Some economists do.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"We were talking about rate hikes, but no—no Fed policymaker seems to foresee any cuts next year."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"Well, just to follow real quick, on the material—material reassessment aspect, are you worried that that has set too high a bar for potential cuts next year?"
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,CHRISTOPHER RUGABER.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"But those are—those are just key things, and they haven’t gone away, so we thought it was appropriate to mention them there—still subject to the idea that, for us to change our stance, we would want to see a material reassessment of the outlook."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,And we thought—I think we took strong measures.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,No.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"Ultimately, if it’s tight, those should be—should be reflected in higher wage increases, so it does come down to that."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,And we’re just at the stage where we’ve had a really interesting discussion about the various tools that we have at the October meeting.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,Hi.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,HANNAH LANG.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"And it’s a very positive thing, but it does sort of provide more labor supply, meaning a less tight labor market."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"Notwithstanding that, against that trend, we’ve seen prime-age participation moving up pretty steadily over the last two or three years."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"For many years, we’ve thought that there’s a trend decline in participation."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’re seeing—really, it showed up through higher participation."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,And I think we are seeing that.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,It may just be that there’s more slack in the economy.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,So why is that?
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"But you wouldn’t—that shouldn’t have much of an effect, actually."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"The level of wage inflation has actually moved down, although, there may be compositional effects in that number that may—that may be, to some extent, about younger workers coming in at lower wages that—than retiring workers."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"And now, unemployment has been in the threes for a year and a half, and we still see wage inflation, as you mentioned."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"People were writing down numbers in the fives, and then they were writing down numbers in the fours."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,Hannah Lang with American Banker.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I would also say that we—if you ask people, and we did ask people, what do you think the natural rate of unemployment is?"
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"Just as far as the market not being as tight as you thought, are you saying there are still more people on the sidelines who could join the labor force?"
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,Can I ask a quick follow-up?
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, again, at the end of the day, that probably has most to do with productivity."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s just—they’re not moving up at—at very high rates.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,So you do see wages moving up.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"And so, you do see—and wages are going up the most for people at the lower end of the—that’s been true for the last couple of years—lower end of the wage spectrum."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"I will say, though, if you look, for example, at nonsupervisory employees in the labor report, there are— their wages are going up at 3.7 percent."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, I think there—there are many, many possible explanations."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"Another thing is, though, that the labor market may not be as tight as we had thought it was."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,You don’t see— there isn’t the kind of traction in the wage market that—even in a tight labor market.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think that hangs over the wage-setting process—and everywhere, pretty much."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"Well, yes."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"I also think there are other possible potential explanations, such as, you know, globalization can be—the idea that you can make, manufacture, or even provide services anywhere in the world to anywhere in the world."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks for being here today.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"Are you concerned that this might cause confusion, and how would the mechanics work if this proposal is finalized without the Fed?"
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,I wanted to ask more about the— the repo issues and what you all are doing beyond open market operations.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"You’d want to see, you know, higher wages."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"Ultimately, though, we’d like to see—to call it “hot,” you’d want to see heat."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"But the one that has—that is kind of suggesting that you’re—it’s a healthy number that, you know, the sort of 3.1 percent average hourly earnings number is a decent number—3.7 percent for production and nonsupervisory workers is more healthy."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, we look at countless measures of labor market—you know, labor utilization, and there’s so many— it’s too many to count."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"I don’t know that it’s tight, because you’re not seeing wage increases, you know."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,So I’ll say that the labor market is strong.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,Someone asked me a question about a hot labor market—that was in the Humphrey-Hawkins hearings.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,I don’t really want to say that it’s tight.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mean, we—there’s so many other measures that suggest that the labor market is—I like to say the labor market is strong."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"Really, wages."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"Would it be a contract—or, rather, some sort of change in either the headline number of gains or in the unemployment rate?"
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"I just wanted to ask about the Community Reinvestment Act, since the FDIC and OCC may potentially join together with a—for a proposal without the Fed."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"So to expand a bit, I guess, on Nancy’s question, it seems like the wage Phillips curve has been pretty well explored already, but what would you need to see to call the labor market “hot” in that case?"
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, before the July meeting, you said something kind of colorful."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,Brian Cheung with Yahoo Finance.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,Hi there.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,BRIAN CHEUNG.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"So that’s something we—I hope we don’t have to face, but we will if we have to."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"We would certainly not want to create confusion or, you know, sort of tension between the regimes if they do turn out to be slightly different regimes."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"It will have to—well, we’ll just have to see, but—and if we—if we can’t, I don’t—I’m not sure what the path forward would be."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, I don’t know whether that’ll be possible or not."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,And my hope is that we can still do that.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’ve thought that for some time, and we worked very hard to try to get aligned with the OCC, really, on—on a proposal."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,We also think it’s time for modernization.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, you know, we think the CRA—we know the CRA is a very important law, and we’re strongly committed to the mission of ensuring that banks provide credit to their—throughout their communities, particularly addressing the needs of low- and moderate- income households and neighborhoods."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"You said, “To call something ‘hot,’ you would need to see some heat,” referring to the labor market."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"Productivity has been low, and that—that is very likely to be holding back wages."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,So wages should go up to cover inflation and productivity.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"For instance, one would be that productivity has just been low."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,I’m confident we will be.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,And I think we will be.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"But I think—and if we do this, then in a few years, again and again and things like that, then we can—at least we’re moving in a good direction."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"These things don’t tend to move in— you know, in a lurchy way, they tend to evolve."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,We want to—we want to have this be a successful exercise where we meaningfully improve our monetary policy framework.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,It doesn’t mean it has to solve every problem going forward.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, you know, I think—I’d like for this review to come out with very—a set of positive results—you know, meaningful improvements."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mean, I think it’s a fair question."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,Is that within our legal mandate?
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,Is that really price stability?
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"I also think, is 4 percent—you’d have to ask the question, is that really, you know, price stability?"
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,So I think we—I think you need to lower your sights a little bit.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,DON LEE.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,You haven’t been able to get it to 2.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I think if you said, “We’re raising the inflation target to 4,” what would be the effect of that?"
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,So I’ll go back to the point that just saying words is not itself credible.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,You know—and if you define going anywhere as a 4 percent inflation target—let me talk about the 4 percent inflation target.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,In terms of “4 percent”—so that’s—I think it’s premature for people to be saying that this isn’t going anywhere.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,I do.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,No one—I believe we will be able to—to reach a successful conclusion and make meaningful improvements.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,And I wouldn’t prejudge.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"And that is— in effect, that is our framework document."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"And those things— many of those things would wind up as changes, if you will, modifications to the “Statement of Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy.” I think that process will take until the middle of the year where—but we want to approach it very thoroughly and very carefully."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, what do we take away from all this?"
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,So we’re just getting to the stage where we’re looking at conclusions.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,So we had a—we talked about the Fed Listens events and some very interesting research.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"At this meeting, we talked about the way monetary policy affects different groups in the economy."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mean, where’s the credibility in that, really?"
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,Don Lee with the L.A. Times.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"Chair Powell, you’ve had a busy year, and I’m wondering, as you look back, what things you might have done differently."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,And are there any lessons that you would take into next year?
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,I think there are a range of explanations.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,And it’s a couple of things.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"So why aren’t they growing higher, at a faster rate?"
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"Now you see them moving up, you know, more at 3, 3½ percent."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"If you look back three, four years, you’ll see wages are growing around 2 percent."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"Well, wage gains have moved up a bit."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,Why is that?
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,Wages are growing more slowly now than they were toward the beginning of the year.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"Chair Powell, why aren’t we seeing stronger wage gains?"
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,I’m Nancy Marshall-Genzer from Marketplace.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, again, I think both the economy and monetary policy right now, I think, are in a good place."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,I think our moves will prove appropriate.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I didn’t expect the—to face the challenges, but I think we did face them, and I think we—I’m pleased that we moved to support the economy in the way that we did."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think that, toward the end of 2018, there was still a sense the economy was growing at around 3 percent."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,I think they were a surprise.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"I didn’t—obviously, you know, didn’t see and I don’t think anybody saw coming the—the challenges that we faced this year."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"Well, I—so, yes."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mean, are there any particular surprises, whether it’s the economy or how markets or financial— CHAIR POWELL."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,DON LEE.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, we’re always going to be trying to learn lessons."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,There’s— there’s a lot of learning that comes into—from the economy every year and in the way we do our jobs.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, I don’t know how to get after that."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know—I mean, it’s too long of a question."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,I think our policy stance is appropriate and likely to remain so as long as the outlook is broadly like this.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"I like where we are on policy, as I mentioned."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"Well, you know, I have to say, my total focus is on right now and getting policy right and thinking about next year—you know, thinking about what’s the economy going to be doing."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"So let me say, we’re—we’ve been working on this all year."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Victoria Guida with Politico."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHAEL MCKEE.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I think we know that, and I think the review certainly underscores that, but that’s—that’s a very important insight."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"So this is that we did, in fact, turn out to do three rate cuts."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,And that’s the same situation we believe we’re in here.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"And the notion just is that it’s a—the economy needed slightly more accommodative policy, but it wasn’t the end of the expansion, right?"
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"So there’s similarities, conceptual similarities, I think, between the two instances during that long expansion, I guess in ’95 and ’98, when the Fed cut three times only to resume raising rates."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, were these those kind of rate cuts, the kind that you need to take back, or are we at a place now where we’re at a neutral rate—“take back,” I mean if those risks that you say we’re cushioning from don’t materialize in the way you think—or is this now a new sort of steady state for the economy at this rate, this is the right rate for the economy that you see going forward and don’t need to take those rate cuts back?"
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"Within seven months of those ’98 rate cuts, the Fed took them back and then some."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"You’ve used the analogy to 1998 to describe the rate cuts we just went through, and I’m wondering if we can sort of continue the analogy."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"Mr. Chairman, Steve Liesman CNBC."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,STEVE LIESMAN.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"But we do still see some relationship, and that’s what you’re seeing in those numbers."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"The same thing is true, but much less true, of inflation, the relationship between—in a way, the wage Phillips curve has a higher coefficient than the price Phillips curve does."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"And now the whole group of different wage measures that we monitor has moved up to 3 and 3½ percent, and that suggests tightening."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"That wasn’t in the plan, you know, in any kind of specific way at the beginning."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"If you look—look at where wages were three or four years ago, they were running around 2 percent."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,But it’s still there.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,It just is quite faint.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"So it’s much, much lower than it used to be, but I don’t know that it’s gone down any more in the last decade."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,The coefficient is something like 0.1.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mean, we—the—again, the relationship between slack in the economy and inflation is weak, has been weak."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, I don’t think that’s right."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, in that case, what do you do to reach your target?"
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"If I could follow up on that—I mean, it’s faint to nonexistent, though, it seems to me, so this suggests that, really, your policy lever as it exists now isn’t really influencing prices at all."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,HOWARD SCHNEIDER.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we believe that policy is somewhat accommodative, and we think that that’s the appropriate place for policy to be in order to drive up inflation."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,would need to keep policy somewhat accommodative.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,And I—what that suggests is that you 1 Chair Powell intended to say the repurchase operations were announced in October.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mean, you can see it."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"And then as the Fed got control of inflation, the connection got weaker and weaker and weaker, to the point where there’s still a connection, but it’s—it’s a very faint one."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,So that’s the same.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"So now, as you can see, inflation is barely moving up, notwithstanding that unemployment is at 50-year lows and expected to remain there."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’re open to ideas for modifying supervisory and regulatory practice in ways that don’t undermine safety and soundness, and a number of ideas are under—under examination there."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"There are—there are payments issues, there have been a number of supervisory and regulatory issues raised—we’re looking carefully at those."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,And we’ve been very carefully looking at the reasons why that might have happened.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"So the question is, why did that happen?"
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"So what had happened was that liquidity, which actually existed, didn’t flow into the repo market, and that had effects on the federal funds rate."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"And yet we saw, actually, in September that reserves—the markets acted as though reserves had become scarce."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"Meanwhile, we had surveyed all of the banks, and particularly the large banks who hold a lot of the reserves, and said, “What’s your lowest comfortable level of reserves?” We got those numbers, we added them up, we added a buffer, and it came out sort of at a level that was well below where we were in September."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, taking you back, this—as you know, we had very gradually allowed the balance sheet to shrink, we slowed that gradual pace by half in March, and then we ended it in July."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"The purpose of all this is not to eliminate all volatility, particularly in the repo market."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"We have the tools to accomplish that, and we will use them."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"And the purpose of all this, let’s remember, is to assure that our monetary policy decisions will be transmitted to the federal funds rate, which in turn affects other short-term rates."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’re committed to robustly implementing that framework, as you can see by our actions."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’d decided back in January to remain an ample-reserves regime, and that means we will be setting the federal funds rate—the range for the federal funds rate through our administered rates and not through active management of the level of reserves."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"What’s different is, you have a very different—you have very different structural characteristics in the economy, particularly around inflation."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,So I guess I want to start by stressing that these are very important operational matters but that are not likely to have any macroeconomic implications.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,Do you have any plans to sell coupons?
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"There was a report yesterday from Credit Suisse suggesting there’s a good chance that we will see disruptions, and one of the reasons they put for it is that the Fed is at this point buying only T-bills, and the market wants to sell coupons."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, given that we’re approaching year-end for the markets, will you be taking any extra steps to ensure that funding is available in the repo and FX swaps markets?"
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,I’d like to ask you if you agree with the BIS findings.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,The BIS concluded in September that the repo spike was not a one-off confluence of random events but reflected structural and regulatory issues that could lead to a recurrence.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"Michael McKee, Bloomberg radio and television."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,The BIS concluded in—I did the same thing as Howard.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, I would say, similarities and differences."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s quite different in ’95 and ’98 when there were those two adjustments.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"In fact, we need some upward pressure on inflation to get back to 2 percent."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, by the way, this is—it’s a good thing that, you know, we think we can—I think we’ve learned that unemployment can remain at quite low levels for an extended period of time without unwanted upward pressure on inflation."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,So the need for rate increases is less.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I’m going to take a little step back, and I will—I will get to your specific questions on the year-end and on T-bills."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"To go through it sort of by—in time, we started off, really, on September 17 with overnight operations."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"If you go back 50 years, you would have seen that, when there was—when labor markets were tight and unemployment was low, inflation moved right up."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,These developments underscore for us the importance of sustaining the expansion so that the strong job market reaches more of those left behind.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,Employment gains have been broad based across all racial and ethnic groups and all levels of education.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,People who live and work in low- and middle-income communities tell us that many who have struggled to find work are now finding new opportunities.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"And wages have been rising, particularly for lower-paying jobs."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"Participation in the labor force by people in their prime working years, ages 25 through 54, has been increasing."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"The unemployment rate has been near half-century lows for well more than a year, and the pace of job gains remains solid."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"As seen from FOMC participants’ most recent projections, the median expectation for real GDP growth slows slightly over the next few years but remains near 2 percent."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"And with a strong household sector and supportive monetary and financial conditions, we expect moderate growth to continue."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"Even so, the overall economy has been growing moderately."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"As has been the case for some time, sluggish growth abroad and trade developments have been weighing on those sectors."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"In contrast, business investment and exports remain weak, and manufacturing output has declined over the past year."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"Household spending has been strong, supported by a healthy job market, rising incomes, and solid consumer confidence."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"The economic expansion is in its 11th year, the longest on record."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,We expect the job market to remain strong.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"With our decisions through the course of the past year, we believe that monetary policy is well positioned to serve the American people by supporting continued economic growth, a strong job market, and inflation near our symmetric 2 percent goal."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"As always, we base our decisions on judgment of how best to achieve the goals Congress has given us: maximum employment and price stability."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"Turning to today’s meeting, my colleagues and I decided to leave our policy rate unchanged after lowering it a total of ¾ percentage point at the previous three meetings."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,My colleagues and I continue to draw inspiration from his example.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"With courage, integrity, and tenacity, he always pursued the policies that he believed would ultimately benefit all Americans."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"He believed that there is no higher calling than public service, and he dedicated the lion’s share of his life to it."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,But what is perhaps most admirable about him— more than his many accomplishments—was his character.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"Of course, he’s best known for leading the fight to tame the double-digit inflation that he inherited as Chair, thus laying the foundation for the prosperity and price stability we enjoy today."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,He accomplished many things during his long and distinguished career at the Fed and elsewhere.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,Paul Volcker served as Federal Reserve Chair from 1979 to 1987.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"To begin, I’d like to say a few words about Paul Volcker, who, as you know, passed away earlier this week."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"Good afternoon, everyone."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"Transcript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference December 11, 2019 CHAIR POWELL."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,VICTORIA GUIDA.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,Our economic outlook remains a favorable one despite global developments and ongoing risks.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"Well, that’s—what’s happening there is the fact that the relationship between resource utilization, or unemployment, and inflation has just gotten weaker and weaker over the years."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,The median of participants’ projections for the unemployment rate remains below 4 percent over the next several years.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"Over the 12 months through October, total PCE inflation was 1.3 percent, and core inflation—which excludes volatile food and energy prices and is a better indicator of future inflation—was 1.6 percent."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"You seem to have unemployment penciled in here now for three years running—more—underneath the longer-run level, yet inflation never really accelerates."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I was struck by the, sort of, disconnect that exists here between the behavior of unemployment and inflation."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,Sorry about that.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,[Inaudible remark] Sorry—Howard Schneider with Reuters.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,HOWARD SCHNEIDER.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you, and I’ll be happy to take your questions."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,We stand ready to adjust the details of our operations as appropriate to keep the federal funds rate in the target range.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"To address possible pressures in money markets over the year-end, we’ve been conducting term repo operations spanning year-end."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,Our operations have gone well so far; pressures in money markets over recent weeks have been subdued.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"Finally, I wanted to note that we’ve been purchasing Treasury bills and conducting repurchase operations, consistent with the plan we announced in December.1 These technical operations are aimed at maintaining an ample level of reserves and addressing money market pressures that could adversely affect the implementation of monetary policy."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,Policy is not on a preset course.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"Of course, if developments emerge that cause a material reassessment of our outlook, we would respond accordingly."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"Looking ahead, we will be monitoring the effects of our recent policy actions, along with other information bearing on the outlook, as we assess the appropriate path of the target range for the federal funds rate."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,Inflation continues to run below our symmetric 2 percent objective.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"As long as incoming information about the economy remains broadly consistent with this outlook, the current stance of monetary policy likely will remain appropriate."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"Of course, that is the function of monetary policy—to adjust interest rates to promote employment and price stability in response to forces acting on the economy."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"The medians of participants’ projections for economic growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation are little changed from a year ago, aside from a lower inflation projection for 2019."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,This shift has helped support the economy and has kept the outlook on track.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"Rather than modestly increasing the target rate for the federal funds rate this year, as seemed appropriate a year ago, we reduced it by ¾ percentage point."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"In addition, inflation pressures were unexpectedly muted, strengthening the case for a more supportive stance of policy."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"As the year progressed, we adjusted the stance of monetary policy to cushion the economy from these developments and to provide some insurance against the associated risks."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"Over the course of the past year, our views about the path of interest rates that would best achieve our employment and inflation objectives changed significantly, as the economy faced some important challenges from weaker global growth and trade developments."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,We’re strongly committed to achieving our symmetric 2 percent inflation goal.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,The median of participants’ projection rises to 1.9 percent next year and 2 percent in 2021.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"Against the backdrop of a strong economy and supportive monetary policy, we expect inflation will rise to 2 percent."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"As a result, the scope for interest rate reductions to support the economy in a future downturn would be diminished, resulting in worse economic outcomes for American families and businesses."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"In turn, interest rates would be lower as well and closer to their effective lower bound."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"While low and stable inflation is certainly a good thing, inflation that runs persistently below our objective can lead to an unhealthy dynamic in which longer-term inflation expectations drift down, pulling actual inflation even lower."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"We believe that the current stance of monetary policy will support sustained growth, a strong labor market, and inflation near our symmetric 2 percent objective."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,By October 11 we had created and put into effect a plan.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,So what are we to make of that?
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s working.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"Well, I think you can—you know, it’s—I think you can see that what’s been moving—one way to look at it is, what’s been moving financial markets?"
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"Is—do you see—not commenting on the deals themselves, is one uncertainty— CHAIR POWELL."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,Is one uncertainty bigger than the other?
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,EDWARD LAWRENCE.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I do think that, again, without commenting on it— in any way on the process or the content of the agreement, I think that uncertainty—removal of uncertainty around that would be a positive for the economy as well."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’ve been hearing from our people that we talked to—the many, many people and businesses that we talked to in—through the Reserve Banks that wind up being written up in the Beige Book, and they’ve been telling us all year—for a year and a half, really, that trade policy uncertainty is weighing on the outlook."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I’ll say the same thing about the negotiations with China, which haven’t reached that point yet."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"I will say, though, that getting—if the deal were to be enacted, then it would certainly remove some of the trade policy uncertainty, and that would be, I believe, a positive for the economy."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"Well, I did see the news today that it appears there’s an agreement to move forward to vote on USMCA, and, of course, it’s not our role to comment on particular trade policies or criticize them one way or the other or evaluate them."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"With the House announcing that they will ratify USMCA and Canada and Mexico signing off on it, do you see that uncertainty easing now so the business investment could pick up, or are the trade tensions with China just that big elephant in the room where you might not see those business investments pick up?"
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,I want to ask you about uncertainty.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,We talked a lot about inflation.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s been news about the negotiations with China, not so much USMCA."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,We talked a lot about inflation—Edward Lawrence from Fox Business Network.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, the Fed has great inflation credibility, but inflation expectations are anchored at about their 25-year average, which is a few ticks below 2 percent."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,It’ll have to happen over time as credibility is built.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"Ultimately, it will take time to establish—to move inflation expectations up from where they are, which appears to be a bit below 2 percent, will not happen overnight."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"And so the— the changes that we’re looking at to the framework are—I think they take all of that on board, and—but they’re—what they’re—what they are designed to do is to strengthen the credibility of that—of that inflation target, but only if followed by policy."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"Well, I—you know, I think the answer to the question of whether saying it is enough to create credibility, the answer to that is “no.” And I think you have to back that up with policy that supports the outcome, and that’s what we’re trying to do."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"But if inflation does not materialize, would a change in the framework necessarily make it easier to generate higher inflation?"
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"In other words, it’s one thing to accept inflation rising on its own opportunistically."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"And in that—in that context, is merely saying that you want inflation to rise above 2 percent a sufficient strategy for getting inflation to stay at the target, or would it compel some kind of policy action beyond deferring future rate increases to achieve that outcome if that’s the direction in which the Committee goes?"
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, Chair Powell, I want to ask about the framework review, which obviously entails some kind of debate around allowing an overshoot of the 2 percent target."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"Nick Timiraos, the Wall Street Journal."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,NICK TIMIRAOS.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"So it’s—it’s a real challenge, and—but I think we’re using our tools as best we can to meet that challenge."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,EDWARD LAWRENCE.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I would also point out that this year, which has been a good year for the economy, inflation—core inflation is actually running at 1.6 percent, whereas it ran close to 2 percent most of last year."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,MATTHEW BOESLER.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"Chair Powell, the Fed policy review this year has largely been discussed in terms of the inflation side of the mandate and the need to shore up inflation expectations."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,That plan is in effect.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"And—and the risks of, you know, using accommodative monetary policy, our tool, to explore that are relatively low."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"In fact, it’s already—it’s already understood, I think, that—that there’s more—even though we’re at 3½ percent unemployment, there’s actually more slack out there, in a sense."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, I—I think we have kind of internalized—and this isn’t— this isn’t news for today, this is something we’ve been saying for, you know, for several years— you’ve seen us moving down our estimates of the—of maximum employment."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,Is there anything similar you could do on the employment side?
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"Sorry, if I could just follow up briefly—is there any way to sort of systematize these insights, do you think, with, you know, in terms of—we talk a lot about, for example, makeup strategies on the inflation side."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,MATTHEW BOESLER.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"You also see from the business perspective that companies are taking all kinds of measures to—you know, to look through things on people’s résumés that would have perhaps disqualified them in other kinds of environments, training is moving up—you hear just a lot—there are a lot of things going on that suggest that people at the margins of the labor force are being pulled in and being given chances, which is a great thing."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I think that does also inform our understanding of what we mean by “maximum employment.” And it’s been a very positive—I would say that the Fed Listens events have been—have been extraordinarily positive, and they’re certainly something we’ll repeat."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,And I think that the fact that these communities have so much— such high levels of unemployment and low levels of labor force participation tells you that there is slack out there.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,But it was help to get—helpful to get it in the context of a monetary policy review.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Matthew Boesler at Bloomberg."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I think you—you get a perspective, which—you know, we were already getting that from our extensive outreach to community groups and such."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"I—you know, the Fed Listens events are about inflation to a much lesser extent than they are about maximum employment."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,And that’s—and you see the benefits of that in today’s labor market.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, as I mentioned, that’s a good thing because that means we—we don’t have to worry so much about inflation."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s just been—it’s in estimates not just at the Fed, but among—broadly among economists—labor economists have seen that the connection—that we can sustain much lower levels of unemployment than had been thought."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I think that the—I think, more broadly, over a period of years—many years—we’ve been learning that the natural rate of unemployment is lower."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"And you’re right, though, that we’ve talked here a lot about inflation."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"So the—you know, the focus really is on how to use our strategies, tools, and communications to achieve both sides of the mandate."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,Yes.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"Are there any possibilities, you know, for perhaps systematizing a more asymmetric reaction function with regard to unemployment?"
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,So I’m wondering if you could talk a little bit about the extent to which the review is looking at the employment side of the mandate as well.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"But it seems like the message you’ve been getting from the Fed Listens events and also something else you’ve recently acknowledged is that, you know, the Fed has also been systematically overestimating labor utilization throughout this expansion."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"If you’ve—if you’ve listened to or attended any of those, the discussion—we always focus on inflation as well, but the discussion is really around what’s happening in low- and moderate-income communities and among small businesses."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"If you look around the world, the United States, of all major economies, has been closest to it but still hasn’t quite been able to achieve it."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think the difference between NAFTA and USMCA is—is smaller than the difference between current, you know, arrangements with China and what’s being negotiated."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mean, I would say there’s more humility than there is confidence in this at this point."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,Where do you personally stand on that?
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,They think there should be a rule.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,A number of your colleagues have said explicitly that they do not think the FOMC should raise interest rates until core inflation is back at 2 percent.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,Heather Long from the Washington Post.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,HEATHER LONG.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"We don’t know—we can’t know today what the timing of that will be, but that’s the way—that’s the way we see it going over time."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"I should also mention that after the year-end, the sense of it is that as the underlying level of reserves moves up because of bill purchases, as that happens, there will come a time when it will be appropriate for overnight and term repo to gradually decline."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"At the moment what we’re focused on is, you know—we’re now focused on year-end."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,I think the standing repo facility is something that’ll take some time to evaluate and create the parameters of and put into place.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, on the standing repo facility, as you know, we’ve actually had a couple of meetings where we’ve discussed that."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHAEL MCKEE.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,We’re—we’re focused on—on year-end as well and prepared to adjust our operations as appropriate.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’ll be providing—we’ll be continuing that, and we’re prepared to adjust our tactics."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mean, the other thing I’ll say is that we’re in, you know, very regular contact with market participants all the time."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"It looks—it very much looks like the bill—so those bill purchases are going well, just according to expectations."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,So—but we don’t—we don’t—we’re not in that place.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’re not at this place, but if it does become appropriate for us to purchase other short- term coupon securities, then we would be prepared to do that if—if the need arises."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,We’ve also said that we were willing to adapt our strategy.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,We’ve said bills—bill purchases.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,I’ll take that now.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"Our strategy has been—essentially, the key to our strategy is to supply reserves in the near term through—through both overnight and term repo, and, at the same time, we’re raising the underlying level of reserves through bill purchases."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"We think that the pressures appear manageable, and we stand ready to adjust the details of our operations as necessary to keep the federal funds rate in the target range."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,And our—both our repo operations and Treasury bill purchases are intended to mitigate the risks that such pressures pose to our control of the federal funds rate.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,Temporary upward pressures on short-term money market rates are not unusual around year-end.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,So you asked about year-end.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s been very challenging to get inflation to be at target.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think, for the last couple of months, repo markets have been functioning well, short-term rates are stable, markets are functioning."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"Well, as I mentioned, actually, at the last press conference, we think our policy rate is appropriate and will remain appropriate as long as incoming data are broadly in keeping with our—with our outlook."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"And in order to move rates up, I would want to see inflation that’s persistent and that’s significant—a significant move-up in inflation that’s also persistent before raising rates to address inflation concerns."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"The follow-up to that would be, where are we with the possibility of a standing repo facility?"
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s my view.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"Now, you say, why is there confidence?"
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"It also means, though, that it’s not easy to move inflation up."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,That means that we can run at low levels of unemployment and have a historically good—in some dimensions—labor market without having to worry about inflation.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, by the way, that’s not a bad thing."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s just relatively weak.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"Well, it’s just that there is still, empirically, by many, many different—by the work of many different analysts, there is a relationship between resource utilization, by which I mean unemployment, and inflation."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"Given that inflation—whichever measure you choose—has either sort of remained where it is or not increased over the past year as you’ve been dropping the policy rate, what is it that gives you confidence that the Fed has the tools to get inflation back up to target or even overshoot as you just indicated that some people are considering doing?"
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,BRENDAN GREELEY.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"I will also say to you that a number of people wrote down, and you can’t see this at this level of detail, but—today—but a number of people did write down overshoots of inflation as appropriate—under appropriate policy."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I think what may be behind some of that is just the thought that, over time, it would be appropriate—if you believe that the neutral rate is 2½ percent, it would be appropriate for your rates to move up in that direction."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"In terms of those out-year rate increases, what’s you’re—you’re looking at rate increases more than a year into the future, and, you know, people will have their own explanations for why they do that, but we—really, none of us have much of a sense of what the economy will be like in 2021."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"And it hasn’t happened, and it’s just—it’s because there are disinflationary forces around the world, and they’ve been stronger than, I think, people understood them to be."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"The Committee has wanted inflation to be at 2 percent, squarely at 2 percent, for—ever since I arrived in 2012."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,Brendan Greeley from the Financial Times.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"We haven’t—we haven’t tried to turn it into some sort of, you know, official forward guidance."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think what you’re seeing is, you’ve got a full year of the median being flat, which is, we think, accommodative, modestly accommodative, and inflation not moving up very much, as we’ve discussed."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, I guess, how do we square that circle, with interest rates increasing before inflation ever really moves up in some meaningful overshooting way?"
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"Just following up on Heather’s question—so if you look at the SEP today, it looks like inflation is never overshooting 2 percent and is only getting up to 2 percent by the end of 2021, yet rates are increasing in 2021."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,Jeanna Smialek with the New York Times.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Chair Powell."
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,JEANNA SMIALEK.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,It happens to be my view that that’s what it would take to want to move interest rates up in order to deal with inflation.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,HEATHER LONG.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,I guess I’m wondering why it’s not sort of codified in a statement.
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,So is this de facto policy of the Committee then?
2019-12-11,Press Conf - Full Text,"And that underscores, I think, the challenge of getting inflation to move up."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s what’s going on in the Treasury repo market.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"So these are largely Treasury securities that have been purchased by dealers to—for distribution to—and buyers, to a substantial extent."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,And why make those changes?
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,So it’s just the financing for—for that.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Repo markets are important, because that’s where Treasury securities—the purchase of Treasury securities, which is the way—you know, the federal—part of the way the federal government is funding its operations."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s the way those are financed.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Now, again, we don’t—that activity is a—is a market activity."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,What can you tell us about what the Fed is considering?
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"What we care about is that volatility in the repo market can affect the transmission of—of our policy decisions to federal funds rate, and that really is important for the public."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Nancy Marshall-Genzer with Marketplace.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Chair Powell, is the Fed going to vote tomorrow on changes to the Volcker rule restrictions on banks investing in venture capital funds?"
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,This is a one-time thing that we’re doing to adjust the level of reserves so that the money markets will be able to operate smoothly on an ongoing basis.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,We’re not looking to eliminate volatility or protect anybody from volatility at all.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,And so we acted.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,It is the bottom of a range in which reserves will be expected to move.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,So we care that money markets are operating smoothly.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Well, let me just stress that we have a very specific and important reason for caring about money market operations generally, and that just is that we are—our monetary policy decisions are transmitted through the financial markets—through the money markets into other financial markets and into broader financial conditions."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"And how would you address criticism that it is helping mostly Wall Street, along with everything else?"
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"And so, how would you explain to, sort of, Main Street why you’re doing all this for that market?"
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, certainly, the repo market is also used heavily by hedge funds and other Wall Street institutions."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Clearly, they’re mostly designed, as you said, to get—keep the fed funds rate in the range you’re looking for."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,I just wanted to ask about how your balance sheet operations and repo—temporary repos—how they affect the system and who they’re helping.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Mr. Chairman."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,CHRISTOPHER RUGABER.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"And that means that reserves will move through in a range over the course of the year that will be substantially higher than $1½ [trillion], but they won’t ever go below."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,So $1½ [trillion] is not a target level.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"And they stopped operating smoothly, briefly, back in September."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Sure.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"And they’ve actually stuck to that even during this difficult period when they were experiencing, you know, strains from trade negotiations and that kind of thing."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,And we’ll be making a bunch of proposed revisions that we believe are faithful to both the letter and the spirit of the law.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,And that’s important that they do that.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"We learned that we can’t let reserves—we shouldn’t let reserves go below $1½ trillion—roughly, the level of early September—at any point."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"The authorities have stuck to that and have, again, continued to try to do that, so—to try to control the growth of debt."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"And that—as I mentioned, that’s one of the reasons why Chinese growth slowed, and it’s one of the reasons why global growth slowed, because we felt that."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,And a couple of years ago the authorities decided to try to get that under control—to stop the growth and to control it.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"For an economy at the—at the stage of evolution of the Chinese economy, they had very high levels of debt—not sovereign debt the way we think of it, but more business debt—debt of state-owned enterprises and also just private businesses."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Well, China has had a problem for some years, including from that period—2014 up until, I guess, ’17 or ’18, and I thought—which was essentially just a lot of debt for an emerging market."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"And how do you think it might impact the economy, particularly now that they’ve been hit by this unexpected shock?"
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"And the quote was: “There’s a tremendous amount of dodgy loans in China.” Now, I was wondering if you could give us an update on these problems in the Chinese financial sector."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"And the staffer said that there was a—what they were worried about was that not only was the Chinese economy slowing down, but there was the financial sector."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Just—in March of that year, there was concern about the Chinese economy, and one of your colleagues on the FOMC at that time asked the staff about how the Chinese economy would hurt—hit the U.S. economy."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,And I guess I’m basing my question on reading the transcripts from 2014 that came out earlier this month.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,I’d like to turn your attention back to China and the health of its financial sector in particular.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we will be looking tomorrow and voting on a—a new part of—part of the existing Volcker rule, and that is the covered fund provisions of the rule."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you, Chairman Powell."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,GREG ROBB.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’ll be—we’ll be getting comments from people, and we’ll be looking into that question, among many others."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, we’ll—we think that what we’re doing is—is very consistent with safety and soundness and absolutely consistent with the letter and spirit of the Volcker rule."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,And is there a chance that banks could take this and run and maybe even get involved in mortgage-backed securities again and risky investments?
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s the covered funds part.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s—so it’s that covered—so it’s not the proprietary trading part of Volcker.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s covered funds.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Now, is this just the venture capital funds, or are also you changing the rules for hedge funds and private equity funds?"
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Again, we believe that they will be—and you’ll see them tomorrow—will be public—you know, will be publicly—we have a Board meeting tomorrow to do that."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’re going to put those proposals out for public discussion, and we’re going to listen carefully, as we always do, to public comments on those proposals."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think we also found out, though, that the level of reserves that we need in the system to conduct our operations without frequent resort to open market operations was higher than we had thought and was higher than others had thought, too."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s good to wait.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,We will be announcing our findings.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,EDWARD LAWRENCE.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,But we’re very much attending those meetings and taking part in them.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,So that’s—that’s an ongoing question.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,We probably will do that at some point.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we’ve attended all of their meetings and taken part in them, and we’ve been looking at joining in one form or another and talking to them about that."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"And if I could follow up, can you clarify why the Fed hasn’t signed on to the Network for Greening the Financial System like 40 other central banks have?"
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,HEATHER LONG.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s not us.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"But I do think it’s—in that sense, it has to be part of our role, and—but not the overall response of society to climate change."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"And there’s quite a lot of work going on around the world at other central banks and at the Fed, too, to think that through."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"We are in the very early stages, as are other central banks, in understanding just what that means."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,And that latter part—I think the public has every right to expect and will expect that we will assure that the financial system is resilient and robust against the risks from climate change.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,And we haven’t—we share overall responsibility for financial stability with a number of agencies.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"All of that said, if you look at our mandate, we’ve got a monetary policy mandate and, more immediately perhaps, a supervisory mandate where we’re supervising financial markets, utilities, and financial institutions, banks."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, as I’ve mentioned, climate change is an important issue, a very important issue, but it’s essentially assigned to many other agencies in the federal government and state governments for leadership on that."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"I’d say, over—over the longer term, it’s certainly possible, and I would say that sort of feeds into the way we’re thinking about climate change as an institution."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"So that’s an interesting question—the question being, is there a systemwide financial stability risk?"
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Do you think there’s a systemwide risk that may—that could develop from climate change?
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"You’ve spoken several times that you think severe weather events are happening more often and that the Fed is monitoring what that could physically do to a bank or a financial institution, but that’s sort of one institution."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"I’m wondering, do you think that there is a financial stability risk from climate change?"
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Heather Long from the Washington Post.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,HEATHER LONG.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"We don’t have any urgency in making that decision, because we’re still trying to find that sort of stable equilibrium where we’re in an ample-reserves regime."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I think you—when you delay, you get more information by waiting."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Really, we haven’t made one, because we haven’t had to."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"And my thinking is, we will return to that fairly soon, and I wouldn’t assume a decision one way or the other."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"We don’t think that—that there’s any imminent risk there, although you—as you point out, the coronavirus thing is a significant thing, which will—will have some effects on the Chinese economy, at least in the short term."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, importantly, society’s overall response to climate change needs to be decided by elected officials and not by the Fed."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"I’m not going to give you a time, but we’re— we’re well along in that assessment at this time."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Edward Lawrence from Fox Business Network.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Mid- February, the phase-one China deal gets—goes into effect."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,I think—you mentioned other factors.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"We don’t have anything to announce here today, but I feel good about the—what we’ve learned there."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"And so we’ve undertaken that, and we’ve done a ton of work, actually."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,And we’d be prepared to adjust those in ways that might encourage liquidity to flow more easily in the system as long as it didn’t undermine safety and soundness.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"As for those forces, so, as we indicated, we would undertake a, you know, serious review of that question and look at both our regulations and also supervisory practices."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Yes.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"There seemed to be, you know—whether it was a one-off event, you know, too tight around tax payments and debt settlement, or whether there’s a more enduring issue going on with the market, more structural forces that are basically gumming up the repo sector."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Do you have any greater sense of what—what was going wrong with the repo market starting in September?
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Mike Derby with Dow Jones."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHAEL DERBY.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"We do not see a decisive recovery, but it’s possible that this mix of positive developments and also accommodative financial conditions could spur further growth."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"You could—you could well see manufacturing—as I mentioned, manufacturing PMIs have started to tick up consistently among both advanced economies and emerging market economies."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,There’s also the global economy.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,So there was a signing of a ratified USMCA at the White House today.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, I would say, we need to be a little bit patient about the effect on the economy."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I think, clearly, these are seen as positive developments going forward, but there’s a bit of a wait-and-see attitude—is this going to be sustained?"
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"So it hasn’t gone away, and we’ve just come through a round of talking to our vast network of comments— sorry, contacts in the business world."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,We still have two or even three active trade discussions that are going on in the public square right now.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Businesses continue to identify it as an ongoing risk.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"First, trade policy uncertainty remains elevated."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s important, though, to bear in mind a couple of things."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"A sustained reduction in uncertainty over time should improve business sentiment, investment, which would provide some additional support for the economy."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,And financial markets—the reaction of financial markets is very consistent with that perception.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Without question.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,So I guess I’d start by saying that the fact that we’ve reached a phase-one deal with China and the fact that we’ve moved ahead closer to getting USM[C]A agreed—those are potentially positive things for the economy without question.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Yes.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"If not, what will it take to get that business investment going as this uncertainty is—is being cleared up?"
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Have you seen business investment pick up at all?
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"The agreements have to be implemented, too, and that’ll take quite some time."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,The Chinese economy is very important in the global economy now.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, if—so many, many people benefit from low interest rates."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"We still have—you know, 85 percent of our economy is domestic."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,And are there any plans to codify some of these suggestions later in the year?
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"I wanted to ask, do you agree with his approach?"
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,I wanted to ask about Vice Chair Quarles’s recent speech on bank supervision in which he laid out some suggestions for making changes to the supervisory regime.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you for being here today.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Hannah Lang with American Banker.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,HANNAH LANG.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s about the views of the interested parties.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s not about our views.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s not about us.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s just not appropriate to do.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,And we’re not going to comment on the other proposal.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"We haven’t decided what to do, whether—going forward."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"As I said, we haven’t chosen to bring a proposal forward."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,So I do agree that—the principles that he articulated of firm and fair supervision and effective transparency in communications.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"I was comfortable with her speech, and I’m comfortable with the work we’ve done and with the Fed’s position on this."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,So we haven’t made any decisions about what we’re going to do going forward.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we haven’t made any decisions about what we’re going to do, about whether we’ll propose—I mean, our focus has been entirely on trying to get to agreement with the OCC, really."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,You saw Governor Brainard’s recent speech presenting some of the thinking and the analysis.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,We spent a lot of time on research and analysis and looking at meaningful reform.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’re sorry we haven’t been able to get there, and we still hold out some hope that we will be able to."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,We think that an interagency final rule together would be the best outcome.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,We worked very hard to try to get on the same page with the other two agencies.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s also just a good time to take on board the way the delivery of banking services has changed through technology and demographic change as well.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,And we think this is a good way.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,The law can both be more effective and more efficient is—it comes down to.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"So let me say that I think this is a good time to do—to update CRA, really, in a way that is a win–win both for the intended beneficiaries—low- and moderate- income communities—and also for banks that would like to have more certainty about—about what does and doesn’t qualify and that sort of thing."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,And is this something that we could see the Fed formally propose at some point?
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"I wanted to know, do you support Governor Brainard’s vision for the Community Reinvestment Act reform?"
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"In terms of, you know—Governor Brainard led our oversight committee over these activities for many years, and I asked her to take the lead on CRA modernization, which is a high priority for us."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Katy O’Donnell, Politico."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"I also think it’s a good thing that we would have brighter lines to define our LISCC supervisory portfolio, which we haven’t really had to date."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"So—and I also thought that, you know, the—he’s raising some very interesting questions about, if you—in the first part of the speech, where he’s talking about regulation and supervision and, you know, how to—how to balance the desire for transparency and due process in everything the government does with the needs of confidential supervision."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks very much.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s—those are our orders from Congress.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mean, we have to do what’s best for the—for the overall society and the economy."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"On the other hand, if you own a home, home values—the housing market has recovered, other financial assets have recovered, so—but, yes, for some people who are limited to those sources plus whatever other help they get, it can be challenging."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"If you’re living on just the interest in a bank or on fixed-income generally, then that’s a challenging thing."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"You hear quite the opposite, which is, you know, “Please do whatever you can to keep this expansion going.” I absolutely sympathize with people."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"In fact, you don’t hear—when you talk to the low- and moderate-income communities, one thing you don’t hear is, “You ought to raise rates.” That’s not what you hear."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,What will be the costs and benefits?
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,And part of that just is the effect of lower interest rates.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"That was—in the week [wake] of fairly modest growth, it was a powerful recovery in the labor market."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,So I think if you look— look at the time since the financial crisis.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Now, monetary policy is a blunt instrument, but it’s a powerful one."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,And that’s what—that’s our focus.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we—we are assigned a job by Congress, and that is to use our tools to pursue maximum employment and stable prices."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Remember that when a firm moves from one portfolio to another, that doesn’t mean that its level of scrutiny or supervision will change."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Sure.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,How much can you sympathize with them?
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,And how much would you take their plight into consideration?
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"What would you say to those individuals who’ve seen the Fed again cutting rates, eroding their ability to get a higher return on their savings?"
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"I wanted to ask you a question about the—one of the unintended consequences over the years-long low interest rate environment, and that is that savers haven’t gotten as much return as would have otherwise been the case."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Mr. Chairman, Mark Hamrick with Bankrate."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s not too good.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Sorry, I had it [the microphone] upside down."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Here we go.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,MARK HAMRICK.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"And as far as the specific, you know, proposals, there’s—you know, they’re interesting, you know, and need further development and will need lots of comment and that sort of thing."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s one that could use further thought.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s a very challenging question.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Hi.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,KATY O’DONNELL.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"So if you look at, overall—what you see, in my view, is, vulnerabilities to the financial—to financial stability are moderate overall."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Our current framework is one where we say—or we’d be equally concerned with deviations of inflation from target on either side.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,So that is a different framework.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Over time, an average inflation-targeting framework would be different than our current framework, in the sense that it wouldn’t be a—there would be some aspect of trying to make inflation average 2 percent over time, which means, if it runs below 2 percent for a time, it has to run above to bring the average up."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Over time—over time, though—let me take a step back."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,We think it’ll remain appropriate as long as data coming in are broadly in keeping with our outlook.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,We think it’s appropriate.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Well, as you know, we’re comfortable with our current policy stance."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"And whether or not we know the answer to that question, would the Fed consider changing the stance of monetary policy for that reason even if there was no change to the economic outlook?"
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Would a shift of focus to inflation over an average period—would that call for a different policy stance if you made that shift?
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,I wanted to ask about the framework review again.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Jean Yung with MNI.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Hi.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,JEAN YUNG.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,But that isn’t—that doesn’t suggest an intention specifically to have those deviations be symmetric.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s really the purpose of what we’re doing.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s not our intention to change the stance of monetary policy.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"In terms of effects on risk assets, as I said earlier, it’s very hard to say what is affecting financial markets with any precision or confidence at a given time."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I think, as I mentioned, we believe we can get to that state at the current pace sometime in the second quarter."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mean, in terms of liquidity, I think what we’re doing is what I said: We’re trying to raise the level of reserves back up to a level so that banks can meet their reserve requirements, and that there’s enough reserves in the system that we don’t see reserve scarcity, and we don’t have to use repo operations to provide additional reserves."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Well, so, two questions."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,How are you kind of thinking about that going forward?
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"I don’t know if that’s something that, you know, the Board or Reserve Banks are formally looking into or just looking at what the effect of it has been."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"So the combination of T-bill purchases and repo operations have been described colloquially as “liquidity.” I’m just wondering if you semantically agree with that description—then, secondly, what the impact of that has been on risk assets."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Brian Cheung here, Yahoo Finance."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Hi.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,BRIAN CHEUNG.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we have a much smaller external sector, trade sector, than other economies just because of our physical location."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"These were designed to provide more reserves and, really, to do that in order to enable better transmission of our—of our rate decisions into the economy under our chosen framework."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"In other words, that would— consistent with that would be having all the deviations be on one side, which is what we’ve had, actually."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I think it is a change in framework, and over time it would lead to a different approach to policy."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Again, I’m not trying to—I don’t want to comment on the current stance of policy, which we do think is appropriate."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"And the answer is, very stable funding, for the most part."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Are big financial institutions and other players in the financial system funded with stable funding, or is there a lot of run risk?"
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,The final factor is funding risk.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"So valuations are high, but not at extremes."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"And that’s also at fairly low levels, but not extremely low levels."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think the way to think about—a good way—one way to think about equity prices, though, is, what’s the premium you’re getting paid to own equities rather than risk-free debt?"
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"If you look at P/Es, they’re high."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"If you look at risk spreads, they’re narrow."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,We do see asset valuations as being somewhat elevated—I do—somewhat elevated.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"The other one is asset purchases, getting to your—sorry, asset prices, getting to your question."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"But we think it’s not something that would threaten financial stability, but more be an amplifier."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,And we’ve taken appropriate measures and are monitoring carefully.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’ve been calling that out for more than a year—substantially more than a year, and it’s something we’re focused on."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Business debt has been moving up.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"So not every household—but, in the aggregate, household debt is in a good place, a very good place."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s at low—low levels compared to what it was before the crisis.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s not moving up.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,DON LEE.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Don Lee with the L.A. Times.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,I wanted to ask you about the stock market.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"By historical comparisons, as you know, valuations are considerably high."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,And I just wonder how much discussion and concern you and your colleagues have about that and what risks you see for the economy.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, we—when China’s economy slows down, we do feel that—not as much as countries, though, that are near China or that trade more actively with China, like some of the Western European countries."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,So we—we look at a very broad range of financial conditions where—there isn’t any one financial condition that we—that we look at.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"If I can, maybe I’ll—maybe I’ll answer that in the context of our overall financial stability framework."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s one way to look at it.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we look at—when we look at financial stability, we look at—really, we’ve got four pillars to that, the first of which is leverage in the financial system that is at a comfortable level."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Our banks, particularly our large banks, have high levels of capital."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"The second is leverage in the nonfinancial sector, and that divides into households and businesses."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Households’ debt to GDP is—has been coming down since the financial crisis.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"And when we look at financial conditions, what matters for the real economy is substantial changes in—or, material changes in financial conditions that are sustained over a period of time."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, it’s really going to be a question of, how useful will it be?"
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Now, I think that’s got to be right."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’re going to return, I would say, fairly soon to this question."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’ll provide more details as we go, and we expect to learn as we go, as we always have."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Last points—we’re committed to making this adjustment process a smooth one.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,And we think that’ll be the case now that we made our technical adjustment.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,We also want interest on excess reserves and the fed funds rate to be well within the FOMC’s target range.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,We know that reserves will fluctuate and be substantially higher than that most of the time.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,So it’s not an—it’s not something that we’re aiming at all the time.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, most of the time, reserves will be moving in a range substantially higher than that but not going below $1½ trillion."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,We want $1½ trillion or thereabouts to be the bottom end of the range.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Reserves are going to move in a broad range, as I mentioned, and we want to be clear, that will be the bottom end of the range."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Effectively, what that means is that we need reserves at all times to be no lower than they were in early September—and, I would say, around $1½ trillion, subject to learning more."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"In particular, reserve levels will need to be at a level high enough to remain ample even when the TGA peaks during the April tax season."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Coming to your question, in terms of the actually desired reserve level, we know that reserves will continue to move up and down over the course of the calendar year in a wide range depending on volatility in nonreserve liabilities, particularly the Treasury General Account, or TGA."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,And we’ll continue to discuss that issue and review it under our implementation framework.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Even after we reach an ample level of reserves, it’s possible that repo operations might play a role as a backstop and support effective control of the federal funds rate."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,And we’re prepared to adjust the details of the plan as necessary to foster efficient and effective monetary policy implementation.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"At some point, we’ll also raise the minimum bid rate."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"As our bill purchases bring the underlying level of reserves up to an ample level on a sustained basis, the necessary quantity of overnight and term repo will gradually decline."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"And when we see that we’ve reached that level, we’ll begin to gradually reduce our asset purchases to the level of the underlying trend growth of demand for our liabilities."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Based on current projections, we expect that the bill purchases will durably bring the underlying level of reserves to the ample level sometime in the second quarter of this year."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we know—we will know when these adjustments have run their course when reserves are durably at a level that enables us to control the federal funds rate using our administered rates, the interest on reserves and reverse repo, without the need for frequent use of open market operations."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Money markets operated smoothly, including right through year-end, and the fed funds rate has remained in our target range."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, as I mentioned, these adjustments have been successful in supplying an ample quantity of reserves."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,We know that some volatility is normal and expected in well-functioning markets.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,It doesn’t mean we’re trying to eliminate all volatility in the repo markets.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"The purpose of the adjustments has been to assure that our policy is transmitted smoothly to the federal funds rate, which requires well-functioning money markets."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,And I will get to your specific question.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Just to review, those two adjustments were Treasury bill purchases of at least—of $60 billion—sorry—at least into the second quarter, and term and overnight repo at least through April."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, just to bring you back, after last September’s brief turmoil, we took prompt and decisive action, and a result—as a result, money markets have been operating smoothly since then."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Why don’t I say a few things about repos, since I know that’ll be of interest."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, thanks for that question."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’ve already begun the gradual reduction in the quantity of repo, and we’ll continue to reduce those offering amounts gradually as conditions permit."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Sure.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,STEVE LIESMAN.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Mr. Chairman, thank you for the question."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"I was wondering if you’d talk a little bit about whether you guys are noticing any cracks, or whether you’re worried about that, or how you’re thinking about it."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"As you mentioned, at the lower end of the sort of talent pool, it seems like we are seeing those wages climb up a little bit, but it doesn’t seem to be consistent across the entire sort of average."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’ve recently seen wages moderating a little bit by some measures, maybe even declining a little bit by others."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,I was hoping that you could talk a little bit about the labor market.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Jeanna Smialek from the New York Times.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Chair Powell."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,JEANNA SMIALEK.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, again, the last thing I’ll say is, we’re prepared to adjust the details of this plan as we’ve shown ourselves willing to do depending on conditions."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"And our plan as we do that is, as those purchases get to that level, we believe we can gradually reduce them, and we believe we can also gradually reduce repo as—as we reach an ample level, as we’re satisfying demand now more from underlying reserves from bill purchases rather than from repo."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,We expect that to happen during the second quarter.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,It is to return reserves to an ample level.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,What I can tell you is that you know what our intention is.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s very hard to say with any precision at any time what is affecting markets.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Steve Liesman, CNBC."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"In terms of what affects markets, you know, I think many things affect markets."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"I pointed out on other occasions, more than once, the differences—the really specific differences between this and the large-scale asset purchase programs."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,And that’s—that is our sole intention.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, our intention of these—for these adjustments is just to raise the level of reserves and to allow us to conduct monetary policy in an efficient and effective manner."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’ll know it because we’ll be able to be—to control the federal funds rate without use of—without active use, ongoing use of open market operations."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,But we will—we’ll know it when we get there.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s our estimate.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"So they’ll be much higher than that some of the time, but that’s kind of the number, and we think we’ll reach that sometime in the second quarter."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,And we know that the TGA will move up and down there.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I’ll just—I’ll repeat that—we think that the—we think we need to continue purchases until the—until reserves are at a level at which they will not go below $1½ trillion, roughly, during the course of the calendar year."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Are you concerned that the market is embracing this like a QE program, and that the rise in the stock market is linked to it, and you may then experience something of a “taper tantrum” the way Chairman Bernanke did when he tried to roll it off?"
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Secondly, a lot of people in the market are sort of concerned that it looks like QE, and they’re trading that way."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,I guess I’d ask one more time on Nick’s question—is there a number that you have in mind?
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Following up on Nick’s question, I know you said it’s not QE, but it’s $390 billion over five months, which is a lot to expand the balance sheet."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,We’ve been over that.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,And can you walk me through how you and your colleagues are arriving at that answer?
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,How many reserves does the Fed now think it will need to conduct policy in its current framework?
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"We will be monitoring the effects of the policy actions we took last year, along with other information bearing on the outlook, as we assess the appropriate path of the target range for the federal funds rate."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"As long as incoming information about the economy remains broadly consistent with this outlook, the current stance of monetary policy likely will remain appropriate."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"In particular, we believe the current stance of monetary policy is appropriate to support sustained economic growth, a strong labor market, and inflation returning to our 2 percent— symmetric 2 percent objective."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"We have seen this dynamic play out in other economies around the world, and we are determined to avoid it here in the United States."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"As a result, we would have less room to reduce interest rates to support the economy in a future downturn to the detriment of American families and businesses."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"In turn, interest rates would be lower as well—closer to their effective lower bound."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"While low and stable inflation is certainly a good thing, inflation that runs persistently below our objective can lead longer-term inflation expectations to drift down, pulling actual inflation even lower."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Available data suggest similar inflation readings for December, though we expect inflation to move closer to 2 percent over the next few months as unusually low readings from early 2019 drop out of the calculation."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Over the 12 months through November, total PCE inflation was 1.5 percent, and core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, was 1.6 percent."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Inflation continues to run below our symmetric 2 percent objective.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,These developments underscore for us the importance of sustaining the expansion so that the strong job market reaches more of those left behind.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Employment gains have been broad based across all racial and ethnic groups and all levels of education.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,People who live and work in middle-income communities and low-income communities tell us that many who have struggled to find work are now finding new opportunities.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"And wages have been rising, particularly for lower-paying jobs."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Of course, if developments emerge that cause a material reassessment of our outlook, we would respond accordingly."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Participation in the labor force by people in their prime working years, ages 25 to 54, is at its highest level in more than a decade."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Overall, with monetary and financial conditions supportive, we expect moderate economic growth to continue."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Nonetheless, uncertainties about the outlook remain, including those posed by the new coronavirus."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"However, some of the uncertainties around trade have diminished recently, and there are some signs that global growth may be stabilizing after declining since mid-2018."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Sluggish growth abroad and trade developments have been weighing on activity in these sectors.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"In contrast, business investment and exports remain weak, and manufacturing output has declined over the past year."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Growth in household spending moderated toward the end of last year, but with a healthy job market, rising incomes, and upbeat consumer confidence, the fundamentals supporting household spending are solid."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"The expansion is in its 11th year, the longest on record."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"We believe monetary policy is well positioned to serve the American people by supporting continued economic growth, a strong job market, and a return of inflation to our symmetric 2 percent goal."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"As always, we base our decisions on our judgment of how best to achieve the goals Congress has given us: maximum employment and price stability."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"At today’s meeting, my colleagues and I decided to leave our policy rate unchanged."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks for being here.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Good afternoon, everyone."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Transcript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference January 29, 2020 CHAIR POWELL."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I think it was wise to wait, because we’re still getting a better sense of what that— what that world looks like."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"The unemployment rate has been near half-century lows for well more than a year, and the pace of job gains remains solid."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Policy is not on a preset course.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,I will conclude with a brief overview of our current plans for our technical operations to implement monetary policy.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,The plan the FOMC announced back in October to purchase Treasury bills and conduct repo operations has proceeded smoothly and has succeeded in providing an ample supply of reserves to the banking system and effectively controlling the federal funds rate.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,How many reserves are “ample”?
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,I want to ask about the balance sheet.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,NICK TIMIRAOS.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s just that we wanted to underscore our commitment to 2 percent not being a ceiling to inflation running around—symmetrically around 2 percent, and that we’re not satisfied with inflation running below 2 percent, particularly at a time such as now where we’re a long way into an expansion and a long way into a period of very low unemployment when, in theory, inflation should be moving up."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, yes, there is something in that."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,So we thought about that in the intermeeting period and concluded that it would be appropriate to adjust that language to send a clearer signal that we’re not comfortable with inflation rising persistently—running persistently below our 2 percent symmetric objective.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"So you may remember, in the December minutes we noted that a few Committee members suggested that the language that stated that monetary policy would support inflation near 2 percent could be misinterpreted as suggesting that policymakers were comfortable with inflation running below that level."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, in making that change, our goal was, really—that was, changing “near” to “returning to”—was to avoid possible misinterpretation."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Yes.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Should we take all of this together to mean simply that the Committee is more confident that a 2 percent outcome for inflation is already baked in the cake, or that this is a signal that the Committee has a stronger resolution to bring inflation at least to the 2 percent objective and put—bring into play an informal makeup strategy for inflation?"
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,And I would put this also in the context of a comment you made at the last press conference where you drew attention to the fact that a number of policymakers had projected inflation overshoots two or three years out under appropriate monetary policy.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"That’s a slight change from the last time, when you were expecting it to bring inflation outcomes back near the objective."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,It notes that policy will be appropriate to bring—the Committee believes—inflation back to the Committee’s 2 percent symmetric inflation objective.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Mr. Chairman, I would like you to comment in a little bit more depth about one small change I’ve noted in the statement."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Chris Condon, Bloomberg News."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"In light of the resulting stability in the federal funds rate and money market conditions more generally, we decided to make a small technical upward adjustment to administered rates to ensure that the federal funds rate trades well within the target range."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,This action reverses the small downward adjustment made in September when money markets were volatile.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"As our bill purchases continue to build reserves toward levels that maintain ample conditions, the role played by active repo operations will naturally recede."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Over the first half of this year, we intend to adjust the size and pricing of repo operations as we transition away from their active use in supplying reserves."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"This process will take place gradually, and, as indicated in today’s FOMC directive to the Desk, we expect to continue offering repos at least through April to ensure a consistently ample supply of reserves."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Based on current projections, we expect that the underlying level of reserves will durably reach ample levels sometime in the second quarter of this year."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,The labor market continues to—to perform well.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"As we get close to that point, we intend to slow the pace of purchases and transition to a program of smaller reserve management purchases that maintains an ample level of reserves without the active use of repos."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,All of these technical measures are designed to support the efficient and effective implementation of monetary policy and are not intended to represent a chance—a change in the stance of monetary policy.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,We are committed to completing the transition to our longer-run ample-reserves regime smoothly and predictably.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Of course, we will continue to closely monitor conditions in money markets, and we will adjust these plans as conditions warrant."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you, and I’ll be happy to take your questions."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,CHRISTOPHER CONDON.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"At that point, as in the pre-crisis period, our balance sheet will be expanding gradually over time, reflecting the trend growth in the demand for currency and other Federal Reserve liabilities."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,The labor market continues to be strong.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,We see low unemployment.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"If we—if we need to make changes to keep it well within the range, we’ll do that."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,IOER is just a tool to do that.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Ultimately, what we’re trying to do is deliver a federal funds rate that’s well within the range."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,I think we’ll continue to adjust it to the extent it’s appropriate.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,We want it to be well within the range.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Don’t know that.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"So you don’t think that, as the fed funds goes back up towards the center of the range, that IOER is going to end up at the top?"
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,We are.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,BRENDAN GREELEY.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"So now we’re—now we are well within the range, I would say."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"With ample reserves, we see—we see that it’s possible to bring the interest on reserves rate up to 10 basis points."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, in hindsight, we know what was happening."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,We saw the—gradually moving up.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"It just means—I mean, the thing that matters for the economy is that we keep the federal funds rate—which is the rate that, of course, transmits into other money market rates, which ultimately transmit into all kinds of financial conditions—that’s what we care about."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Last year we were—we saw some tightness as reserves were draining out of the system.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,So that’s why we moved back up.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"And that, clearly, you know—5 basis points from the bottom or from the top isn’t that."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Well within the range.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s it.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,So our stated goal is to keep IOER and the federal funds rate well within the range.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,And should we see movements in IOER as an indicator that we’re approaching “ample”?
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Are we looking to get interest on excess reserves at the top of the band again as the fed funds rate moves to the middle of the band?
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, if you’re moving it back up, how high do you want to get it?"
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Over the course of the adjustments since last year, it’s moved steadily down, closer to the bottom of the band."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"As recently as 2018, interest on excess reserves was at the top of the band, sort of dragging the fed funds rate up."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Brendan Greeley with the Financial Times.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,BRENDAN GREELEY.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"There will clearly be implications, at least in the near term, for Chinese output and, I would guess, for some of their close-in neighbors, and we’ll just have to see what the effect is globally."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,You’re right.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Of course, we’re, as I mentioned, monitoring it carefully."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, ultimately, we will—we will use that tool to keep it well within the range."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Howard Schneider with Reuters.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,And there’s a range of views.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,We see strong job creation.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’ve had a couple of discussions about it, as you know, back in, I guess, June and October."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,We haven’t.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Now, we haven’t decided what that role is, we have not decided—we haven’t at all made a decision on a standing repo facility."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"In terms of the standing repo facility, as I mentioned in, I guess, in my answer to an earlier question, there may well be a role for repo in this system even after we’re at an ample- reserves level."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s January, and we’re several months away from— from that."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,But we’re not at that stage.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"When we—when we make decisions about the steps we’re going to be taking in that adjustment process that I described at some length, we’ll be making them as early as we can and as transparently as we can—and specifically."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,So I’ll go in reverse order.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Will there be preset amounts like you’re doing now, or will that just be something that people will have to sort of intuit and figure out as you go along?"
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"And the other thing is, on the, you know, on the standing repo facility and on the purchases—Treasury bill purchases, as you enter this new regime later in the second quarter or later in the year, will that be preannounced by amounts?"
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,[Aside] That was great.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Where do the discussions stand on standing repo?
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,I don’t think—I’m not sure your colleagues did.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,I did.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Did you hear the question okay?
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Did you get the question?
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Sorry about that.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Sorry about that.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,HOWARD SCHNEIDER.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Turn the mic over.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Can you turn mic over?
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,And also— UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"So if you could just, you know, let us know where that discussion stands."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Because what you’ve said so far sort of implies that there won’t be one or that it will be a limited one.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Just to sort of close the loop on one thing, where do discussions stand on a standing repo facility?"
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,[Laughter] HOWARD SCHNEIDER.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"And then comes the coronavirus, which, again, it’s too early to say what the effects will be."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,HOWARD SCHNEIDER.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"As I mentioned, we saw the fourth quarter of last year came in quite weak—weaker than expected."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’ve now had a series of—a number of FOMC meetings at which we’ve reviewed what we’ve learned and also dug deeply into strategy, tools, and communications."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"That was a very, very positive experience, and I think we learned a lot."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s included the 14 Fed Listens events around the country, at which we’ve engaged with a full range of people and groups across American society."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"I’m very, very pleased at the process so far."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,And we continued our discussions at this meeting.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"So this is about reviewing our strategy, tools, and communications to assure that they’re the best that we can do to achieve those goals in this environment on a sustained basis."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"So those are challenging conditions for monetary policy to deliver on our statutory goals of maximum employment and stable prices, although I would say that, under our existing framework, we’ve been able to succeed or get close to succeeding it for most of the time lately to achieve those goals, although we do struggle, as other central banks do, with the inflation goal."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"And some aspects of that new normal would include ongoing powerful global disinflationary trends, which have led to lower-than-target inflation many places in the world; secondly, a flat Phillips curve, by which I mean low levels of sensitivity of inflation to resource utilization—for example, low unemployment; and, thirdly, a much lower neutral real interest rate here and around the world."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"I’ll just say that we undertook the review because we felt, and I felt, that it was time to incorporate the realities of what we could call the “new normal” into our policy framework."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, as long as I’m asking, do you have any more details on when we can expect the results of the review?"
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Is that a fair or reasonable assessment of where you think you’re going to end up?
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"In terms of the framework review and a little bit on Chris’s question earlier, there is a general feeling now in the markets and among analysts that you’re basically setting us up for some form of inflation- target averaging where you let the inflation rate run above the 2 percent target for some time to make up for the time that it has spent below that."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Michael McKee from Bloomberg Radio and Television.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHAEL MCKEE.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Nonetheless, it represents more labor supply, and it may be holding down wages."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Very importantly, we see labor force participation continuing to move up, really, against expectations."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"If you go back a few years, you will not find a lot of forecasts suggesting that we could have been at 63.2 percent overall labor force participation or the levels of employment to population that we’re seeing now, let alone the unemployment level."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"We are not at all assured of a global rebound, but there are signs and reasons to expect it."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I think we’ve learned quite a lot of good things about the labor market, good things suggesting that there’s been more room to run."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"The performance of wages, I think, has to be seen in that context."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"We saw—if you go back four or five years, the four or five major wage statistics that we track were running at around 2 percent, and now they’re running at around 3 percent, which is theoretically about where they might be at full employment."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,I expect that we will conclude the review and announce our conclusions around the middle of the year.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,It would consist of inflation plus—plus productivity growth.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"So you asked, what can be explaining that?"
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, one thing can be that the natural rate of unemployment is still lower than we think, that the labor market is not as tight as it would appear just from the 3½ percent number."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"And the other can be, I think, that—as I mentioned, the sort of supply-side shock or surprise that we’re receiving from higher labor force participation."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"People are coming in to the labor market and providing more labor supply, and that is—that’s a great thing."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s a very healthy thing.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’re a country that has low labor force participation compared to essentially all of our advanced-economy peers, and it’s a very good, positive thing."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"The—it’s a bit surprising that, with sustained levels of historically low unemployment, we haven’t seen wages moving up above that level as we have in other long expansions and other periods of low unemployment."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Right now, we are just at the point of coming together to put all that together."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"What would you, Chairman Powell, think of that idea personally?"
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,There was a turn—downturn in the global high-tech manufacturing cycle in global auto production.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"The latest indicators—manufacturing PMIs, for example—suggest that manufacturing may have bottomed out, that they’re still below 50 in many jurisdictions, but they have moved up off of their lows."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"More broadly, though, if I can talk about the global economy for a second—and if you look at the backdrop, you know, if you go back to 2017, that was the year of synchronized growth that lasted into the middle of 2018, and then you saw slowing in growth, which lasted right through the end of last year."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"The fourth-quarter growth globally was quite weak last year, and a number of factors played into that."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,It wasn’t any one factor.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"There was trade policy uncertainty, absolutely, but also there was the decision by the Chinese authorities to try to rein in leverage and financial excesses."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"I would—I would just say, none of this is assured."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"I will just tell you that, of course, we are very carefully monitoring the situation."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"There were some idiosyncratic strains in some countries like Argentina, Turkey."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, all of those things were playing into that cycle of weakening growth over the course of 2019 and the last half of ’18."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"I would say, now there are grounds for what I would call “cautious optimism” about the outlook now for the global economy."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Many analysts are predicting a pickup in growth this year, although still to relatively modest growth rates."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I would—people are pointing to, and we would point to, supportive financial conditions, the easing of trade tensions, the lower odds of a hard Brexit."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,So I think I’m not the person who should be telling you my personal preferences right now.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"The high-tech manufacturing industry does appear to be rebounding well in Asia, including in China."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"And then, later, in Hong Kong and Chile, you had social unrest."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, in light of that uncertainty, I’m not going to speculate about it at this point."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, as you suggested, our framework ultimately is, what are the potential ramifications for the U.S. economy and for the achievement of our dual mandate?"
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Going back to your outlook for global growth, we’ve seen some significant headwinds, as you mentioned earlier, with the easing—with the partial U.S.–China trade deal, but now that there’s some new concern following the outbreak of the coronavirus—that it might shake global growth."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,There is likely to be some disruption to activity in China and possibly globally based on the spread of the virus to date and the travel restrictions and business closures that have already been imposed.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"First, it’s a—it’s a very serious issue, and I want to start by acknowledging the significant and considerable human suffering that the virus is already causing."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"So let me talk about the coronavirus specifically, and then I’ll turn more to global growth more generally."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Are you worried at all about what the impact would be on the U.S. economy, and do you see that as a significant risk—excuse me—to the outlook at this point?"
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Starbucks is shutting down close to thousands of stores.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Apple is rerouting their supply chains.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,We’re already seeing reports from Ford and Toyota that they’re planning to shut down their assembly plants for an extra week.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Of course, the situation is really in its early stages, and it’s very uncertain about how far it will spread and what the macroeconomic effects will be in China and its immediate trading partners and neighbors and around the world."
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Donna Borak with CNN.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,DONNA BORAK.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,I’m trying to—and we were trying to come together as a group around a set of answers.
2020-01-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"I feel very positive about—that we’re going to come up with some good results, and I’m just going to have to wait until we get to that point to announce them."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"You would want them to be regularly exchanging information—professional relationships not just at the, you know, the Chair-to- Treasury-Secretary level, but also through the organization."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,You would want the finance ministry and the treasury [and the central bank] to be talking in every major economy in the world.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,So those two things are—one for each of us.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"But in the middle there, there are areas where we—where we can cooperate."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"We have sole responsibility for monetary policy and strong instructions from Congress to conduct it in an independent, nonpolitical way."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"And also, there’s a long history."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"For example, the New York Fed is the Treasury’s agent—fiscal agent, as you know, so there’s a lot that goes into debt management and the issuance of debt, which happens at the New York Fed."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"So that’s a test we’ll be looking at, and I think it suggests that, you know, we’re going to be watching and willing to be patient, certainly."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"And there is—there’s also quite a lot of coordination in other respects with—of course, with foreign central banks, but you didn’t ask about that."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Okay, we’re going to go to the Washington Post."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"[Silence] Washington Post, are you there?"
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s just that—like that for us with monetary policy.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,HEATHER LONG.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hey, sorry, I’m here."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I think we do, actually—we have professional, good working relationships up and down the chain there, and, you know, that—that seems to me to be working."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s their job, with other parts of the Administration."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,CHRISTOPHER RUGABER.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"For example, the Treasury Department has authority over fiscal policy."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think—hi, Chair Powell."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"And if you—if you look at it, you’ll see that some things have to happen before we’d consider—we’d have to become confident of—that the economy has weathered these recent events and also is on track to achieve our maximum employment and price stability goals."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Okay, we’re going to go to the Associated Press."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, it’s Chris Rugaber at AP."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"In 2008, you had a lot of coordination between the White House at that time, the Fed, the Treasury—Bernanke doing a lot of things with Paulson and so forth."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s not our job.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, today the White House had its press conference at 5:00."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Is there—do you think it would be more helpful to markets—perhaps, in the broader economy, to have a more coordinated response?"
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Is that something we might look for in the future?
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Well, I would say this."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, we have different tools."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think we do, actually, work pretty closely with the Treasury Department and—and cooperate with them on things, with clear lines of delineation."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,You guys are doing something a little separate.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Two questions this evening.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"They hadn’t been filled out, and we—frankly, we spent our time focused on getting ready to make these announcements."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,If you could shed some light on the precautions you’re taking.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Chair Powell."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,This is Jeanna Smialek from the New York Times.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks for taking our questions.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"I’m just curious—you know, obviously, you held this meeting in lieu of your meeting later this week."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Will you still release a Summary of Economic Projections?
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"And if not, how should we understand how you guys are thinking about the economy as the coronavirus shapes up?"
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,JEANNA SMIALEK.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"So a couple reasons we didn’t do an SEP. First, we decided on Thursday to move the meeting up by three days to today, and that’s before the SEPs are generally filed."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Second, and, you know, a number of FOMC participants had already reached out to make the point that the economic outlook is evolving on a daily basis, and it really is depending heavily on the spread of the virus and the measures taken to affect it and how long that goes on."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,And that is just not something that’s knowable.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, actually, writing down a forecast in that circumstance didn’t seem to be useful, and, in fact, it could have been more of an obstacle to clear communication than a help."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, you can see, that’s the test we’ve written down."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"I do expect that we’ll return to the quarterly— regular quarterly cycle in June, however."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"So why no—I guess you’re asking, why no SEP, and what’s our forecast?"
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Okay, we’ll go to the New York Times."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,It is not something we’re actively considering right now.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, second, do you believe the Fed has sufficient tools at the moment, or are you seeking congressional action to expand your tool set?"
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,So I feel fine.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"I feel very well, and so there’s no reason for me to be tested."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"We are observing—we’re trying to model good behavior here, so we’re observing quite a lot of teleworking."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"And also, we’re—you know, we’re not having a lot of big, crowded meetings—we’re not having any big, crowded meetings."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,So we’re trying to observe all of the things that the professionals tell us to do.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,I do expect to do some teleworking because I want to model that—that it’s okay for the people to do so.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"In fact, it’s important for them to do so."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,So I will do that.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"In terms of our—of our toolkit, let me say first that, you know, I think we do have plenty of space to adjust our policy."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mentioned our liquidity tools—you know, we have a lot of power in our liquidity tools, and, as I mentioned, we’re prepared to use them."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"In addition, we’ve got plenty of space left to offer forward guidance, asset purchases, and adjust those policies, so I think we do have room."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"We—we have not at all made a decision to request further—further tools or authorities from Congress, no."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,We—we have not made that decision.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"First, have you personally been tested for coronavirus, and are you working from home?"
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"As far as—as the policy rate, what we’ve said is that we will maintain the rate at this level until we’re confident that the economy has weathered recent events and is on track to achieve our maximum employment and price stability goals."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Plus, as a second question, would the Fed consider buying securities outside of Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities?"
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’re going to go in strong starting tomorrow, and we’re going to buy across the curve, and we’re going to buy MBS, and we’re really going to use our tools to do what we need to do here, which is restore these important markets to normal function."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"We haven’t discussed that at the—at the FOMC, and it’s not—it’s not legal authority that we’re seeking."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Okay, we’ll go to the Financial Times."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,BRENDAN GREELEY.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you, Chair Powell."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,This is Brendan Greeley with the Financial Times.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"We are—of course, we don’t have the legal authority to buy other securities other than the ones we already buy, and we’re not seeking authority to do so."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,You have talked about the mortgage-backed security purchases and the Treasury purchases as a stability—a stability operation.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,How do we draw a distinction between these asset purchases and something you may do in the future that is explicit quantitative easing?
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Or can we think of this as the first step in quantitative easing?
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"So what—what I can tell you definitively is what the purpose of the asset purchases was, and I mentioned this in my statement."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,And it really is to support the availability of credit in the economy—households and businesses—and thereby support the overall economy.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,How do they do that?
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,I’m pretty sure that every person on this call has an editor asking to determine whether or not this is quantitative easing.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"We expect, with uncertainty, that, you know—that it will fall a little bit further, at least, below where it has been."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Again, it’s just an issue of inflation probably falling even a bit further."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,And it’s—it’s not a question—it’s not—it’s not an issue of deflation.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"In terms of the forecast, so, as I mentioned, you know, we see the U.S. economy starting out strong—from a strong position, different—different as we—as we talked through it today."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,EDWARD LAWRENCE.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Edward Lawrence from Fox Business Network.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"In your statement, you say that the market measures of inflation have declined."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"The Fed has undershot inflation in the last year, and that’s become one of the focuses of the FOMC meetings."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Now, does the Federal Reserve see deflation coming, and is this large cut meant to get in front of any more inflation?"
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Right.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, on—on inflation, you know, the—the economy’s performed so well, really, over the last few years, and right up through January: historically low unemployment—50-year-low unemployment for a couple of years, 11 years—almost 11 years of expansion so far, and yet inflation lingered below 2 percent."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,So we’ve been concerned that inflation not move down further.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s not at all a question of deflation.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"It was a question of not getting inflation up to our target on a robust, symmetric kind of a way."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, with this coronavirus arriving, we judged that the—the net effects of this will be to— to have inflation move down even a little bit more."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,They do that by supporting proper market functioning in the Treasury market and the MBS market.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"So you see—and I think you’ll see—as these purchases roll forward, you will see the Treasury market and the MBS market returning to normal market function, and that will actually support economic activity."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,That will be a positive for economic activity.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"In terms of what it’s labeled, that’s of less interest to me."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,I can’t read my writing.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,[Laughter] MICHAEL MCKEE.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,I was asking about timing.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,How long a period— CHAIR POWELL.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Ah, okay, great."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHAEL MCKEE.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"—are we talking about for the QE purchases, and how long do you anticipate keeping rates low, and how fast would you bring them back up again?"
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Okay, sorry."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,So that’s the “in coming months” language.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Let me tell you what we were doing there.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,So there’s no monthly cap here.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,There's no weekly cap.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"The Desk is going to go out, and it’s going to buy at a strong rate that is—that we think will restore market function—restore liquidity as quickly as it can be restored."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"And that language is open ended, and it’s meant to send a signal to the market that—that, you know, we’re not going to be bound by, for example, $60 billion a month or anything like that."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Just tell me.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,So that—that’s really what that is.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,What was the question again?
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"I really think we are very clear in our minds what we’re doing this for and what the logical effects would be, which would be— which would be both better market function and—and—you know, when there’s better market function, it will be—you know, policy will be supporting the economy better."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Okay, Bloomberg TV."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHAEL MCKEE.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,I want to ask some timing questions here.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"First, on the—whatever it is, QE or not QE, you talk in the press release about increase “over coming months.” Is there a timetable for that?"
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"How long are we talking about—$700 billion, obviously, over two months is a lot different from $700 billion over the course of a year."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,And do you have a date where you would reevaluate and perhaps add more or end the program?
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"And the same with the interest rate cut to zero—how long do you think that might last, and would you be inclined to quickly go back to a higher level, the 100 basis points or more that you cut it from?"
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Or would you anticipate that this will be a long, slow process going back?"
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Okay, so—sorry."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Mike, can you ask your question?"
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,What was it again?
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"People have a range of perspectives on the way the year is going to go, but I think there’s a pretty broad sense that the second quarter will be a weak quarter, with probably out—you know, output declining a bit."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,How much do you think they can put out—out to customer finance?
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,So the thing we do know is that we’ll be here doing our job and supporting the flow of credit and there to do what we can when the recovery comes to make it as vigorous as possible.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Well, yes."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"I would say, you know, that’s—that’s something that happens when markets are as volatile as they are, when you’re having these big market movements while markets are trying to understand what’s going on."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"They’re trying to reach a view on—in high uncertainty, and that’s why you see lots and lots of volatility."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think there’s more risk to financial stability in an era like—like that than there is when things are really placid, and, you know, we’re going home at 4 o’clock and kind of bored over here."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s not the case right now.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Are risks to financial stability rising, given all the stress that’s happening in financial markets?"
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, financial stability—I would say those—those risks do rise at a time of high volatility, particularly a time where we’re presenting—presented with a challenge that is—is kind of unique, really—it’s not something we’ve all done before."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,We monitor it carefully.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,We’ve built a very resilient financial system.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"The banks are highly capitalized, lots of liquidity, much better at understanding and managing their risks, their resilience to stress."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"So our financial stability focus—our focus on an event like this over the last 10 years will pay dividends, in the sense that you have a much more resilient financial system than you’ve had before."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Okay, we’ll go to Market News."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"I also want to add, though, that, you know, we’re strongly focused on financial stability."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"I’m sorry, the question was— VICTORIA GUIDA."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Financial stability risks—are those rising?
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Do you think there are some activities that FSOC might want to crack down on?
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,And are you confident that there aren’t any nonbanks that are systemically important?
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,FSOC is really something that the Treasury Secretary chairs.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,And it’s a big group—it’s got a lot of people.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,I think it serves a good purpose.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, you know, you should know that we are, of course, in regular contact with the other regulatory agencies, constantly talking about what’s going on in markets."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"There’s a lot of information and conversation on an ongoing basis there, I would say."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,So—and the same is true with our central bank contacts around the world.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’re in ongoing contact with all the major central banks around the world, talking about what’s going on."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’re having group calls, we’re calling one- on-one, so there’s quite a lot of information being exchanged there."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"And then, your question was, nonbank SIFIs."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, again, that’s a judgment for the—that’s a judgment for the FSOC."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"I—you know, I’m comfortable with the actions that we’ve taken, and if—if we do identify, you know, a systemically important nonbank institution, then we wouldn’t hesitate to designate it, but—although I guess now we’re working more on activities, but we do still have the power to designate institutions, so— MICHELLE SMITH."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Okay— VICTORIA GUIDA.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,JEAN YUNG.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, this is Jean Yung."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"I wanted to ask, a few days ago the Open Market Desk expanded its term repo operations, but the take-up was a bit low."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Is that—did you have any takeaway from that?
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Okay, thank you very much."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Could you describe any discussions you’ve had in coordination with the major banks—this whole talk of drawing down liquidity, drawing down capital buffers—how far can they draw it down?"
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Did you get explicit agreements for them that this will go to customer finance and not something else?
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"And then, secondly, is there any discussion yet of—of using the 13(3) powers of the Fed to do some sort of direct lending facility?"
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,We have given broad general guidance to the banks.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’d like them to use their buffers to provide—you know, to provide loans and—and also to work with their borrowers."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"As you can see, we’re providing a lot of guidance to them across a wide range, and they’re saying they have every intention of doing that."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s good to hear.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,And—so we’ll see how that works out.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"There—there are a lot of discussions going on, and, you know, we hear the banks saying, that’s exactly what they’re going to do, so that’s a good thing."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, we’re—of course, we’ve—we’re—we have nothing to announce on—on 13(3) powers, but, you know, of course, we—that’s part of our playbook in—you know, in any situation like this."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, as I said, we’re—we’re prepared to use our authorities as is appropriate to—you know, to support borrowing and lending in the economy, and, hence, to support the availability of credit to households and businesses."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Okay, we’re going to go to Fox Business."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Two things, if I could."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"With all the stress that’s showing up in different markets, do you see risks to financial stability rising?"
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Howard Schneider with Reuters.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,HOWARD SCHNEIDER.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Did that indicate to you that the repos were not working as you had envisioned it, or was there something else that you learned from that?"
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Yes, so we saw, and everyone saw, that liquidity had become very strained in Treasury and MBS markets, and we decided to offer very large quantities of term and overnight repo to address that."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"That makes it easier to finance the purchase of repos—sorry, of Treasuries and MBS."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we did that, and as you pointed out, the take-up was not as high as many had expected, and I did—we did learn something from that."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"We thought that was worth doing, and what we learned was that we needed to go direct here rather than trying to intermediate through the dealers."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"And so we realized at that point that we would need to actually purchase securities for our portfolio, so we did that on Friday."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"We bought—the next day, Friday, we went in and we bought across the curve, and we bought, I think, $37 billion worth of securities, and then we saw what happened with that."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"We saw that market function improved a little bit, but still it wasn’t what we needed."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"And that’s why we brought together the full FOMC and had our meeting this afternoon and announced these measures this evening, which are strong measures, with the broad support of the Committee to provide really substantial amounts of liquidity."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I—I think you can see us working through different solutions and—and finding the one that we think really will work and then acting quite vigorously, quite aggressively tonight to implement it."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Okay, we’re going to go to Reuters for the last question."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thanks, Chair Powell."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"After that, it becomes hard to say, you know, what’ll happen in the third and fourth quarters and thereafter, and it’s going to depend, again, on—on the path of the virus."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"I just wanted to ask, do you see a bigger role here for the Financial Stability Oversight Council?"
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Victoria Guida with Politico."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Yes.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"It was on what indicators you’re going to be looking at, financial and real."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Well, I think, in the very near term, we’re going to be looking at, you know, the Treasury market function."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’re really going to be looking to see that financial markets are returning to more liquid, more normal functioning."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,That is an essential part of our job.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,CRAIG TORRES.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"That is—actually, you know, that is the thing that central banks were originally designed to do, was to provide liquidity to financial systems in stress, so we take that job very seriously."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,So we’ll be watching that and we’ll be prepared to use our tools when and as appropriate to address—to—to support market functioning and really to support the flow of credit to households and businesses.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Those are the things I’ll be looking at.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, in terms of economic data, I think it’s just so early."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, we’re really looking—I mean, the economic data will follow the data on the spread of the virus."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, I think what happens—what happens during the spread of the virus is probably not going to tell you a lot about where the economy will be in six months."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s going to be— because you may have a—you probably have a bad quarter in the second quarter, but if things get better in the third quarter, that probably won’t matter so much."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s probably the most important thing we’re doing now is that.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,And your second question was—what was your second question?
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"But there could certainly be—there could certainly be, you know, a need for that."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,I—I think there is such a wide range of possibilities here that it’s some—it’s very hard to predict.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Okay.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Now we’ll go to Bloomberg News.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,CRAIG TORRES.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Chair Powell."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Craig Torres at Bloomberg News.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,You say the path of the economy more or less depends on the path of the virus.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,How important is fiscal policy now in determining whether this sudden stop in activity is long or short and of high human consequence or little human consequence?
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, second, can you talk a little bit about what’s on your dashboard for economic and financial indicators that you’re going to be watching day to day?"
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,I know Vice Chair Clarida said that we should start seeing the data show up in April.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"What are you going to be watching, and what should we be watching?"
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, in terms of fiscal policy, I think in the first instance—and you’re—you’re seeing some of this now—is the thing that fiscal policy and, really, only fiscal policy can do is reach out directly to affected industries, affected workers, and we’ve seen some of that."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, that’s—that’s an important job for fiscal policy."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"More broadly, after that, there’s the question of—of fiscal—broader fiscal stimulus, and I think that’ll depend on the path of the economy."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,We may be able to come back from that.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"If it lasts longer—so that’s really what I’ll be looking for, is—is what is going to be the spread of the virus and what’s the path it’s going to take and what are the effects on the economy."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Okay, we’ll go to NBC News now."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"And whether we succeed or—you know, that’s really the question."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I wouldn’t—I wouldn’t, you know—I’ll resist the impulse to guess."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,I really don’t know what that will be.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"In terms of the toolbox, as I mentioned, we think we have plenty of policy space left, plenty of power left in our tools, and I would point in particular to the liquidity tools."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"That, I think, is—is right now the most important thing that we’re doing."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Our interest rates will matter—cuts will matter now to borrowers who will get some relief from our cuts, but they’ll matter a lot more when the economy begins to recover."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,So—but in the forefront now are the liquidity tools and—and getting that job done well.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"In addition, as I mentioned, we—you know, we have room to provide forward guidance, to do more asset purchases."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,I think there—there is room for us to do what we need to do.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"I—I would just close, though, by saying that, you know, typically, fiscal policy does play a major role when—when there are downturns."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"You saw—you’ve seen that in many past downturns, and that’s beyond just the automatic stabilizers."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Sometimes fiscal policy comes in on a discretionary basis, and that—that will probably need to be the case here as well."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Okay, we’ll go to Politico."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,VICTORIA GUIDA.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"You can see that some countries have had a—have been able to, through aggressive measures and really high compliance—have been able to bend the curve and—and do that."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks for doing the call.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"And that will depend, to some extent, on how compliant people are."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s going to depend on a number of things.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,DAVID GURA.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Chair Powell."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,This is David Gura from NBC News.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"And a lot of good questions here, so I’ll—I’ll turn to one that’s more philosophical in nature."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,And you’ve talked a bit about the—the disruptions from the coronavirus outbreak and having lower economic activity for a period of time.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"I’m reckoning with fact that my kid’s going to be out of school until April 20 at the earliest, so we’re feeling this very, very acutely."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,But I wonder if you could just give us your perspective on the time horizon here and put that into some broader context—how you look at this and how anomalous this thing is with which you and your colleagues are going to have to reckon.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s my first question.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"The second is, you know, we’ve seen a variety of tools here deployed over these last few weeks, and the market—which I know is something that you pay at least minimal attention to— has reacted negatively to some of that."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,What do you make of that?
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Going back to the question that was asked earlier about the toolbox and—and what’s left—what’s left in it, rates are low."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Does that provoke any apprehension, any nervousness on your part that there are fewer tools therein?"
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I guess your first question is, how—how do we think about the time—the time for this thing?"
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know—and the truth is, we just don’t know, and, you know, the experts we talk to will say that they don’t know, and that it’s, in fact, unknowable."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"First, it’s the measures that we take to, you know, to—with the social distancing, and the—all the things businesses and school and everyone’s doing now."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"In response, we have eased the stance of monetary policy to provide some more support to the economy."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"You—you asked about fiscal as well, and I guess I’ve sort of covered that."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"As I mentioned, we do hear concerns, particularly from those most directly exposed, but there’s nothing in that nature: Financial markets are functioning in an orderly manner and all that sort of thing."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think when it—when it comes to those sorts of issues, though, we will be—the supervisors will be working with banks to assure that they work with their—with their borrowers and that sort of thing."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I can imagine us doing those sorts of things, but it’s—those things are not upon us at the moment."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,BRENDAN GREELEY.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Brendan Greeley, Financial Times."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,The economy continues to perform well—perform well.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Has the Committee discussed any other monetary policy tools, in addition to rate cuts, and the pacing and timing of when they might be appropriate?"
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Well, as you know, we’re in the middle of a review of all of our tools."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"So if you go back a few meetings, we’ve talked about what our toolkit is, and we’ve put that in the minutes."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"But in the current context, no."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"What we discussed is the current stance of policy, is it appropriate—came to the view that it was appropriate to make a change and went ahead and did that today."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,RICH MILLER.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Hi.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,There’s no evidence of it yet.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Of course, we are—we are thinking about what we can do should those things happen."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,So we don’t—we don’t see any of that happening yet.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,I would think it will be— it’s possible there will be some more—more formal considered coordination as we move forward.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"In terms of—in terms of moving forward, I would say that we do like our current policy stance."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,We think—we think it’s appropriate to—to support achievement of our dual-mandate goals.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"But as I said in my—in my statement, we’re prepared to use our tools—tools and act appropriately, depending on the flow of events."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,HEATHER SCOTT.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,But anything you’ll be particularly watching that would change that?
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,I can’t point to any one thing.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s always a range of things.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,HEATHER LONG.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Heather Long from the Washington Post.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,There’s been some rising concern about credit markets and possible insolvencies and defaults either from businesses or individuals from the coronavirus.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Can you speak to—is the FOMC talking about this?
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Are we likely to see any emergency provisions from the CRA activated or things that you normally do during, you know, a hurricane or that type of disruption to the economy?"
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Rich Miller with Bloomberg.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,And I think it’s up to individual countries—individual fiscal policies and individual central banks—to do what they’re going to do.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you very much for having a press conference.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, was there a discuss—some economists say this is a supply-side shock, you know, rate cuts are not particularly suitable for this."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Ylan Mui from CNBC.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Can you tell us what you would do if the virus ends up being contained fairly quickly?
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Would you envision the Fed actually raising rates in short order if the economic damage doesn’t occur the way that you potentially fear?
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I have a second question, which is, President Trump was just tweeting about you this morning and talking about the Fed’s need to cut rates."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Did you feel any political pressure to make this move?
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,YLAN MUI.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, you know, we’ll—if we get to a place where we think it’s an appropriate time to change the stance of monetary policy, we won’t hesitate to do that."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"I would also say that it’s—it’s very important that people understand that we will always make our decisions based on the best thinking we have, based on our—what we learned from our outreach to businesses, nonprofits, educational institutions that we get every cycle through the Reserve Banks, and the best analysis, the best research."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,We’re always going to make our decisions in the interests of the American people to carry forward and try to achieve the mandates that Congress has given us.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,And we’re never going to consider any political considerations whatsoever.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"We will not do that, and it’s very important that the public understand that."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,CHRISTOPHER RUGABER.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, on your first question, we’re always going to set monetary policy at a given time in a way that we think best serves our dual-mandate goals, and it’s as simple as that."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s why you’re seeing central banks around the world responding as they see appropriate in their particular institutional context.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"More specifically, it will support accommodative financial conditions and avoid a tightening of financial conditions which can weigh on activity, and it will help boost household and business confidence."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,But we do believe that our action will provide a meaningful boost to the economy.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Others say, well, the supply shock may morph into a demand shock."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,I wonder if you could just give us a little bit more depth on the reasoning behind the rate cut.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Sure, I’d be glad to."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,So the virus outbreak is something that will require a multifaceted response.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"And that response will come, in the first instance, from health- care professionals and health policy experts."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,It will also come from fiscal authorities should they determine that a response is appropriate.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"And it would be—come from many other public- and private-sector actors: businesses, schools, state and local governments."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,But there’s also a role for monetary policy.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Monetary policy can be an effective tool to support overall economic activity.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,We do recognize that a rate cut will not reduce the rate of infection.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,It won’t fix a broken supply chain.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,We get that.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,We don’t think we have all the answers.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Can you take us a little—through the reasoning behind the rate cut a little bit more in depth?
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,You’ve seen our action.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,I think within that you will see actions.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,We are going to use our tools—all of our tools in a strong way to—to try to support the economy.” So that’s a statement of general support.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,NICK TIMIRAOS.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Nick Timiraos with the Wall Street Journal.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Two questions.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"First, what changed between last week, when many of your colleagues seemed to indicate it was still too soon to tell how this might influence the outlook—what changed between last week and today?"
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"And then, how much confidence do you have that there will be a quick and relatively complete recovery of economic activity after the peak of this virus has passed?"
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you, and I’ll be happy to take a few questions."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Of course, we’ve been carefully monitoring the situation since it first became known and waiting to see how it would evolve."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,And I think we’ve come to the view now that this—that it is time for us to act in support of the economy.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"And once you reach that decision, we decided to go ahead."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"So what changed, really, was, I would say, over the course of the last couple weeks, we’ve seen a broader spread of the virus—we’ve seen it begin to spread a bit here in the United States."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"We do think fiscal response is—is critical, and we’re happy to see that those measures are being considered, and we—we hope they are effective."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,So we saw a risk to the outlook for the economy and chose to act.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, what changed?"
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"In the weeks and months ahead, we will continue to closely monitor developments and their implications for the economic outlook, and we will use our tools and act as appropriate to support the economy."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"As always, our actions are guided by our congressional mandate to promote maximum employment and price stability."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"We can and will do our part, however, to keep the U.S. economy strong as we meet this challenge."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Transcript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference March 3, 2020 CHAIR POWELL."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Earlier today the Federal Open Market Committee announced a ½ percentage point reduction in the target range for the federal funds rate, bringing that range to 1 to 1¼ percent."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,My colleagues and I took this action to help the U.S. economy keep strong in the face of new risks to the economic outlook.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,The fundamentals of the U.S. economy remain strong.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"The unemployment rate has been near half-century lows for well more than a year, the pace of job gains has been solid, and wages have been rising."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"These strong labor market conditions have underpinned solid household spending, which has been the key driver of economic growth over the past year."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"At the time of our FOMC meeting in January, prospects for continued economic growth remained favorable, and we judged that monetary policy was well positioned to support that outlook."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Since then, the spread of the coronavirus has brought new challenges and risks."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"The virus has afflicted many communities around the world, and our thoughts and prayers go out to those who’ve been harmed."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,The outbreak has also disrupted economic activity in many countries and has prompted significant movements in financial markets.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,The virus and the measures that are being taken to contain it will surely weigh on economic activity both here and abroad for some time.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"We are beginning to see the effects on the tourism and travel industries, and we are hearing concerns from industries that rely on global supply chains."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"The magnitude and persistence of the overall effects on the economy, however, remain highly uncertain, and the situation remains a fluid one."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Against this background, the Committee judged that the risks to the U.S. outlook have changed materially."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Of course, the ultimate solutions to this challenge will come from others, particularly health professionals."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,In terms of my confidence that we will return to—what was your question?
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Was that a question?
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,NICK TIMIRAOS.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,How do you expect this to—the economy to recover from this?
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"You saw this morning’s G-7 statement of finance ministers and governors, and I think that statement does reflect coordination at a high level in the form of a commitment to use all available tools, including health-care policy, fiscal policy, and monetary policy as “appropriate.” So, in terms of fiscal policy, again, not our role."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,We have—we have a full plate with monetary policy.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Not our role to give advice to the fiscal policymakers, but you saw the mention in the G-7 statement—as “appropriate” as well."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,HEATHER SCOTT.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,The G-7—Heather Scott with AFP.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,The G-7 statement seemed to indicate that—I’m sorry.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,I was away from the mic.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Sorry, Heather Scott with AFP."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,The G-7 statement seemed to indicate that—that policymakers would use tools but were not going to do anything imminent.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Does this contradict that, or is this in keeping with the action—the statement by the G-7 this morning?"
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, can I ask, what would cause you to make—take another step?"
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"What would you be looking for, in terms of the economic outlook or data?"
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"So the sense of the G-7, you know, is to—we have seven countries, obviously, and different policies, different situations, different mandates—a lot of overlap."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,And the sense of that is to get together as a group and say at a high level that “These are the things we’re going to do.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,And our action today represents what we think is the right policy for us in our particular institutional context under our domestic mandate.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Chris Rugaber, Associated Press."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Central banks are doing what makes sense in their particular institutional contexts, but we’re all talking to each other on an ongoing basis."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,I’ve been in regular contact with central bank leaders from around the world.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Do you see it as a persistent decline in activity or something that will be relatively temporary and short lived?
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,I don’t think anybody knows how long it will be.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"I do know that the U.S. economy is strong, and we will get to the other side of this."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,And I fully expect it will return to solid growth and a solid labor market as well.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,JIM TANKERSLEY.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Mr. Chairman."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Jim Tankersley, New York Times."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"You said that “the ultimate solutions” will come from others, and I have two questions about that."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"First, is this a coordinated—part of a coordinated action with other central banks, and should we be expecting to see more as part of that?"
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, second, what would you like to see from American fiscal policymakers in response to these new threats?"
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Okay.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, first question."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"We—we’re in active discussions with central banks around the world on an ongoing basis, as you would guess."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,That will continue.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,I know—you mentioned a little bit of outreach.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, for us, what really matters, of course, is not the epidemiology, but the risk to the economy."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Have you gotten reports sort of from the ground from your business contacts, nonprofits, and so forth that have affected your decisionmaking?"
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,And we believe that what we did today will be beneficial to financial markets generally.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"And as I said in my statement, we’re prepared to use our full range of tools to support the flow of credit to households and businesses."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Okay, thanks."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,We’ll go to Marketplace radio.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"I would point out that we have, of course, responded very strongly not just with interest rates, but also with liquidity measures today."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Chair Powell, I’m wondering, are you considering negative interest rates at this point?"
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Is there a scenario in which you think that would be appropriate?
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, as I’ve noted on a number of occasions, really, the Committee— as you know, we did a year-plus-long study of our tools and strategies and communications."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we, really, at the end of that, and also when we started out, we view forward guidance and asset purchases—asset purchases and also different variations and combinations of those tools as the basic elements of our toolkit once the federal funds rate reaches the effective lower bound— so, really, forward guidance, asset purchases, and combinations of those."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, we looked at negative policy rates during the Global Financial Crisis, we monitored their use in other jurisdictions, we continue to do so, but we do not see negative policy rates as likely to be an appropriate policy response here in the United States."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Nancy Marshall-Genzer with Marketplace."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,You also asked about other facilities.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"In the meantime, the Fed will continue to use our tools to support the flow of credit to households and businesses and support demand with monetary policy— ultimately, to do what we can to see that the recovery is as vigorous as possible."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,We do know that the virus will run its course and that the U.S. economy will resume a normal level of activity.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Mr. Chairman, how effective do you expect this—these actions to be?"
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Do you—do you think a recession is inevitable and/or can be avoided?
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Secondly, there was talk about additional programs that could come out—for example, a Primary Dealer Credit Facility or a Term Auction Facility."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Do you expect those to be announced soon?
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, based on our discussions today and many conversations with participants, it’s fair to say that we have a range of views about the path of the economy, as is always the case with the Fed."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, in general, I’d say that we see the U.S. economy as having been in quite a strong position before the arrival of the virus."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"We see that it is likely that the measures we take to protect ourselves from the virus will involve withdrawing from or reducing certain activities—thinking there of travel, leisure, hospitality, those things— and that’s going to mean lower economic activity for a period of time."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,These are choices that we make to protect ourselves—appropriate choices that we make to protect ourselves from the virus.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"So that means that the second quarter is probably going to be weak—in fact, in the view of many, output declining—output lower in the second quarter than it was in the first quarter."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"After that, it’s very hard to say how big the effects will be or how long they will last."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"And that’s going to depend, of course, on how widely the virus spreads, which is something that is highly uncertain, and I would say, in fact, unknowable."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Okay, we’re going to the Wall Street Journal."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,NICK TIMIRAOS.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thanks, Chair Powell."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,We saw that during the financial crisis.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"This is a very different situation, but, nonetheless, we thought it was quite important for us to take strong measures to support—to support proper market function in these important markets."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Now, you asked about households."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s true, we don’t have the tools to reach individuals and particularly small businesses and other businesses and people who may be out of work or whose businesses may not—may experience a period of very low activity."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,We don’t have those tools.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"We have the tools that we have, and we use them."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,I think we’ve used them quite aggressively for the benefit of the public.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"But this is a multifaceted problem, and it requires answers from different parts of the government and society."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mean, I think that, by far, the most important is the response of the health-care workers and health-care policymakers."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"After that, fiscal policy."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’ve had one round of fiscal policy, another coming."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think fiscal policy is a way to direct relief, really, to particular populations and groups."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Monetary policy has a role, and it really is in, you know—our original role was providing liquidity to financial systems when they’re under stress, and that’s—that’s really part of what we did today."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"The other role is to support demand through lower interest rates, and we did that."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Some of the Fed Bank presidents were talking about last week how much they were going to listen to their contacts.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we know that dysfunctional financial markets—a dysfunctional financial system, really, can have very big negative effects on the economy."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,STEVE LIESMAN.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"And if they are not functioning well, then other markets—then that will spread to other markets."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Now, why is that important to—to everyone?"
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"I guess I wanted to understand, specifically, how the actions you’ve announced this evening will get credit to households and firms that are going to see large drops in income and revenue."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"And also, to the extent that they are needed, what steps would you recommend the fiscal authorities undertake—again, to make sure that firms with large drops in income and revenue don’t go bust over the next few weeks or months?"
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"So let me tell you how, I think—what our tools can accomplish, and—and really what they’re not designed to accomplish."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,So what our liquidity operations—and I’ll talk specifically about the Treasury and MBS purchases—are designed to do is to assure the proper functioning of the Treasury and MBS markets.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"The Treasury market is one of the most important, perhaps the most important, market in the world."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s probably the most liquid large market in the world.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"The MBS market is very important: It’s closely linked to the Treasury market, and it’s the way that our monetary policy decisions flow through to borrowers in the real economy."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, two very important markets."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"And they had reached levels of very high illiquidity, and—to the point where we—as you know, last week we offered financing—very large amounts of financing."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"And after that, we bought assets across the curve to try to support liquidity and return to normal function."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we found that that helped, but, nonetheless, we thought we had to do more."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we knew what we had to do, which was the asset purchase programs that we did today."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,And those are designed to restore those key markets to normal function.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,These markets are part of the foundation of the global financial system and of the United States financial system.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"[Extended silence] Okay, CNBC."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,And those are the markets that—that amount to—that—where households and businesses typically get credit.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Please dial “star 1” on your phone to indicate you want to ask a question.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"These measures, which are essential for containing the outbreak, will nonetheless understandably take a toll on economic activity in the near term."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"While the primary response to this challenge will come from our health-care providers and policy experts, economic policymakers must do what we can to ease hardship caused by the disruptions to the economy and to support a swift return to normal once they have passed."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"The Federal Reserve’s role is guided by our mandate from Congress to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people, along with our responsibilities to promote the stability of the financial system."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Today we reduced the target range for our policy interest rate by 1 percentage point, bringing it close to zero, and said that we expect to maintain the rate at this level until we’re confident that the economy has weathered recent events and is on track to achieve our maximum employment and price stability goals."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"In addition, we took other actions to support the flow of credit to households and businesses."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Before describing our actions more fully, I will share how my colleagues and I currently view the economic outlook."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Families, businesses, schools, organizations, and governments at all levels are taking steps to protect people’s health."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,The economy came into this challenging period on a strong footing.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Job gains have been running at a solid pace, well above what is needed to provide jobs for new entrants into the labor market."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Participation in the labor force by people in their prime working years remained near its highest rate in more than a decade.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"And wages have been rising, particularly for lower-paying jobs."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Overall economic activity has been expanding at a moderate rate, even though weak growth abroad and trade developments have been weighing on some sectors."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"U.S. banks are strong, have high levels of capital and liquidity, and are well positioned to provide credit to households and businesses."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Against this favorable backdrop, the virus presents significant economic challenges."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,The unemployment rate was 3.5 percent in February and has been at or near half-century lows for almost two years.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"On behalf of my colleagues at the Federal Reserve, our first concern is for those who’ve been harmed."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,The virus is having a profound effect on people across the United States and around the world.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Today the Federal Reserve took a number of actions to support American families and business and the economy overall and to promote the flow of credit as we weather disruptions caused by the coronavirus.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,What are—what are you hearing from all those folks?
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,You will be unmuted when you are called on.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we’re—we are hearing—I would just say, the effects are at a very early stage."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"But you are hearing concerns from people—for example, in the travel business or the hotel business and things like that."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s—that’s what you are hearing.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,But you don’t see things showing up in actual data.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"You do see them showing up in, sort of, sentiment forecast indicators and things like that."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,It will probably grow.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,And that’s one of the reasons why we’ve come to the view that it would be appropriate for us today to move to support the economy.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,And that’s what we’ve done.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks very much.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Transcript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference Call March 15, 2020 CHAIR POWELL."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Good evening, everyone."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Like others, we expect that the illness and the measures now being put in place to stem its spread will have a significant effect on economic activity in the near term."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Those in travel, tourism, and hospitality industries are already seeing a sharp drop in business."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,We expect that will continue.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,The weakness abroad will also weigh on our exports for a time.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Because of the importance of the U.S. dollar in the global economy, strains in markets for borrowing and lending dollars overseas can disrupt financial conditions here in the United States."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"To guard against such disruptions, the Federal Reserve maintains swap lines with five major central banks."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"When dollar funding pressures emerge abroad, those central banks can contain the pressures in their jurisdictions and prevent them from impeding the flow of credit here at home."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"To address potential pressures in these markets during the current period of elevated uncertainty, we made a coordinated announcement with the Bank of Canada, the Bank of England, the Bank of Japan, the European Central Bank, and the Swiss National Bank to reduce the pricing on our dollar swap lines."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"In addition, our central bank counterparts will begin offering dollars to institutions in their jurisdictions for a term of 84 days in addition to the usual one-week operation."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,These long-standing arrangements carry no risk to the Federal Reserve or to the American taxpayer.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"I won’t go into detail on the other actions we took today, but they involved eliminating reserve requirements for banks and encouraging banks to make use of intraday credit with the Federal Reserve and to use their capital and liquidity buffers as they support lending to households and businesses."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"The actions we have announced today will help American families and businesses and, indeed, our entire economy weather this difficult period and will foster a more vigor—more vigorous return to normal once the disruptions from the coronavirus abate."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"We are prepared to use our full range of tools to support the flow of credit to households and business, to help keep the economy strong, and to promote our maximum employment and price stability goals."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Finally, let me note that today’s FOMC meeting today was in lieu of the meeting scheduled for next Tuesday and Wednesday."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,I’ll be—I’ll be happy to take a few of your questions.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,The Chair will now take some questions.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"In addition, the effects of the outbreak are restraining economic activity in many foreign economies, which is causing difficulties for U.S. industries that rely on global supply chains."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"To make the discount window more effective, we will also offer discount window loans for periods up to 90 days."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"The discount window plays an important role in supporting liquidity and stability in the banking system, and we encourage banks to turn to the discount window to help meet demands for credit from households and businesses."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,We will continue to closely monitor economic and financial developments and their implications for the economic outlook.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Moreover, the rapidly evolving situation has led to high volatility in financial markets as everyone tries to assess the path ahead."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Moreover, the energy sector has recently come under stress because of the large drop in global oil prices."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"The cost of credit has risen for all but the strongest borrowers, and stock markets around the world are down sharply."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"In the past week, several important financial markets, including the market for U.S. Treasury securities, have at times shown signs of stress and impaired liquidity."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,The market for Treasury securities is a critical part of the foundation of the global financial system.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Financial conditions have also tightened markedly.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,It is generally the most liquid of all markets and serves as the benchmark by which many other financial assets are valued.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Inflation, which has continued to run below our symmetric 2 percent objective, will likely be held down this year by the effects of the outbreak."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,It plays an important role in allowing households and firms to earn a safe return and manage their risks.
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"To prevent this from happening and to support the smooth functioning of the Treasury market, we announced today that we will purchase at least $500 billion of Treasury securities over the coming months."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Similar stresses have also emerged in the market for agency mortgage-backed securities, which is closely linked to the Treasury market and critically supports the ability of people to get a mortgage to buy a house or refinance an existing mortgage."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"To improve the functioning of this market and to ensure the effective transmission of monetary policy to borrowers in the economy, we will also purchase at least $200 billion of agency mortgage-backed securities over coming months and immediately cease the runoff of these securities in our portfolio."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"While the primary purpose of these securities purchases is to restore smooth market functioning so that credit can continue to flow, the purchases will also foster more accommodative financial conditions."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"The Federal Reserve announced a number of other actions today to support the flow of credit to households and businesses, thereby promoting our maximum employment and price stability goals."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Of these, I will highlight two."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"When stresses arise in the Treasury market, they can reverberate through the entire financial system and the economy."
2020-03-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"First, we reduced the interest rate on discount window loans by 1½ percentage points, bringing that rate to ¼ percent."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Because you talked about “soon”—you know, some businesses are in need now."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"In terms of fiscal concern, so I—you know, I’m—for many years, I’ve been, before the Fed, I have longtime been an advocate for the need for the United States to return to a sustainable path from a fiscal perspective at the federal level."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’re going to just provide the support that we can with the tools that we have, and we’re going to keep doing that until—until the recovery’s well under way."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"In terms of Main Street, so you know the story."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"We put out a term sheet, we got a lot of comments, we took those very much to heart."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Also, when does that Main Street lending facility get deployed?"
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,We’ve spent a great deal of time here.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s a challenging space, because it’s many different kinds of borrowers—they have different needs, different sizes of companies."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, so we don’t—we’re not in a position to make, you know, a reliable assessment of when a vaccine or a therapeutic drug would be ready, and so we’re not going to set our policies based on—on our estimate of that."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Now, given the amount of stimulus on the fiscal side and monetary policy side, how much weight do you give to finding a vaccine, from clearing that uncertainty you talked about around treatment and whatnot, for the Federal Reserve pulling back on some of the Fed’s actions and raising the rates from the zero lower bound?"
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Oh, yes."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,EDWARD LAWRENCE.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Okay, Edward Lawrence."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"But this is not the time to be—in my personal view, this is not the time to—to let that concern, which is a very serious concern, but—to let that get in the way of us winning this battle, really."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,And we absolutely need to do that.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"The time will come again—and reasonably soon, I think—where we can—where we can think about a long-term way to get our fiscal house in order."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,This is the time to use the great fiscal power of the United States to—to do what we can to support the economy and try to get through this with as little damage to the longer-run productive capacity of the economy as possible.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,This is not the time to act on those concerns.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"And so, we’re—as I mentioned, we’re very close to announcing a new term sheet, which will then become operative fairly quickly."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"We have not been on such a path for some time, which means—just means that the debt is growing faster than the economy."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Edward Lawrence from Fox Business Network.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"My guess is, though, that we’ll keep—we’ll keep looking to add products and add different kinds of borrowers to that as we go."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"And once that starts to happen, people will get hired back and unemployment will go back down."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"We, here, you know, we’re very much in touch with—with the urgency of that need."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"After the financial crisis, banks were instructed to up their capital so they could weather an economic shock."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"We have a lot to learn here, so we’ll certainly be trying to do that."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thanks, Mr. Chairman."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Scott Horsley.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, it’s—again, the path of it is highly uncertain, but we will—we will be there with our tools, supporting the economy and supporting that recovery."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"The main thing is to get into that stage where the economy’s healing, where we have the disease under control, where we don’t, you know, take too much risk of—of second and third waves and that sort of thing, and get people back to work."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Not faster than we can, but as fast as we can."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,We want to get that—that recovery going and get people back to work as fast as we can.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, I mean, the main thing we want is, we want to get back on that road."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think it will take some time for that to happen, for us to get back to anything that resembles maximum employment."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"I don’t think it’ll get anywhere near the historically low levels that we had in—as recently as February, 3½ percent."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,And we’re—we’re well aware of the importance of—of doing it as quickly as possible.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s, really, consumer spending has fallen precipitously."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"And the— so sometime fairly soon here, and probably gradually and at different paces at different parts of the country, we’ll see the social-distancing measures rolled back."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"When—and that’s because so much economic activity has been shuttered, really, as we take social-distancing measures."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,So unemployment’s going to go up to a high number in the second quarter—uncertain what the number will be.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Sure.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, at this point, what—can you just talk a little bit more about what you see as the path of employment in the coming months and into next year?"
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"I know you said that it’s highly uncertain but, you know, there are analysts who think that we’ll have very high unemployment until even the end of next year, as high as 9 percent."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,I just wanted to follow up on a question—the question on the labor market.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Chair Powell, it’s Don Lee from the L.A. Times."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,DON LEE.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Okay, Don Lee."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,People will begin to spend more money.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I’m—I’m hopeful we—we will very much try to learn as much as possible from that facility and from all the other ones, too."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Okay, Steve Matthews."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"And the second thing is, we won’t run out of money."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Chairman Powell, you’ve noted a number of times over the last year that there’s been a broadening out of job gains with marginalized workers, people who have been left out of the recovery over the 10-year period, finally making job gains, and—particularly minorities, but also many other workers."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Steve Matthews with Bloomberg.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,STEVE MATTHEWS.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,I think trying to be really precise about when that might happen and what the numbers might look like is—I think it’s very tough to do that.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"So the— the sooner we get the virus under control, the sooner people can regain that confidence and regain their economic activity."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,You would think that behavior will change as people gain confidence.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think then, after that period, at some point you will have—you know, the kind of formal social-distancing measures will—will be gone, but you’ll still be left with, probably, a level of caution on the part of people who will—who will worry and probably keep worrying for some— for some time."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Of course, this is the period as well that carries the risk of new outbreaks of the virus, something we really want to avoid."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Given the— given the size of the fall, the increase could also be substantially large, although it’s unlikely that it would bring us quickly, quickly all the way back to pre-crisis levels."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, as I mentioned earlier, that—that could be a fairly, you know, a large increase."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"But let’s just say, for this purpose, that it’s in the third quarter."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s very hard to say.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, when will that be?"
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’ll see unemployment go down, we’ll see economic activity pick up."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"People will come out of their homes, start to spend again."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, in time, this—during this period, the economy will begin to recover."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"So then we will enter this new phase, and we—we’re just beginning to maybe do that, where we will—formal measures that require social distancing will be rolled back gradually and at different paces in different parts of the country."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,And they’re a direct consequence of the disease and the measures that we’re taking to protect ourselves from it.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,We’re going to see economic data for the second quarter that’s worse than any data we’ve seen for the economy.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Unemployment moved up.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Personal consumption expenditures have declined sharply, business investment as well."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"First, this time, now, is going to be a time of sharp contraction in economic activity, high unemployment."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"But I—I will say, there—I think there are a few things that you can say about—about the path ahead."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,What kind of steps do you think we need to take for the economy writ large to make it more resilient to this kind of shock?
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Do you worry that this recession is going to fall hardest on those workers who’ve struggled and just got job gains in the last year or two, and that it may take years from now before there are opportunities for them again?"
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Yes.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s exactly what I worry about.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,I don’t know that.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,So I don’t know that the demand will be quite as strong as—as it has been for the PPP.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"One is, these are not grants, these are loans."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"This is different from the PPP, the Paycheck Protection Program, in two ways."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,So a couple things.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I was just wondering, for Republicans that are starting to get worried about how much fiscal spending they’re having to do in this crisis, you know, whether that should be a concern for them."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"And then, more broadly, you know, you mentioned earlier this year that the federal debt was on an unsustainable path."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"For the Main Street lending facilities, which will also work through banks, what lessons are you taking away from that?"
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,The Paycheck Protection Program has experienced some logistical problems because of the speed at which all of this is happening.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, I’m Victoria Guida with Politico."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,VICTORIA GUIDA.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, it’s not a limited pot, so there won’t be this incentive to try to get there first and that sort of thing."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Victoria.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, yes, that’s a very big concern."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think everyone is suffering here, but I think those who are least able to—to bear it are the ones who are, you know, losing their jobs and losing their incomes and have little cushion to—you know, to protect them in times like that."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I think it is important that we do everything we can to avoid that longer-run damage and try to get back to where we were, because I do very much have that concern."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,It wasn’t because there was something wrong with the economy.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"This is an exogenous event that—you know, just, it happened to us."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"All the more need for our urgent response—and also that of Congress, which has been urgent and large—and to do what we can to avoid longer-run damage to the economy, which is what I—I mentioned earlier."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"And it is heartbreaking, frankly, to see that all threatened now."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,All the data supported that as well.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,We were hearing from minority—low- and moderate-income and minority communities that this was the best labor market they’d seen in their lifetime.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we were in a place—only two months ago, we were well into—beginning the second half of the 11th year is where we were, and every reason to think that it was ongoing."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"And it tends to come down—come down faster as well, but it tends to go up faster and be much, much higher."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,So unemployment has tended to go up much faster for minorities and for others who are—tend to be at the low end of the income spectrum.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,It doesn’t have to be that way.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,SCOTT HORSLEY.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, we are—we set up the facilities, and we work very, very closely and successfully and collaboratively with the Treasury on this, but that—that particular aspect of it falls more to the Secretary."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"And so—but in terms of the—of the way to think about that money, I think that’s really a question for the Treasury Department."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,This is—this is a very unusual time.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,I think that’s what we’re supposed to do.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,And that’s okay.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, you know—but I do think we are—we’re clearly moving into areas where there is more risk than there has been in the past."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,And it stands in front of our losses.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"First, the Treasury Secretary really has—has authority over that, right?"
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"In terms of the—so in terms of the—the money, you know, the $454 billion, it’s a couple things."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,But we do have some tools to ameliorate that.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, nonetheless, there will be some of that."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"It doesn’t seem fair that people should lose everything they have, including their homes, over this."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"We won’t be able to limit all of it, but we do have the tools to—to do what we can to—to keep people in touch with the labor force and working and also out of insolvency, too."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"And so that’s why—as I mentioned, that’s why the urgency in doing what we can to prevent that longer-run damage."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, you know, longer and deeper downturns have had—have left more of a mark, generally, in that dimension with the labor force."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"So the longer one is unemployed, the harder it gets, I think—and we’ve probably all seen this in our lives—the harder it is to get back into the workforce and get back to where you were, if you ever do get back to where you were."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, in terms of the labor market, the—the risk to—of damage to people’s skills and their careers and their lives is a function of time to some extent."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mean, you know, what’s your tolerance for loss among that $454 billion?"
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Are you willing to use that to backstop, say, a program that is having more losses?"
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"It sounds like you want to keep that in reserve for programs that have high demand, such as the Main Street program."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Second question is just on the money from Treasury, the $454 billion."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"So are you worried about structural changes in job markets that would keep unemployment high and, therefore, potentially beyond the ability of the Fed to do anything about, which is something that was debated, as you know, after the last recession, and then eventually, of course, the unemployment rate did go lower than people thought?"
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,You did talk about potential loss of skills over time.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Okay, we’ll go to Nancy Marshall-Genzer for the last question."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Nancy Marshall-Genzer with Marketplace.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"So this is an unusual, new kind of uncertainty added on top of our—our regular uncertainty."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you very much.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,That means we’re—we’re not going to be in any hurry to move rates up.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’re leaving—we’re not changing that guidance today, you know, but it’ll be—that means we’re going to be very patient."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,So that’s where we are.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,We’ve said that we’ll keep our rates where they are until we’re confident that the economy has weathered the effects of the outbreak and is on track to achieve our—our goals.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Right now we like the place we are.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"But the—in terms of how long we’ll stay and under what conditions we’ll stay at the effective lower bound, those are just exactly the things we’re thinking about."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, we will turn to questions like that soon enough."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,I wanted to start on the unemployment picture and nail down a little bit how you see—how you see things going from here.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"In terms of how low, I really don’t want to speculate."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I think for the overall good of the economy, low interest rates are a good thing."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Low interest rates support employment, they support economic activity, and those are our mandates."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"But we—you know, we have to look out for the overall economy."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"But for people who are really, really just relying on their bank savings account earnings, this is—you know, that’s—that’s—you’re not going to benefit from low interest rates."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"If your saver owns a home or has a 401(k), your saver will benefit from that."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"They do—they do raise asset prices, including the value of your home."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"They make it cheaper to borrow, they make—they drive, you know, your costs of borrowing down."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Lower interest rates support economic activity through channels that we—overall, through channels that we understand reasonably well."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,So we think that low interest rates affect the economy through a number of channels in a positive way.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"And also, I’m wondering if you can give us any more of a clue as to how long you think we’re going to have interest rates near zero."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Chair Powell, I’m wondering what you would say to savers who are hurt by very low interest rates and maybe going into investments maybe in the stock market that aren’t so great for them."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"And that’s not to say they’re good for every single person, but that shouldn’t stop us from doing what we think is—is good for the whole."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Can you just say that part—you’re a little bit low volume.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,I guess I had two questions.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Chair Powell."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Mr. Chairman, given the demand drop, demand shock, and the drop in oil prices, do you anticipate that we might see any kind of deflation, even for a very short period, that would require a Fed response?"
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHAEL MCKEE.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Mike McKee.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"But we will need to—ideally, you would go into an unexpected shock like this with a—with a much stronger fiscal—fiscal posture."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Now, we have the fiscal capacity to deal with it, I believe."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, so we—we had an already high level of debt to GDP, and rising quickly, when this shock arrived."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,The U.S. really hadn’t—really hadn’t gotten back to where we needed to get on fiscal policy.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"I—I also think it—you know, it tells you the importance of—of getting your fiscal house in order."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"But there—there will no doubt be— with this—the size and force of this shock will no doubt reveal weaknesses in the financial architecture, and we’ll have to go to work on those."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"But I think—and we did plenty of things—you know, triparty—you know, we did a lot of reform in the capital markets: money market reform, triparty repo reform, central clearing, all these important things."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,And I don’t—I wouldn’t rush in with prudential regulation into the capital markets.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,So the breakdowns that we’ve seen in market function have really been in the capital markets.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, we worked hard to strengthen the banks: much higher levels of capital, liquidity, far greater sense of what the risks are they’re running and how to manage them."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, but I’d point to a couple of directions."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,And I think we’ll be at that for a while.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,We’re still trying to win.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,We’re still putting out the fire.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s early to be asking them.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,I—I think the time will come for a careful assessment of the answers to those questions.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,And a couple things come to mind.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, it’s an extraordinary, extraordinary shock, unlike anything, certainly, that’s happened in my lifetime."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,What kind of steps could we take to help the economy as a whole be more resilient to this kind of exogenous shock?
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Yes.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"If we get a negative print on CPI or PCE, how should people think about that?"
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"And second question—there is a disconnect, it appears, between the markets and the economic outlook right now."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I know you said that this isn’t the time to worry about moral hazard, but do you worry, with the size of stimulus that you and the Congress are putting into the economy, there could be financial stability problems as this goes along?"
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,CHRISTOPHER RUGABER.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Okay, Chris from the AP."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Particularly, the flow of credit in the economy has been a positive thing, as businesses have been able to build up their liquidity buffers and households have been able to be home—you know, people have been home, you know, concerned about their jobs, but they’re not concerned about the financial system collapsing as they were in 2008 and ’09."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,But I think it’s been good to see markets working again.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, we’re going to stay very careful, carefully monitoring that."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,So I think our measures have—have supported market function pretty well.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"That’s—that is really important for everybody, including—including, you know, the—the most vulnerable among us, because if—if markets stop working and credit stops flowing, then you see—that’s when you see, you know, very sharp negative—even more negative economic outcomes."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"The market is assessing risks, lenders are lending, borrowers are borrowing, asset prices are moving in response to events."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, you know, what we’re trying to assure, really, is that the market is working."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"That’s why you see volatility the way it’s been, market reacting to—to things with a lot of volatility."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"And that’s very, very hard to do."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Chris Rugaber over at AP, thank you."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’re not—we’re not focused on the level of asset prices in particular, it’s just—markets are trying to price in something that is so uncertain as to be unknowable, which is the path of this virus globally and its effect on the economy."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, needless to say, we’ll be keeping very close track of that."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"If— if low energy prices—very low energy prices were to—were to drop headline inflation negative, I—I would hope that people would see through that—and we’ll be monitoring it very carefully— would see through it, though, and look to core, which is a better predictor of future inflation."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think you asked, really, about headline inflation."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,So we’ll be there to work on that.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,And the Federal Reserve is strongly committed to maintaining 2 percent inflation over time.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, I would say, as long as inflation expectations remain anchored, then we shouldn’t see deflation."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"There’s been downward pressure on inflation, really, for several decades now."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"They have in other places in the world, though, over the past 25 years."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,And—but inflation expectations did not move strongly down here in the United States.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Inflation expect—inflation tended to move down a little bit, as it will when demand is weak."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"And during the Global Financial Crisis, there was a concern that we might see deflation, but it didn’t happen."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"In terms of inflation, we think that inflation is very closely and strongly related to inflation expectations."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"In terms of the markets, you know, our—our concern is that they be working."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’re not experts on those things either, but what the experts tell us is that the outcomes are highly uncertain."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,SCOTT HORSLEY.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Today they’re unusually uncertain, and that’s—that’s really because so much of the performance of the economy depends on the path of the virus and the success of the measures we take to control it, our success in reopening the economy, and also the time it takes to develop new drugs."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,So let me—let me start—I’ll take the questions in the order you— you gave them.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,And what policy tools did you discuss at your meeting today that might be used to stop a deflationary spiral?
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"I want to follow up on Jeanna’s question and ask, what specifically do you think elected officials should consider in order to help return or hasten a stronger return to full employment?"
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thanks, Chair Powell."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,NICK TIMIRAOS.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Nick Timiraos.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,But I would say that it may well be the case that the economy will need more support from all of us if the—if the recovery is to be a robust one.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"With enhanced unemployment insurance and the Paycheck Protection Program, we’ve seen an extraordinary, historically large reaction."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,And that’s appropriate.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think the answer to that—that will be “yes.” I would say, Congress has also reacted quite aggressively and strongly with the Cares Act and other laws—several other laws."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Will there be a need to do more, though?"
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,So we can continue to be part of the answer.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"They can be expanded as appropriate, and we can do new ones."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"As you know, our credit policies are not subject to a specific dollar limit."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I would just say, we have a number of dimensions on which we can still provide support to the economy."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"As long as needed, we’ll use them."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’re going to use them, as I mentioned, forcefully, proactively, and aggressively until we’re confident that we’re solidly on the road to recovery and also to assure that that recovery, when it comes, will be as robust as possible."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,So let me say that we’re—we’re committed to using our full range of tools to support the economy in this challenging time.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"You guys have cut rates to zero, you’re buying up huge quantities of government debt—I guess the question is, what more can you realistically do to help the economy, and where do you see a need for Congress to step in?"
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks for taking our questions.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Chair Powell."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"So in terms of, if I can say, legislative priorities, we don’t—we’re not responsible for fiscal policy."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,JEANNA SMIALEK.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Those will be decisions for Congress to make.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"They’ll come with a hefty price tag, but we would come out of this event eventually with—with a stronger economy and with less long-run damage to the economy."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"There are a range of potential paths the economy could be on, and I think as—as the time approaches for—then we’ll—you know, we’ll address your first question, which is about asset purchases."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,And we’re really waiting to see more from the economy.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,We’re not going to change it now.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"We think, for now, our policy stance is appropriate."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’ve had discussions, as I’ve mentioned, over time and done quite a bit of thinking about what we might do in the future."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, let me say again, in terms of—of asset purchases and—and other measures, we—we do think our—our policy stance is appropriate now."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"But—so don’t you have a series of programs essentially lending only to those able to repay, which is essentially helping those who may need it the least?"
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"The second question I have is, are—is the Federal Reserve really taking enough risk to help households and businesses here, in that you just said that the programs that are out there may be best for those who are able to repay loans."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,And—and maybe you could explain what the context is now of the purchases that will be made and the amounts that are to come.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"First of all, why aren’t you announcing or conducting a specific quantitative easing program?"
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,I’ve got two questions here.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Mr. Chairman, question—Steve Liesman with CNBC."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,STEVE LIESMAN.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Steve Liesman.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we’re doing those things, and I would say that we’ll continue to use our tools as needs be."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"With asset purchases, we’re continuing to purchase Treasury securities and agency MBS in the amounts needed to support smooth market functioning."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"As you know, we cut rates to the effective lower bound, we—and we’ve said that we’ll keep them there until we’re confident that the economy has weathered the effects of the outbreak and is on track to achieve our goals."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,We do think that our—our policy stance today is right where it should be for now.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"In addition, you know, we’ve had—we’ve had extensive discussions, as I’ve mentioned—done a lot of thinking about what monetary policy might look like over—in coming months over a range of potential scenarios for the economy."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,We can do more on that front.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"In terms of what we can do, I mentioned, we have our—our credit facilities are—are wide open."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"So that’s—that’s a key thing that—that, really, Congress could do over time."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"But I would say that policies that protect workers, businesses, and households from avoidable insolvency, that keep businesses going so that they’re able to produce goods and—and to either hold on to their employees or quickly rehire them, those are going to be key policies."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Jeanna Smialek.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you, and I’ll be glad to take your questions."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,We stated then and again today that we expect to maintain interest rates at this level until we’re confident that the economy has weathered recent events and is on track to achieve our maximum-employment and price-stability goals.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Last month we quickly lowered our policy interest rate to near zero.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,We are also committed to using our full range of tools to support the economy in this challenging time.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"The Federal Reserve’s response is guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people, along with our responsibilities to promote the stability of the financial system."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,The severity of the downturn will also depend on the policy actions taken at all levels of government to cushion the blow and to support the recovery when the public health crisis passes.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Both the depth and the duration of the economic downturn are extraordinarily uncertain and will depend in large part on how quickly the virus is brought under control.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Inflation is also being held down, reflecting weaker demand as well as significantly lower energy prices."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Overall, economic activity will likely drop at an unprecedented rate in the second quarter."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Manufacturing output fell sharply in March and is likely to drop even more rapidly this month, as many factories have temporarily closed."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hotels, airlines, restaurants, department stores, and other retailers have been particularly hard hit."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Household spending has plummeted as people stay home, and measures of consumer sentiment have fallen precipitously."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Millions of workers are losing their jobs: Next week’s jobs report is expected to show that the unemployment rate, which was at 50-year lows just two months ago, has surged into double digits."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"While many standard economic statistics have yet to catch up with the reality we’re experiencing, it’s clear that the effects on the economy are severe."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"As a society, we should do everything we can to provide relief to those who are suffering for the public good."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,It is worth remembering that the measures we are taking to contain the virus represent an investment in our individual and collective health.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"All of us are affected, but the burdens are falling most heavily on those least able to carry them."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"People are putting their lives and livelihoods on hold, at significant economic and personal cost."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Many businesses have closed, people have been asked to stay home, and basic social interactions are greatly curtailed."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,The forceful measures that we as a country are taking to control the spread of the virus have brought much of the economy to an abrupt halt.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"On behalf of the Federal Reserve, let me express our sincere gratitude to those dedicated individuals who put themselves at risk, day after day, in service to others and to our nation."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"The coronavirus outbreak is first and foremost a public health crisis, and the most important response is coming from those in the front lines in hospitals, emergency services, and care facilities."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,I would like to begin by acknowledging the tragic loss and tremendous hardship that people are experiencing both here in the United States and around the world.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks for joining us today.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Good afternoon.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Transcript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference April 29, 2020 CHAIR POWELL."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Of course, lowering interest rates cannot stop the sharp drop in economic activity caused by closures and other forms of social distancing."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,And low rates will not effectively spur the economy if those rates do not feed through to broader financial conditions or if households and businesses are unable to get credit.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,The economic disruptions caused by the virus created tremendous strains in some essential financial markets and have impaired the flow of credit in the economy.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Without access to credit, families can be forced to cut back on necessities and could lose their homes."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"We will continue to use our tools to assure that the recovery, when it comes, will be as robust as possible."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"When the spread of the virus is under control, businesses will reopen, and people will come back to work."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"At the Fed, we’re doing all we can to help American families and businesses weather this difficult period."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"This direct support can make a critical difference not just in helping families and businesses in a time of need, but also in limiting long-lasting damage to our economy."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"The Cares Act and other legislation provide direct help to people, businesses, and communities."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Elected officials have the power to tax and spend and to make decisions about where we, as a society, should direct our collective resources."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"In these cases, direct fiscal support may be needed."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"But for many others, getting a loan that may be difficult to repay may not be the answer."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,We can only make loans to solvent entities that the— with the expectation that the loans will be repaid.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,The Fed cannot grant money to particular beneficiaries.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,I would stress that these are lending powers and not spending powers.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"We will continue to use these powers forcefully, proactively, and aggressively until we’re confident that we are solidly on the road to recovery."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,So—but that’s not something we’re doing today.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"We are deploying these lending powers to an unprecedented extent, enabled in large part by the financial backing and support from Congress and the Treasury."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"In addition, by serving as a backstop to key credit markets, the programs can improve market functioning by increasing the willingness of private lenders to extend credit."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,These programs benefit the economy by providing financing where it is not otherwise available.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"We are also undertaking programs to provide stability to the financial system and to more directly support the flow of credit in the economy—for households, for businesses of all sizes, and for state and local governments."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"While the primary purpose of these securities purchases is to preserve smooth market functioning and effective policy transmission, the purchases will offer—will also foster more accommodative financial conditions."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,We will continue our purchases of Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities as needed.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"In light of this improvement, we have slowed our pace of purchases."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Our purchases have helped market conditions improve substantially in recent weeks.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"The markets for these securities play a critical role in the economy, and they came under great stress last month as the scale of economic disruption became clearer and as investors clamored for liquidity."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"To support the flow of credit to households and businesses, foster smooth market functioning, and promote effective transmission of monetary policy to broader financial conditions, we have been purchasing large amounts of Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,We have been taking broad and forceful actions to these ends.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Preserving the flow of credit is thus essential for mitigating the damage to the economy and setting the stage for the recovery.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Businesses can be forced to downsize or close, resulting in further losses of jobs and incomes and worsening the downturn."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Many of these programs rely on emergency lending powers that are available only in very unusual circumstances, such as those we find ourselves in today."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s—it’s something that we have talked about, and, you know, for now, we like our current policy stance."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Many borrowers will benefit from our programs, as will the overall economy."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"And there are a number of aspects under section 13(3), and you can see that they’ve permitted us to, I think, move very quickly and move into areas where we’ve never been before and do so quite aggressively."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,So we don’t see—we see our current stance and our current guidance—and I would say the same thing about asset purchases—we see them as appropriate.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,We’re going to wait until we’re—we’re quite confident that the economy is—is well on the road to recovery.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"And let me just say, we’re going to not be in any hurry to withdraw these measures or to lift off."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, you know, it’s not as though the market is pricing in a near-term liftoff or anything like that."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"We think, if you look at surveys, you look at market pricing, the market expects us to—to be there for a good while, and that’s appropriate."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"We got there essentially right away, and we think that’s the right place to be."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"We were the first to return to the effective lower bound, where we are now."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"So on the first, as I mentioned, you know, we moved very quickly, very aggressively."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Okay.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Then, on the credit facilities, what kind of demand are you expecting for the programs that were set up under the Cares Act, and are you expecting them to rapidly reach capacity like the PPP plan did?"
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,And is there any danger to delaying—delaying that plan?
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"And given the risks that you just outlined, under what circumstances would you strengthen the Fed’s commitment to keep rates at the lower bound?"
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,You didn’t firm up your guidance on—this is James Politi from the Financial Times—you didn’t firm up your guidance on interest rates at this meeting.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thanks, Chair Powell."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,JAMES POLITI.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Okay, James Politi."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"So it may take some time for us to get back—it probably will take some time for us to get back to—you know, to a more normal level of unemployment and—and, ultimately, to maximum employment."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"But the chances are that it won’t go right back to where we were, because people will—until they’re confident of—that the virus is well and truly under control, then they will be somewhat probably reluctant to—to undertake certain kinds of activity."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,It’ll begin to pick up as people start to return to their normal patterns of spending.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Consumer spending, as I mentioned, has gone down quite a lot."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,And probably the economic activity will pick up as consumer spending picks up.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"The next phases are more uncertain, highly uncertain, but we will go through a phase starting fairly soon where we begin to reopen the economy."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,We’re going to see that as a consequence of the virus and the measures we’re taking to protect ourselves from it.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"I’ve—I’ve also mentioned now a couple times that we have done a lot of thinking about what monetary policy might look like over coming months, and that would, you know, depend on—on where we are in—in a range of potential economic scenarios."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we—we were thinking about that all the time, but right now, for now, we think our current stance is appropriate."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,So we made no change in it today.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Second question was, how—so the thing about our facilities is, Treasury still has plenty of equity."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"In terms of risk, so, you know, we operate under the laws that Congress passes."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, as you know, economic forecasts are always uncertain."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Is that going to really lead us to a steady path out, absent a vaccine?"
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"And do you think a steady recovery is really possible until a vaccine’s developed, given the patchwork of measures we’ve seen taken around the states?"
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Is that now out of the question?
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"You said earlier, I think, that you thought the second half of the year could see a pretty robust rebound."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,I wanted to get your—a little more expansion on the timing of recovery and the—the connection between the health response.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Oh, hi, Chair Powell, and thanks for doing this."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,HOWARD SCHNEIDER.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Okay, Howard Schneider."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"The first is that, in the near term, we’re going to see, you know, significant declines in economic activity, significant declines in employment, and increases in unemployment."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,And we will follow through to validate that—that announcement effect.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we—for that reason, the ultimate demand for the facilities is quite difficult to predict, because there is this announcement effect that really gets the market functioning again."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"And yet there’s a tremendous amount of financing going on, and that’s a good thing."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’ve made the short-term money market loans, but—we haven’t made any of them."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,We haven’t made any corporate loans to—in those facilities.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Companies are out there financing, they’re out there raising liquidity."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,So that’s a good thing.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,And many companies that would’ve had to come to the Fed have now been able to finance themselves privately since we announced the—the initial term sheet on—on these facilities.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,And private market participants come in.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"The second thing I would say is—and you’ve all seen this—is when we announce these facilities—and I mentioned this in my remarks—it’s not just the actual lending we do, it’s the— we build confidence in the market."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"That’s—that will be unlikely to happen here unless we exhaust Treasury’s equity, and we’re a long way from doing that."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"So it won’t be the way the—the Paycheck Protection Program is, where there’s a specific amount allocated—appropriated for it, and—and then there’s no more money."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we’ve said that if—if demand for our facilities is greater than we’ve estimated, then we’ll expand them."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Of course, we have to follow through, though."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"I—you know, I would say, just on the U.S.—on the U.S. economy, there are things you can say, one can say."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,And we have the ability to do that.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,The third thing I would point to is just the global dimension.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Can you give any more guidance on how you all see this recovery taking shape?
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,That sounds like you all think this is going to be a long recovery—a long road to recovery.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"And the second, in the statement, you referred today—the FOMC refers today to a lot of medium-term risks from the pandemic."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Anything you can give us—a sense on timing?
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"The first, do you plan to launch the Corporate Credit Facility and the Main Street lending facilities in May or early May?"
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"I have two questions for you, both on timing."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Chair Powell, it’s Heather Long from the Washington Post."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Hi.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,HEATHER LONG.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Heather Long.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,We will keep using our authorities.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,We will—we’ll keep at it.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"We—you know, we can do what we can do, and we will do it to the absolute limit of those powers."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,And I—the reason I raised that in my remarks is that I just want to be clear on that.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,We can’t make grants.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,We—we do not make grants.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, it’s clear these are lending powers, and we are—we are ultimately bound to—to implement the laws that Congress gives us."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"And if you read section 13(3) of the Dodd- Frank—or, the Federal Reserve Act, and I know you have, it does require that—that we be secured to our satisfaction, and—and we can’t lend to insolvent companies."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Nonetheless, these are lending powers."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"And our tools, the things that we do, don’t affect any of those things."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,I think it’s appropriate that we are.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"This is a very global phenomenon, and you are—we’re seeing economic data from around the globe which is very, very negative, and that, too, can weigh on U.S. economic performance over time."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I—I think we’re going places and providing help in places where we never have, and I’m glad that we are."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,And you—I just want people to know that we’ll—we will be at it with—with the legal authorities that we have until we get through this thing.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Sure.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"But there are authorities that we don’t have, and there may be a need for those authorities to be used as well as ours."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Main Street facility is—we’re close to announcing—to issuing a new term sheet.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, in terms of those facilities, the corporate credit facilities are near being finalized and will be operating, I would say, soon—fairly soon."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"And if we see an unnecessary—unnecessary insolvencies, a wave of those, that could be damaging to the performance of the economy over time."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"They contain—you know, they’re job creators, they’re really important."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,They’re worth so much more to the economy than the sum of their net assets.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Another is just businesses—you know, these thousands of great medium- and small-sized businesses that we have all over the country."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"So that’s a—that’s a feature of deep and long recessions, and that’s something we’ve got to watch out for."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"The first is just workers who—if one is unemployed for an extended period, that person can—can lose the skills that are needed, can lose touch with the labor force, and have difficulty restarting his or her career."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,So that’s—that’s another risk.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,The second issue—and this is a very substantial one—is just the possibility of—of damage to the productive capacity of the economy through a couple of channels.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,So there’s—all of that is very much shrouded in uncertainty.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Will there be drugs that can either treat it or—or a vaccine of some kind?
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,How long will it take to get it under control?
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Will there be additional outbreaks?
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think, with Main Street, there’ll be at least a couple of different kinds of lending going on there."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"As you know, we put out a term sheet for comment a while back, and we got a couple thousand comments."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,We’ve carefully studied them.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,We’ve tried to reflect those in what we’re doing now.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,First is just the virus.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"It—this is a broad area of the economy with many different kinds of credit needs, so we’re going to keep at that for some time, I think, adding in sectors and lending products."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I think we’ll be at—we’ll probably be continuing to work and expand Main Street for some time, but it won’t be done quite as quickly."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"So the good news is that we have policies, as I mentioned in my remarks—we have policies that can address those things, but not perfectly."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"In terms of our statement, so what we said was that we—I’ll just read the sentence."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"It says: “[The] ongoing public health crisis will weigh heavily on economic activity, employment, and inflation in the near term and poses considerable risks to the economic outlook over the medium term.” So the “medium”—but what we meant by that, “over the medium term”—so, obviously, what we’re talking about is, you know, not right now, in the very near term."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s between now and the long term, so the next year or so."
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,And I would point to a couple of—of risks to the outlook that—what we were thinking of.
2020-04-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"But the first part of it, I think, will be done fairly quickly."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"We talk to experts, but—you know, so we don’t have anything special to add on that."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"That you—you can—that is something we’re going to do with all of our tools, and I think it may require Congress to help as well."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,On—you also asked about the second wave.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we—you know, we have major responsibilities and powerful tools, but the decision about when to reopen the economy is one for elected officials at the state and local and federal level."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, if they ask, we—we don’t have any particular expertise here at the Fed in pandemics or coronaviruses or anything like that."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"It may, but that’s going to be their decision."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"So it could hurt the recovery even if you don’t have a national-level pandemic, just a—just a series of—of local ones, of local spikes could—could have the effect of undermining people’s confidence in traveling, in restaurants and entertainment, anything that involves getting people together in small groups and feeding them or flying them around—those things could be hurt."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"So it would not be a positive development, and I’ll just leave it at that."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,We’re going to stick with this and support that until the work is done.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,Edward Lawrence.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,EDWARD LAWRENCE.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"I would just say, it’s—you know, it’s kind of self evident, I think, that if a—if it happens, you know, the—the issue would be, first of all, people’s health, but secondly, you could see a public loss of confidence in—in parts of the economy that will be already slow to recover."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, bottom line, I would just say, that—that—the key thing people need to understand is that there’s just a lot of work to do in the labor market."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,So those are two different measures of what’s happened.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,We’ll—we’re going to have to wait and see.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,You can add more on for the ones who were miscoded.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you, Chairman Powell, for the question."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,You can take the 21 [million]—people who have—had—are listed as unemployed right now.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,You can also take those people who are suddenly out of the labor force.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"You put those together, and that has gone up by about 24 million."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"So the question is, 20, 22, 24 million people—got to get them back to work."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"It is a—as I mentioned earlier, it is clear evidence of just how uncertain things are, and—and how humble we have to be about our ability to—to really have confident predictions as opposed to just predictions."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"Somehow, we’ve got to all, as a country, get those people back to work."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,So that’s the way I would think about it.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"And if—if you think we—I would just, in terms of the May employment report, it’s—it’s so nice to see."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mean, I think what people were thinking was that you’d start to get those back- to-work kind of numbers in June and July and August."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,Very few people saw them in May.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mean, almost no one saw that happening as early as mid-May, but it did."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"And so, you know, and we—we don’t know fully what that means, whether it’s just a timing change or whether it will prove to be much more than that."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"They didn’t do anything wrong; this was a natural disaster, and I—I really—I do think the responses so far have been great."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"On Main Street lending facilities, you know, in May we saw 55—at least 55 companies file for bankruptcy."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"Second of all, the future of these facilities—is this a one-year impact to the economy through these facilities, or is this a multiple-year?"
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,We’re going to be very careful about reaching any conclusions about—about good data or bad data.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,You can look at—at just the regular unemployment rate.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"So it—it is possible, but the thing is, we’re not going to overreact to a single data point."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, many forecasters widely expect a—a recovery over the second half of the year."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,We don’t know that; we’re going to see.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,I think the labor market—the evidence of one jobs report is that the labor market may have hit bottom in May.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"I would say that many forecasters had been expecting a bottom for the economy in—around the middle of the year, with—with a huge range of uncertainty."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"I wanted to ask, to what extent do you think you can factor in both disparities when you’re thinking about maximum employment?"
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"One is if we have hit bottom for the economy, and the second question is regarding the—the way that the pandemic has exacerbated racial inequality."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,So I have two quick questions.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you, Chair."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,JONELLE MARTE.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,Jonelle with Reuters.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,But our real focus now is on—is getting these facilities going and—and getting them to do the job that they—they need to do.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we’re, you know, we’re working on ideas for that."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"If so, how many years?"
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"We have, you know, significant interest, we think."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"And also, remember, lots and lots of companies are getting financed, too."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,The—the banks are lending.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,The markets are open.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"Do you think that it is too late, first of all?"
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, you have a—a—a much better lending climate than—than certainly than we had in February and March."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,We—we— and we do expect it to be up quite soon.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"In terms of the timing of these things, so, you know, we’ll leave them open as—we’ll leave them open for new loans as long as they need to."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"That’ll be a decision we make, of course, with our colleagues at the Treasury Department."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, at a certain point, there won’t be a need for further loans, and—and then the assets will—will be there."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"And so if that’s—I don’t know if that’s a part of your question too, but I would just say that, at that point, you know, the—the useful role of the—of the Federal Reserve is probably close to an end at that point."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"We don’t have any expertise in managing pools of credit assets, loans—if you will—or bonds, and we, you know, we don’t want to be made—we don’t really want to be part of the decisions that have to be made to manage such a portfolio, so we’d be looking to have that done either someplace else or, you know, by—by a third party or at the Treasury Department or something."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"We don’t think it’s too late, though."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,You can get at it a different way.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,Okay.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,That—that amounts to 22 million additional people who are—who’ve—who’ve lost work in the economy either by going to part time or something like that.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"You—you get to—the question is, it’s big—everyone can see that it’s big."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"So it’s—so far, it’s a good response, and it’s having—it’s having a big effect."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,Many are giving the PPP credit on that front and—and in keeping small businesses going.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,I think you’re seeing it in the job market data.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,The expanded unemployment insurance and also the stimulus checks have gone a long way to replacing lost income from—from job loss.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,You look at the income data.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"If you put those together, all of that is making a difference now."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"Those programs—by the way, let me add: The Fed also—we both innovated and acted forcefully, progressively, proactively, and aggressively as well."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, the—both the PPP and the unemployment insurance are quite innovative in the American context, and there were difficulties in implementing it, but that’s really a function of—of their novelty, I think."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"It is—it’s in a class by itself, in terms of both the size and the speed of it, and it’s also pretty innovative."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"Roughly $3 trillion Congress has authorized, and that’s benefiting households; laid-off workers; small, medium, and large businesses; hospitals; state and local governments—14 percent of GDP."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, appropriately, the response from fiscal authorities has been large, forceful, and very quick by—by the standards of these things."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,Extraordinary.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"We went from the lowest level of employ—unemployment in 50 years to the highest level in close to 90 years, and we did it in two months."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think we try to keep our comments on fiscal policy at a high level, and I’ll—I’ll come to your specific question, but I would just say this: This is the biggest economic shock in the U.S. and in the world, really, in living memory."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"I know you’re loathe to weigh in too heavily on fiscal policy, but given your forecast for elevated unemployment rates, do you think it’s important that Congress extend the $600 a week extra unemployment benefits?"
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, I think, you know, we’re going to be here with our tools supporting this economy for as long as it’s needed."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"And with many of those set to expire soon and many businesses and households still in dire financial straits, I’m wondering if any consideration is being given at the Fed to more comprehensive regulatory forbearance measures or other regulatory measures to prevent businesses from going under just because they can’t meet those payments."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"There have, of course, been some tweaks to the Paycheck Protection Program on the fiscal side to address this, but I wanted to ask you about things you might be able to do on the regulatory side as well."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,We can—we can make changes to bank regulation and supervision.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,Is it going to be big enough?
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"I don’t know that we have the ability to make changes, for example, in mortgage payments, if that’s what you’re thinking of, or credit card payments."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"There’s been a tremendous amount of forbearance on the part of the banks, and I guess our role there would be to encourage it, but those are not decisions that we hold any legal authority to make, and we—by the way, we have encouraged those decisions."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,I hope that’s responsive to your question.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.

2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,SCOTT HORSLEY.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"That’s really—that’s something that could be legislative, or it could just be what the—what the banks themselves are doing."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"So that’s in the low 20s, and that’s post the May employment report."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,And that—that is the question.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’re—we’re—we’re doing a fair job of getting through these first few months, more than a fair job."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"So in—in—in U-6, the U-6 level of unemployment has tripled from 7 percent to 21 percent."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,And the—the one that has a much broader measurement of slack in the economy is U-6.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"And the U—that’s the— the one we look—talk about all the time is called U-3, by economists."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"I can’t offer any advice, but I will provide a little context for the— for—I want to be clear about the picture—one way to look at the picture, really, and that is this: You can—you can get at this by looking at, you know, the—the—the widest measure of unemployment, of labor market slack, if you will, is the U-6 measure."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"How problematic is that from a policy perspective, not having agreement on what it means to have defeated this virus or gotten to a place where the economy can get through this?"
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"And you have an Administration now inclined to, if not direct, be content with states opening up their economies perhaps too early."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"It seems to me, as I listen to the chatter coming from the White House and from politicians and epidemiologists, there isn’t agreement on what “getting through this” means."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,You’ve talked about us weathering this crisis and getting through this storm.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"You’ve talked a lot about your fear of a second wave of this disease, and it strikes me, there’s a—a difficulty here with definition."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"And a quick second question, if I could."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"I wonder if you worry that that sense of urgency isn’t being matched and—and what the consequences of that might be, if there’s a fear that the Fed could be seen as a Cassandra here as we look at that unemployment report and then through the summer, and you have more and more politicians inclined just to wait and see what happens here in—in subsequent reports."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"Indeed, we’ve seen that from the Federal Reserve."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"Your—your message throughout this crisis has been one of how unprecedented it is, about how much urgency there is in dealing with this."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"But if you were to find yourself in a—in a senator’s office suite, and he held up that May unemployment report, which you’ve described as unexpectedly positive and—and a welcome surprise, and if he or she said to you, “Look, this is an indication that we can put on the breaks,” I wonder what you would say."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I’m going to try a hypothetical here, and you can rebuff it if— if you want."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"You have been studious about threading this needle in the interviews that you’ve given and speeches and the—the colloquy that’s followed, not giving advice to Congress but indicating that there’s likely to be a need for more fiscal stimulus or additional policy in the future."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"The question, though, is, that group of people who won’t be able to go back to work quickly, what about them?"
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"And that could be many millions of people, you know, parts— who worked in parts of the economy that will be the slow ones to recover."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, we want those people back in the labor force."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,We want them getting jobs.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,So—and—and they’re going to need possibly—probably will need further support.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"In terms of the $600 unemployment insurance, I wouldn’t—I wouldn’t try to give Congress advice on the specifics of that."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"And—and the question for—for—the question that I’ve been concerned about, really, is this issue of longer-run damage to the economy."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"I—I know they’re looking at—I mean, I—I know from both talking to people and—and reading the papers that they’re looking at a whole bunch of different possible approaches going forward, and some of those seem kind of promising."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,David Gura.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,DAVID GURA.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you, Chair Powell."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,I’m going to pick up on what Scott Horsley was asking just a moment ago.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, you know, we’re happy to give advice if people ask for it but—but probably not—not publicly."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"So—but I think there’s a possibility that—that the bottom has come in the labor market, but we don’t know that yet."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,So we—we’re not looking to achieve a particular level of any asset price.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, in terms of the—you know, the effect of the pandemic on inequality, what you see— the pandemic, of course, hits everybody, but in an economic sense, it hits those industries that are—that involve groups of people in tight groups, either in places where they’re—it’s the travel, leisure, restaurant, bars, those kinds of service-economy jobs."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,And I’m wondering if you think there is some tweak or some message you could give that would affect that.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"And a number of studies have suggested that by keeping rates low for so long and targeting the markets after the great financial crisis, that the Fed did contribute to wealth inequality in this country."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"Second, inequality is not just about wages, it’s also about wealth."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I’m wondering, given the levels of the market right now, whether you or your colleagues feel there is a possible bubble blowing that could pop and set back the recovery significantly, or that we might see capital misallocation that will leave us worse off when this is over."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"Since your March 23 emergency announcement, every single stock in the S&P 500 has delivered a positive return."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,I came across a statistic the other day that amazed me.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"Mr. Chairman, Michael McKee, Bloomberg Television and Radio."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHAEL MCKEE.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"For the last question, we’ll go to Michael McKee with Bloomberg TV."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, obviously, that’s something that’s going to require an all-of-society, all-of-government response."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, you know, we—we call it out as a—as an important factor in the economy, and we will use our tools to support maximum employment and take that, you know, definition to heart."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"If you look more in the middle, then it’s—then—then it has gone up for most other groups, but at the bottom, not so much in real terms, in inflation-adjusted terms."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"And wages for the bottom, you know, 10 percent really haven’t gone up in real terms in a very long time, and—over a long period of time, whereas wages for the people at the top, compensation, any way you cut it—before taxes, after taxes, after transfers, all of those, any way you cut it—wages have—compensation has gone up a whole lot for people at the top, and it really hasn’t gone up for people at the bottom."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"If you’re not, then your wages are going to stagnate."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mean, I know that you said you don’t target certain groups, but is there a way that you could use, for example, the black unemployment rate as—as some kind of a benchmark to something you’d want to meet or something that you’d keep track of?"
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,We do.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"We do track all unemployment by all kinds, as you know— all kinds of different demographics, including particularly the African American unemployment rate, which reached an all-time low since the data started being kept in the modern era."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"Of course, it’s still close to twice the white unemployment—it is twice the unemployment rate, or it was back in the—back then."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s certainly much higher now.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,What we’ve targeted is broader financial conditions.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, the—the best thing we can do with our monetary policy tools is to—is to look at, you know, the evidence of what we saw—that we saw with our own eyes so recently, which is that the economy can have very low unemployment—very low unemployment."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"It could be lower than 3½ percent without seeing financial imbalances, without seeing inflation going—getting out of control."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"We, frankly, didn’t even get inflation back up to target—without seeing wages getting out of touch with—with where they should be, so that’s the—that’s the biggest thing we can do."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, in—in—inequality is something that’s been with us increasingly for more than four decades, and it’s—it’s not really related to monetary policy."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s, or—or it’s more related to—there are a lot of theories on—on what causes it, but it’s been something that’s more or less been going up consistently for more than four decades."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"And there are a lot of different theories, one of which is—just is that it—globalization—globalization and technology call for rising levels of skills and aptitudes and education, and that U.S. educational attainment kind of flattened out, certainly relative to our peers—flattened out over that period."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"And so a lot—so that means if you’re—if you’re on the right side of those trends, then those things are good for you."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,It could’ve been lower than we were.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"Chair Powell, I’m wondering—I want to go back to the issue of inequality, and I’m wondering, what more could the Fed do to reduce economic inequality in this country?"
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"If you go back to the end of February and early March, you had—basically, the world markets realized at just about the same time—I remember that Monday—that there was going to be a global pandemic, and that this possibility that it would be contained in one province in China, for all practical purposes, was not going to happen."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"From that point forward, investors everywhere in the world, for a period of weeks, wanted to sell everything that wasn’t cash or a—a short-term Treasury instrument."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you very much.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, we hope that continues."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s just we want markets to be working, and I think, partly as a result of what we’ve done, they—they are working."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"And— and, again, not—we’re not—we’re not focused on moving asset prices in a particular direction at all."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I would say that, you know, we’re tightly focused on our real economy goals."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,They’ve been a source of strength in this situation.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,They’ve been taking in deposits.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,And they’ve been lending.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,You have all of those things.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’re also pursuing financial stability, but there you have a banking system that is so much better capitalized, so much stronger, better aware of its risks, better at managing its risks, more highly liquid."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’re supposed to be pursuing maximum employment and stable prices, and that’s what we’re pursuing."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, what would happen to the people that we’re actually legally supposed to be serving?"
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I would say, you know, we—if we were to hold back because—we would never do this, but—the idea that, just the concept that we would hold back because we think asset prices are too high—others may not think so, but we just decided that that’s the case—what would happen to those people?"
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s—that’s been our major focus.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, really, it’s about getting the labor market back and getting it in shape."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"Now, inflation, of course, is—is low, and we think it’s very likely to remain low for some time, below our target."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think our—our principal focus, though, is on—on the state of the economy and on the labor market and on inflation."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,They didn’t want it to have any risk at all.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"And so what happened is, markets stopped working."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"They stopped working, and companies couldn’t—couldn’t borrow."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,They couldn’t roll over their debt.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,People couldn’t borrow.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,So that’s—that’s the kind of situation that can be very—financial turbulence and malfunction—a financial system that’s not working can greatly amplify the negative effects of what was clearly going to be a major economic shock.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"It all—it was—you know, it was Iran, Italy, Korea, and then it became clear in markets."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,So what our tools were—were put to work to do was to restore the markets to function.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,There were some piecemeal forbearance measures put into place in various jurisdictions and also to a slice of the mortgage market to prevent banks from foreclosing on such debts amid the widespread financial hardships caused by the pandemic.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,What we want is investors to be pricing in risk like markets are supposed to do.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,Borrowers are borrowing.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,Lenders are lending.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,We want the markets to be working.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, again, we’re not looking to—to a particular level."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I think, you know, some of that has really happened, as I—as I mentioned in my opening remarks, and that’s a good thing."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,We’ll—we’ll know more as we go forward.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"Nancy Marshall-Genzer, Marketplace."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,Nancy Marshall-Genzer.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I think the—the forecast would not have included substantial additional—you know, big additional fiscal support for the economy."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"In terms of the way—the way we do forecasts is, we—we don’t— the—we don’t tend to incorporate things we’re highly uncertain about."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,Is it just making sure that borrowers that want to borrow through the program are—are—are able to do that?
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"So my question is, what’s the threshold for those types of changes?"
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"You’ve mentioned multiple times that, you know, the Fed and Treasury are willing to expand the program further."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,And then my other question is on—on Main Street.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"First of all, on fiscal policy, you all obviously put out your Summary of Economic Projections today, and I’m curious to what extent future fiscal policy is factored in or not factored in to those projections, and—and how, more or less, fiscal policy might affect those projections."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,I just wanted to follow up on a couple of things that are—have already been asked.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, I’m Victoria Guida with Politico."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,VICTORIA GUIDA.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,Victoria from Politico.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,And so we would really like to get back to that— get back to that place.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"What—what we are—we are cognizant of the fact, though, that late in the last cycle, late in the last expansion, the benefits really do go more to people at the lower end of the wage spectrum for—for the first time in many years when labor markets are tight, when unemployment is low."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, we don’t target different groups."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"We can—we can use them until we do fully recover, and that—that’s what we’re planning to do."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"And so a lot of the lost jobs were from people who work in the service economy, dealing with the public, for example, and relatively—compared to other jobs, relatively low wages."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, and if—if you just look at what that is, unemployment has gone up more for Hispanics, more for African Americans."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,And women have borne—borne an extraordinary—a notable share of the burden beyond their percentage in the workforce.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"So that’s really—really, really unfortunate, because if you just go back two months, where we were was, we had, effectively, the first tight labor market in a quarter-century."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"And for the last couple of years before the pandemic hit, you were seeing wages go up the most for people at the lower end of the wage spectrum, and that was great."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, we were meeting with people from low- and—low- and moderate-income communities all over the country and hearing, “Don’t change this."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"Maybe—maybe a modest amount, something that looks like a—a low-end guess on what might come out of the current negotiations."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,Do whatever you—do whatever you can.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"This is the best labor market we’ve seen.” And we had every expect—every expectation, every reason to expect that this would continue, and then this comes."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"So it’s—it’s heartbreaking, and, you know, we want to get it back, so—we really want to get it back."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,And so I think we learned a number of things over the course of the last few years.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"One of them is that, you know, I—you—you can have 3, 3½ percent unemployment for a couple of years, and, really, you see modest moves in wages and relatively almost invisible moves in inflation."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"So that was not anybody’s understanding of the structure of the economy, I think, or most peoples’, anyway."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,So we can use our tools to—to support the labor market and support the economy.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,Keep this going.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s basically what would be in the baseline.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, we’re—we’re spending a lot, and that’s really what they get to decide."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"We all know people who—to whom that happened in the Global Financial Crisis, and, hence, our desire to—to do what we can to support this and—and—and support this recovery with—with the tools that we have."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"And—and, you know, it’s very tough on their lives."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"If you have to go to a different industry and start over again, it’s much harder, and that’s where you start to lose people’s—who are—just fall out of the labor force."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s usually the fastest.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mean, when—when people lose a job, if they can find a job in their own industry, that’s usually the fastest way, is—is they know other people in that industry, different kinds of jobs."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"There will eventually be, but it could be some years before we get back to those people finding jobs."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, in fact, there isn’t a—there may not be a job in that industry for them for some time."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"I—I don’t want to give you a number, because it’s going to be a guess, but well, well into the millions of people who—who don’t get to go back to their old job."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"I—I, but I—my—my assumption is that there will be a significant chunk—chunk well into the millions."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"I—you know, it’s just going to be very hard to say."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"People are—for example, people are going back and looking at other significant changes in the economy, and they’ve seen how many people go back when, for example, there’s a technological change, and things like that—you may have seen some of this research—and you come up with an estimate."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s—it’s so uncertain, but it—it could be a good number of millions of people, I think, in many—in many estimates, but these—I’d say you’re so early in the process."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"But—and I—I would say, many will go back, but what’s—what’s going to be the remainder when—you know, when we reach sort of what is the new normal?"
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"Clearly, not everyone will go back."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,I don’t have a reliable estimate of that.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"In terms of Main Street and our willingness to expand it further, I think we’re—one thing we’re looking at—very strongly looking at is—is nonprofits, and is there a way to—to incorporate them into—into that facility or a similar facility."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,So that’s another dimension.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"I— you know, if we had a great idea for changing Main Street, we would’ve done it."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,And we—and we have done some things that I think are really very positive lately here.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"But if we—as we learn more, it could be—it could be in terms of size, it could be in terms of lots of different things."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"But I—I think we have a good product to go to market with now, and I think it’ll get— it’ll get out there soon."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, of course, if there were more fiscal support, you’d see—you’d see better results sooner, but that’s a question for Congress."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, we’ll see, and—and we’ll be willing to continue to adapt."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.

2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"Chair Powell, as you know, the vast majority of people who have been laid off are expecting to be recalled by their employers."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"At this point, what is your expectation of how much of these job losses will be permanent?"
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,I wanted to ask you about regulatory forbearance.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I will just say this: It’s possible that we will need to do more, and it’s possible that Congress will need to do more."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hello, Chair Powell."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"So the first thing is, monetary policy is in a good place, and it’s—that’s well understood in the markets."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"And if you look at surveys of more forecasters and market participants, financial market prices, et cetera, those also appropriately reflect a long spell with rates at the effective lower bound."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"You can see that in—in the dot plot, as I think you pointed out, that overwhelmingly, FOMC participants expect, as their baseline expectation, no rate increase at least through 2022."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,And we’ve said that we’ll keep it there until the economy has weathered the effects of the virus and is on track to achieve our goals.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"As you know, we—we lowered our policy rate very quickly, [more] quickly than others, to the effective lower bound."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"If we didn’t think that, of course, we would change our policy now."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, first, I would say that we think that monetary policy today is currently well positioned to support the economy in this challenging time."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, third, how close is the Committee to reaching a decision on a—a more concrete forward guidance and whether yield caps might reinforce that guidance?"
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"Second, how might that change your response?"
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"And so my questions are, first, what are you hoping to learn by waiting?"
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,And yet the Committee did not take any steps to date to—to reinforce your forward guidance.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"I want to ask about the economic projections, and I realize these are more of an educated guess at this point, but they suggest the Committee sees quite a large output gap over the next two years."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,Nick Timiraos at the Wall Street Journal.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thanks, Chair Powell."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"Yes, hi."

2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"Finally, I want to acknowledge the tragic events that have again put a spotlight on the pain of racial injustice in this country."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,The Federal Reserve serves the entire nation.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"We operate in, and are part of, many of the communities across the country where Americans are grappling with and expressing themselves on issues of racial equality."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,I speak for my colleagues throughout the Federal Reserve System when I say that there is no place at the Federal Reserve for racism and there should be no place for it in our society.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,Everyone deserves the opportunity to participate fully in our society and in our economy.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"These principles guide us in all we do, from monetary policy to our focus on diversity and inclusion in our workplace and to our work to ensure fair access to credit across the country."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"Secondly, we’ve also taken strong measures to support the flow of credit in the economy, as I mentioned."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,We will take this opportunity to renew our steadfast commitment to these principles.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,Everything we do is in service to our public mission.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,We are committed to using our full range of tools to support the economy and to help assure that the recovery from this difficult period will be as robust as possible.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,I look forward to our questions.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"For the first question, Nick Timiraos."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"We understand that the work of the Fed touches communities, families, and businesses across the country."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,The risk-management approach—this risk-management approach is the best way we can promote our maximum-employment and price-stability goals in these unusually uncertain circumstances.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, third, we’re continuing asset prices in coming months at—at a— at a relatively high level.1 So for all those reasons, we feel like policy is now in a good place."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, at this meeting, what we did was, as I mentioned, we—we looked in some depth at forward guidance and asset purchases and looked carefully at those."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,We hope we get many more like it.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I’ll—I’ll just say again that we are—the—the May employment report, of course, was a—was a welcome surprise, very pleased."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"We— we are looking carefully at what the—as we learn more and—and better understand the—the path of the economy, we will be assessing, what’s the best way to deploy all of our tools to achieve our goals in the best possible way?"
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,So I do—I think we’re in the right place now.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,So I think we have to be humble about our ability to move inflation up and particularly when unemployment is—is going to be above most estimates of the natural rate for—certainly above the median in our—in our—in our SEP well through the end of—past the end of 2022.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"We got close for the last couple of years, but we never did quite get there."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"In terms of inflation, you’ll know that we—we had a 128-month expansion, and we never did quite get inflation back to 2 percent on a symmetric, sustained basis."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,So that’s really what we’re—what we’re looking for.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,We’re going to learn a whole lot about the—the path of the economy in the next—in coming months.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,The economy is reopening.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s a pretty good illustration of just how uncertain these times are.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"I—I think, actually, if you look at the May employment report, it’s a pretty good—probably the biggest data surprise that anybody can remember."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,And so what we’re—what we’re waiting for is to—is to learn more.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,So we have all of our tools in—in use in a strong way.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"We have asset purchases, and we’ve now said that we won’t go any lower than this, and—but—but that we’re prepared to adjust as appropriate, and rates are at the effective lower bound."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"And remember, we’re using—we’re using our—our emergency 13(3) lending tools to an unprecedented extent."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,Our current policy stance is appropriate.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,We also received a briefing on the historical experience with yield curve control.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,And we’ll continue those discussions in upcoming meetings and evaluate our stance and communications as more and portion—more— more information about the trajectory of the economy becomes available.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"I—I would just say, in terms of—of what we’re looking for, we—we expect to get a better understanding of the economy’s trajectory and, particularly, how we should best deploy those tools to achieve those goals."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"So that’s really what we’re looking to achieve, and, as you can see, we’re—we’re actively at work on that."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,1 Chair Powell intended to say “asset purchases” rather than “asset prices.” MICHELLE SMITH.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,Okay.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"So as we look ahead, we see that the path for the—ahead for the economy is highly uncertain and continues to depend to a really significant degree on the path of the pandemic."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"Next, Jeanna."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Chair Powell."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you so much for taking our questions.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"I’m—I’m curious about your inflation forecasts, which are—are pretty low across the forecast horizon."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"I guess just given how low you see inflation being over the coming years, why is policy appropriate now, and why not just kind of throw everything you can—you know, everything and the kitchen sink at it currently?"
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,And I guess if you could just talk a little bit about what urgency you see in—in returning it back to that 2 percent target.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,JEANNA SMIALEK.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"Of course, my colleagues and I will continue to base our policy decisions on the full range of plausible outcomes and not on a particular forecast."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"What the June SEP shows is a general expectation of an economic recovery beginning in the second half of this year and lasting over the next couple of years, supported by interest rates that remain at their current level, near zero."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"Nonetheless, we believe that regular publication of the SEP provides a useful perspective on the way FOMC participants are assessing the path ahead."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,We are committed to using our full range of tools to support the economy in this challenging time.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"The Fed’s response is guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people, along with our responsibilities to promote the stability of the financial system."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,The severity of the downturn will also depend on the policy actions taken at all levels of government to provide relief and to support the recovery when the public health crisis passes.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"We all want to get back to normal, but a full recovery is unlikely to occur until people are confident that it is safe to reengage in a broad range of activities."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,The extent of the downturn and the pace of recovery remain extraordinarily uncertain and will depend in large part on our success in containing the virus.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,Indicators of longer-term inflation expectations have been fairly steady.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"As a result, inflation has fallen well below our symmetric 2 percent objective."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"Weak demand, especially in sectors most affected by the pandemic, is holding down consumer prices."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"Moreover, despite the improvements seen in the May jobs report, unemployment remains historically high."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"Activity in many parts of the economy has yet to pick up, however, and overall output is far below earlier levels."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"At the same time, many households have been receiving stimulus payments and unemployment benefits, which are supporting incomes and spending."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"With the easing of social- distancing restrictions across the country, people are increasingly moving about, and many businesses are resuming operations to varying degrees."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"Employment rose in many sectors of the economy in May, and the unemployment [rate] edged down as some workers returned to their jobs from temporary layoffs."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"In recent weeks, some indicators suggest a stabilization or even a modest rebound in some segments of the economy, such as retail merchandise and motor vehicle sales."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"In particular, the rise in joblessness has been especially severe for lower-wage workers, for women, and for African Americans and Hispanics."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"The downturn has not fallen equally on all Americans, and those least able to shoulder the burden have been the most affected."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"As was highlighted by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, this figure likely understates the extent of unemployment; accounting for the unusually large number of workers who reported themselves as employed but absent from their jobs would raise the unemployment rate by about 3 percentage points."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,This is Matthew Boesler with Bloomberg News.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"Transcript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference June 10, 2020 CHAIR POWELL."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"Our country continues to face a difficult and challenging time, as the pandemic is causing tremendous hardship here in the United States and around the world."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,People have lost loved ones.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,Many millions have lost their jobs.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"In March, we quickly lowered our policy interest rate to near zero, where we expect to keep it until we are confident that the economy has weathered recent events and is on track to achieve our maximum-employment and price-stability goals."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,There is great uncertainty about the future.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,The most important response to this crisis has come from our health-care workers.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"And on behalf of the Federal Reserve, let me express our sincere gratitude to those dedicated individuals who put themselves at risk, day after day, in service to others and to our nation."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,Let me also thank the many other essential workers across the country who have helped meet our basic needs for goods and services in these difficult times.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,The virus and the forceful measures taken to control its spread have induced a sharp decline in economic activity and a surge in job losses.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"Indicators of spending and production plummeted in April, and the decline in real GDP in the current quarter is likely to be the most severe on record."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"Even after the unexpectedly positive May employment report, nearly 20 million jobs have been lost on net since February, and the unemployment rate has risen about 10 percentage points, to 13.3 percent."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"At the Federal Reserve, we are strongly committed to using our tools to do whatever we can—and for as long as it takes—to provide some relief and stability, to ensure that the recovery will be as strong as possible, and to limit lasting damage to the economy."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,We have also been taking broad and forceful actions to support the flow of credit in the economy.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"Without access to credit, families could be forced to cut back on necessities or even lose their homes."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"Businesses could be forced to downsize or close, resulting in further losses of jobs and incomes and worsening the downturn."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"In these cases, direct fiscal support may be needed."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"Elected officials have the power to tax and spend and to make decisions about where we, as a society, should direct our collective resources."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,The CARES Act and other legislation provide direct help to people and businesses and communities.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"This direct support can make a critical difference not just in helping families and businesses in a time of need, but also in limiting long-lasting damage to our economy."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"At this meeting, my colleagues and I continued our discussion of approaches for conducting monetary policy when the federal funds rate is at its lower bound."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,The measures we discussed included explicit forms of forward guidance and asset purchases.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"But for many others, getting a loan that may be difficult to repay may not be the answer."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"We used these tools in the aftermath of the Global Financial Crisis, and they have become a standard part of our toolkit."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,We will continue our discussions in upcoming meetings and will evaluate our monetary policy stance and communications as more information about the trajectory of the economy becomes available.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"We also resumed our regular quarterly Summary of Economic Projections, or the SEP."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"The SEP is an input into our deliberations, not an outcome, and it does not represent a Committee view."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"Rather, FOMC participants write down their individual views of the most likely path for the economy, conditioned on each participant’s view of appropriate monetary policy."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"We tabulate those submissions, and we publish them as the SEP."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"Given the unusually high level of uncertainty about the outlook, many participants noted that they see a number of reasonably likely paths for the economy, and that it’s not possible to identify with confidence a single path as the “most likely” one."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,We also reviewed the historical and foreign experience with targeting interest rates along the yield curve.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,But I think we have to be honest.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"Many borrowers will benefit from these programs, as will the overall economy."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,The Fed cannot grant money to particular beneficiaries.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,Preserving the flow of credit is thus essential for mitigating the damage to the economy and setting the stage for the recovery.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"Since March, we have been purchasing sizable quantities of Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities in order to support the smooth functioning of these markets, which are vital to the flow of credit in the economy."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,Our ongoing purchases have helped to restore orderly market conditions and have fostered more accommodative financial conditions.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"As market functioning has improved since the strains experienced in March, we have gradually reduced the pace of these purchases."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"To sustain smooth market functioning and thereby foster the effective transmission of monetary policy to broader financial conditions, we will increase our holdings of Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities over coming months at least at the current pace."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,We will closely monitor developments and are prepared to adjust our plans as appropriate to support our goals.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,We can only create programs or facilities with broad-based eligibility to make loans to solvent entity—entities with the expectation that the loans will be repaid.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"The Federal Reserve is also undertaking programs to provide stability to the financial system and to more directly support the flow of credit in the economy—for households, for businesses of all sizes, and for state and local governments."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"In addition, by serving as a backstop to key credit markets, the programs can increase the willingness of private lenders to extend credit."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"Many of these programs rely on emergency lending powers that are available only in very unusual circumstances, such as these—those we find ourselves in today."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"We are deploying these lending powers to an unprecedented extent, enabled in large part by financial backing and support from Congress and from the Treasury."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"We will continue to use these powers forcefully, proactively, and aggressively until we’re confident that we are solidly on the road to recovery."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"When the time comes, after the crisis has passed, we will put these emergency tools back in the toolbox."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"I would stress that these are lending powers, not spending powers."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,These programs benefit the economy by providing financing where it is not otherwise available.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s a—it’s a long road.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,Whether such an approach would usefully complement our main tools remains an open question.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s going to take some time.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,So if you could kind of give us some clarity of what you’re seeing that needs to continue to be smooth at that level and that pace.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"You say that it’s needed to continue the smooth functioning of markets, but I guess most of us aren’t really seeing a lot of instability in markets right now."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,The first is the ongoing bond buying program.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,I’m struggling with two things that I hope you can provide some clarity on.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"Good afternoon, Chair Powell."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,Hi.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,HEATHER LONG.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,Heather Long.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"They’re called—they’re longer-run assessments, so I—I would—I have not changed mine, and I’m hopeful that—that I won’t have to change it."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"So—but I think it’s way too early to be—to be changing the longer run—see, these are—these are not meant to be short- run numbers."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"And maybe these—it’s probably hopeful at this point to say that—that we won’t have longer-run damage to the economy, and these numbers won’t change."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s—that’s kind of the most important part of this exercise.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,What we’re trying to do is create an environment in which they have the best chance either to go back to their old job or to get a new job.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"Basically, if you look at what’s happened, as I mentioned, there’s something—somewhere short of 25 million people have been displaced, even after the good May employment report."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,And that’s all the things that we’re trying to do.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"And—and we do that with measures that—that, you know, keep people in their homes; that—that support hiring; that support growth; that avoid unnecessary, avoidable business insolvencies."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"They get out of touch with the skills and—that they need, and—and they have a hard time getting back in, and that drives that—that, you know, it’s very damaging to people’s lives and their working lives."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"And it also just lowers, in a way—it can—it can increase the—you know, the unemployment rate, but it can also lower the labor force participation rate, which is almost worse, in a way, to have people dropping out of the labor force where we need them in the—in the labor force working."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,The other piece of it is just businesses.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, a shock like this that just comes in, it’s like a natural disaster."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"You wouldn’t want a lot of perfectly good businesses, particularly the smaller and medium-sized businesses that may not have a lot of resources to sustain them to— you know, to go out of business permanently in a situation like that—like this where, really, there was no reason for it."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"Of course, you know, businesses are going to go in and out."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"Second is, you know, you were just talking about Fed concerns about small and medium-sized companies going out of business during this."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"They’re going to fail all the time, and that’s a healthy thing in capitalism."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,But this is different.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,This is a way—potentially—so those are the things we’ve been worried about.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,We didn’t change.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"You—you’re right, though."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,We didn’t change our longer-run estimate of—of potential growth or of the unemployment rate.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"And that’s—I would say, in my thinking, the reason I didn’t change mine is that I still—I—I think we can avoid that or avoid much of that, most of that even."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s something that has to happen.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"One, through extended periods of unemployment, people lose contact with the labor force."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, I guess, you know, the Main Street Lending Program still isn’t running yet."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,MATTHEW BOESLER.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s—it’s, depending on how you count it, well more than 20 million people displaced in the labor market."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"Okay, Matt from Bloomberg."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we’ve—we’ve been, you know, very willing to adapt and will continue to be."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,You—you have to draw this up and then try it out.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,There’s no—there’s no playbook here.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,These are unique.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,And—and that’s true of all of our facilities.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, by the way, we’re—we’re going to be prepared to adapt further, if we need to."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I do think this has—this has been a challenging project, but I think we’ve come to a—to a better place."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,So all of that should happen quickly now.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,And it’s 95 percent across the board now in the Main Street facility can be sold.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"Shortly after that, the facility itself will be up, and those facilities can be—those loans can be sold—95 percent of the loans."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"At that time, loans can begin to be made."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,The next step will be to register lenders.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,We’re putting them through the facility.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"There have been gains in market function, although not fully back to where you would say they were, for example, in—in February, before the pandemic arrived."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"We don’t take those gains for granted, though."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"This is a—this is a highly fluid situation, and we’re— we’re not taking those for granted."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, in addition, as I pointed out in my—in my statement, those purchases are clearly also supporting highly accommodative—or accommodative financial conditions, and that’s—that’s a good thing, so that’s why we’re doing that."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"Turning quickly to Main Street, so I would say that the thing—what we’ve done on Main Street, I think to a greater degree, is, we’ve listened to feedback."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we’ve been out repeatedly for feedback in trying to create a—a much more difficult product than, really, the other facilities."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,When do you expect loans to start happening?
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,And I think this—this last set of changes we made have actually been very positive for the facility.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,And that—we are now in the—in the—in the final run-up to starting the facility.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"What we did, as you saw earlier—I guess it’s early this week or late, whenever we did it in the last few days—was we lowered the minimum loan size and we increased the maximum loan size."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, I think, even more importantly, we lengthened the maturity and we stretched out the repayment schedule significantly."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,So borrowers will get a—a two-year delay until they have to make any principal payments—repayments and a one-year delay on interest.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,So we had been hearing from both borrowers and lenders that these would be very helpful.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,We made the changes.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think it’s going to be better able to achieve its goals, and, you know, so we’ve used the time well, I think."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I think it’s—it’s not the risk for the next few months, but it’s the risk over time of—of lasting damage to the—to these— you know, to the productive capacity of the United States, typically in two forms."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,And do you think the two-month delay has—has hurt the chances of some companies surviving?
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, I would say, you know, we’d be looking to get inflation back up, and we—we’d be prepared to tolerate pretty low—welcome, in fact, not tolerate but welcome very low readings on—on unemployment just based on what we—what we saw in the last—in the last expansion."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, you know, we’re—we’re not thinking about raising rates."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,We’re not even thinking about thinking about raising rates.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,So what we’re thinking about is—is providing support for this economy.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,We do think this is going to take some time.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,I think most forecasters believe that.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,We didn’t see any problems with price inflation.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,It would be great if—if we got a whole bunch more months of job creation like that.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"And it seems quite likely that there will be a significant group at the end of— even—even after a lot of strong job growth, that’ll still be struggling to find jobs, and we’ll still be providing strong accommodation for that."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"Okay, thank you."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,James.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,JAMES POLITI.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thanks very much, Chair Powell."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"Not— notwithstanding that, as I mentioned, there are—there are just a lot of people that are unemployed."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,There have been plenty of comparisons with the Great Depression of the 1930s since the crisis began.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"And during that period of time, we saw a lot of great things happening in the labor market, things that we’d love to get back to."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,I would start with—that’s where I would start.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we are going to be deploying our tools—all of our tools, to their full extent, in pursuit of that—of those goals, however long it takes."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"Chris, this is a really important risk."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,Okay.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,Steve Liesman.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,STEVE LIESMAN.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"I would say, you know, we were—we just had a period of unemployment, as you know, that was in the—well below 4 percent, hanging around 3½ percent, that lasted two years."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,I think I don’t understand how you might react if things come out better than expected—kind of a variant on these other questions.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,How firm is the commitment to lower interest rates?
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"And if things end up better, do you stick with these low interest rates, as you—as you projected them?"
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"And—or is it specific points that you have in mind—for example, unemployment or inflation—that is animating where you might go?"
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,And what are those numbers that you’re looking for that might cause you to change about the policy as it now is projected?
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,I think I understand how the Fed might react in the event things come out worse than expected.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mean, is that scenario sort of got[ten] more dire as data comes out and we’re looking at a more traditional and sudden recession?"
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,Price inflation didn’t really react much.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, ultimately, we do see a full recovery over time."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"And that’s really what, you know, what I think I’m—I’m personally seeing."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"And you could see significant job growth in—in coming months as people return to their jobs, but you’re still going to face probably an extended period where it will be difficult for many people to find work."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"And for—and that’s what you see in—in—in, really, many, many forecasts at this point."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"So what kind of data are you looking at to gauge that potential impact, and what is—what is it telling us so far?"
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,Those will be the harder parts of the economy to recover.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,CHRISTOPHER RUGABER.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,Hi.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you for taking our questions.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,And are you at all concerned that the performance—the strong performance in the stock market in the last few weeks is disconnected from economic reality?
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"Well, in the projections you have—you didn’t change the—the Fed policymakers didn’t change their—the forecast for long-run unemployment, so that suggests that you—you know, the—that all of you so far don’t see necessarily prospects for long-term damage."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"But still, what kind of data are you looking at here to gauge, you know, the potential for longer-term hits to the economy even as we have some of these—even as we have something like the May jobs report, you could still have, at the same time, people return from temporary layoffs, there could still be permanent job losses?"
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,Chris from the Associated Press.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"People will adjust, probably a little bit gradually, to some of the activities that would— that involve getting together in small—in large groups in close quarters."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"That doesn’t mean it’s right, but that’s sort of a—a broad expectation, certainly not the Depression forecast."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,This was a very—an economy that was in a healthy place.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,And there—there are just so many fundamental differences.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"First, the government response has been so fast and so forceful."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,The origin was quite different.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,I don’t think that the—that the Great Depression is a good example or a likely outcome or a model for what’s happening here at all.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know—and I would say, assuming that the—that the—that the disease remains or becomes pretty much under control, I think that what you see is a—is a very weak second quarter, historically weak, and then an—an expansion that builds momentum over time."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"Of course, every economy has longer-run challenges, not—and that—that includes our economy, notwithstanding that 50-year low in unemployment and the longest expansion in our history and every reason to think it could continue."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,I really don’t.
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"The financial system this time was in— was in—was in very good shape, much better capitalized."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, you know, it’s just not the right model."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"I would say, we’re learning."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, every month that passes, we’re seeing more, we’re learning more."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I think particularly the next few months will be very important in learning what the—what the real story will be, because we’ll see the—the significant incoming data about the opening of the economy—the reopening of the economy."
2020-06-10,Press Conf - Full Text,So that’s different from what was happening around the time of the Great—the Depression started.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,And we always point this out in our—in our remarks.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, first, on the unemployment, you’re right."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"You’ll see it everywhere, in all the things that we do."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think—you know, I think what we learned is that a tight labor market really does a lot of good things for minorities and people at the lower end of the income spectrum generally."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Is this your Federal Reserve?
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Okay.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"While the aggregate unemployment rate was 3½ percent, every—every economy—every market in every economy has longer-run issues."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we have started, though, in recent years to focus considerable time and attention on disparate levels of unemployment—for example, among—among different racial groups and demographic groups."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,And it’s generally sort of twice as much—twice as high for Blacks.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"So even—but this was the lowest, you know, Black unemployment rate in 50 years—or, actually, since we started keeping records, which was less than 50 years ago."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"So that’s just a fact, and it’s—it’s not a good fact, you know."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,We regularly discuss those differences in our FOMC discussions.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,We call them out in testimony and in speeches and in our Monetary Policy Report to Congress.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,So what does that mean?
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,And one of ours is just the disparate level of unemployment between—between Blacks and whites.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,She gave a pretty harrowing account of her time at the Fed—described harassment and professional gaslighting that others have also spoken to.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think 14 million people are now out of work who were working in February, something like that."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,And how would you do that?
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,We’re—we’re in this until—until we’re well through it.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,So I wouldn’t look for us to be sending signals about cutting back on facilities or anything like that for a very long time.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"But it—you know, tight labor markets, it took 8 years—it took sort of the 8th and 9th and 10th years of that expansion to get to those benefits."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,And we’re absolutely committed to staying in this until—until we’re very confident that that is no longer needed.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I think this—you know, I think the picture is, you have the—you have the lockdown, then you have the reopening."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"But there’s probably going to be a long tail where a large number of people are struggling to get back to work because those—those heavily affected areas of the economy are going to be challenged, really, to employ the millions of people who are now out of work."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"So that’s going to take a while, I think, in everyone’s reckoning."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,And I just—everyone should know that we’re going to be there for all of that.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Catarina with Bloomberg.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,CATARINA SARAIVA.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Chair."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks for taking our questions.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"You mentioned earlier that the labor market we had in February was the best we’ve had in 50 years, yet at that point the Black unemployment rate was still double that of whites."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I wanted to ask you, you know, we’ve seen some economists and even the Biden campaign call for the Fed to more specifically target the gap between minority unemployment rates."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Even if you don’t get a mandate on this from Congress, is it something you would consider more explicitly going forward?"
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,And then I also wanted to ask you about former economist Claudia Sahm’s writings from last night.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,So we need more than that.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"I will look into—into that and—when I—you know, when this is over."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we’re—we’re going to get back there as fast as we can, because that’s what we can do, but society more broadly can affect these things."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,They do.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"They—mostly, they get it that if you want to attract the best people, this is what you—you’re going to attract the best people by having a diverse and inclusive workforce, so—and workplace."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,So we’ve made diversity a priority.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"We actually—you know, this has been a big issue for the economics profession."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"We had the—the two heads of the AEA task force on this—who happen to be named Ben Bernanke and Janet Yellen—come here, and I cohosted a—an event with them, I guess, last year or the year before, which had several hundred—500 people or something like that listening in about—about these issues."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,So we’re doing a lot.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,I’m sure we can do more.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I—my experience has been, you know, from my career in business too, is that organizations—the really successful organizations in our society get this."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’re doing a lot to—you know, to foster a respectful climate—particularly for women, but for—for all people."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Okay, thank you."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Don Lee.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,DON LEE.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,We think that the economy will need highly accommodative monetary policy and the use of our tools for an extended period.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Chair Powell, on the labor market, jobless claims rose again recently, and new hiring activity has weakened."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"I wonder, how big are the risks of the unemployment rate rising and job growth turning negative this summer?"
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,So it’s—it’s a very high priority for us as an organization.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"That’s not a good strategy, waiting 8, 9, 10 years to get there."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,I think a lot of organizations are coming around to understanding the importance of that.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,And I think we’ve made a lot of progress on that.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, we don’t really have tools that can address distributional, disparate outcomes as well as fiscal policy."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"And just policy generally—education, health care, all those things are much better at doing that."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,In terms of—so we do—you will see that—you will see that discussed—the Black unemployment rate discussed all the time in what we do.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,And I think we clearly understand now that it’s something to weigh when you get a tight labor market.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s something that you want to be focused on and weigh.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"So it is very much in our thinking—again, in a world where we don’t really have the best tools to address that."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, something that we’re doing."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think we want a place where it’s free to speak, where views are welcome, where people can disagree but must do so respectfully."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I have not seen that—I did not see that blog post yet, although someone did mention it to me."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, but—and I will take a look at it."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,I will do that.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, I—without having had a chance to think about it, read it, understand it, I’ll just say a couple things."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"First, I think it’s fair to acknowledge that there’s been a lot of pain and injustice and unfair treatment that women have experienced in the workplace—not just among economists, but among economists and at the Fed."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s been going on for far too long.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, like every other organization, the Fed could have done more and—and should have done more."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"I would say, though, that we—you know, we have made it a very high priority to have as diverse and inclusive an organization as we can."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"We, of course, have been in meetings until just before this."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,We’re—we’re totally focused on providing the economy the support that it will need.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"We are committed to using our full range of tools to support the U.S. economy at this difficult time, and we will always remain committed in that sense."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,The company might not want to take a loan out in order to pay workers who can’t work because there’s no business.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"So lending is a particular tool, and we’re using it very aggressively."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"But fiscal policy is essential here, and I would say, again, Congress’s action early in the pandemic—historically large by any standard around the world, and certainly by U.S. standards—it’s really helping now."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s really helping.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s going to stand up very well to—to scrutiny down the years.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"This Congress’s very fast and very open-handed response, I think, has really helped."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I think—I know that, as I’ve said, very likely more will be needed from— from all of us, and I see Congress negotiating now over—over a new package, and I think that’s a good thing."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"If there are particular groups that need help, that need direct monetary help— not a loan, but an actual grant as the PPP program showed—you can save a lot of businesses and a lot of jobs with those in a case where lending a company money might not be the right answer."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Edward Lawrence.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,EDWARD LAWRENCE.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for taking the question."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,So you talked about it several times today: The FOMC statement directly says the path of the economy is linked to the path of the virus.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"It looks like a vaccine might come this year, either in October or towards the end of the year."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Has the Committee talked about how that might change Fed policies?
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, as a follow, do you see a vaccine helping inflation get back to where you want it to be?"
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Okay.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Fiscal policy can do—can address things that we can’t address.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,We—we feel like we have the ability to do more.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Mr. Chairman, I’m wondering what it is—you’ve talked a lot about using all of your tools, and Governor Brainard talked about moving from support to accommodation—what it is you can actually do."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,You’ve lowered rates to zero.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,You’ve set up the lending programs.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,There hasn’t been much take-up.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"And the tools you talk about are generally in service of keeping interest rates low, where they already are."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"So unless you were to go to negative interest rates, I’m wondering what additional accommodation the Fed can bring."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,But I would not disagree with the—with the importance of fiscal policy—with your statement about the importance of fiscal policy.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Or is it really up to the fiscal authorities at this point to rescue the economy, to—to add additional help for it?"
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Right.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,So you’re right.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"We feel like we have ways to further support the economy certainly through our credit and liquidity facilities, which are effectively unlimited."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,We can adjust those programs.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,We also can adjust our forward guidance.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,We can adjust our asset purchases.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,So there are things that we can do.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"So as I—as I said earlier, or a while back, we’re not even thinking about—thinking about raising rates."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Of course it does.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, you know, as we’ve said, we’re carefully monitoring the situation."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"We moved very quickly and very aggressively early, and we’ve been monitoring the situation."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I think the markets and—and the economy—you know, I think our policy is in a good place."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"But we’ve looked at—at ways of adapting our policy as time goes by, and we’re ready to do that when we think it’s appropriate."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,I can’t give you a specific trigger.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"And on the flip side of that, when would it be reasonable to expect the Fed to consider raising rates again?"
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,It really just is when we think it would help: Would it help more than what we’re doing now to foster maximum employment and stable prices?
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,[Inaudible] I can’t hear you.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Say it again?
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,ANN SAPHIR.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Sorry—for when it would be reasonable for the Fed to consider raising— CHAIR POWELL.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Oh.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,ANN SAPHIR.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,—rates again.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Sorry, your second question was?"
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we—of course, the concept of vaccines comes up in our discussions."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, I mean, as you monitor the rising infections and the slowing pace of the recovery, could you speak to, what would the trigger be for doing further easing?"
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Hi.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"But I have to say, you know, we’re—our job is not to plan for the upside case, right?"
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,The upside case—we’ve got that covered.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Our job is to plan for all—the full range of things that could happen.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"And so we’re assuming—we’re going to continue to assume that our facilities are needed, that our policies are needed, and that the public needs—you know, needs the support that we’re giving the public until—until shown otherwise."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,There’s great uncertainty around the development of therapeutics and vaccines.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"All of us want them to happen as soon as possible, but we can’t plan on that."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’ve got to hope for the worst—hope for the [laughs]—hope for the best and plan for the worst, I guess it goes."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Yes, thanks for taking my question."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"In terms of inflation, I don’t know."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"I know there—there is a lot of discussion about how this might lead to inflation over time, but, you know, we’re—we’re seeing disinflationary pressures around the world going into this."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Now we see a big shock to demand, and we see core inflation dropping to 1 percent."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,And I do think for quite some time we’re going to be struggling against disinflationary pressures rather than against inflationary pressures.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Ann Saphir.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,ANN SAPHIR.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mean, I—you know, I think, fundamentally, this is a disinflationary shock."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"So as I mentioned earlier, you know, we’re watching this high- frequency data."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Chairman Powell."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"They’ve been, in May and June, stronger than anybody expected, particularly in May."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"I wanted to ask, on the stimulus bill that Senate Republicans are considering, they’ve said that they’re weighing whether to revise the Collins Amendment in order to ease the tier 1 leverage ratio for banks."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Are you concerned that doing so will deplete bank capital, given that the Fed’s stress tests showed that, under the most severe scenarios for economic recovery, that several banks would approach the regulatory minimum capital requirements?"
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,So—okay.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I think what the stress tests showed is that, under the “regular way” stress test, the banks passed."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,But right in the middle of the—of the stress test came the pandemic.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"And so we quickly dropped in three other scenarios, which were, you know, really bad scenarios."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks for doing this today.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"And many of the banks passed, but some didn’t."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we pivoted, and we used the provision that says we can—that says there’s been a material change, and we’re going to ask them to resubmit their capital plans."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,We also stopped buybacks—share buybacks and limited dividends.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,So we’re working through the details of how all of that will work.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,I think we’re going to—I think we’re going to send out the—the stress scenarios on September 30th.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, I would say, that’s—you know, that—that process is working that way."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"And—but you’re making a connection to it, to the Collins Amendment fix."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"So what’s going on there is that, like many other supervisors and regulators around the world, what we found is that our—we have found our banks are strong."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,So we—and that was done very quickly.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"They’re strongly capitalized, with lots of liquidity."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Chair Powell."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Hannah.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,And would you consider both inflation and labor market conditions as part of those outcomes?
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"And specifically, for the labor market, what conditions would you want to see before you think about pulling back stimulus?"
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"So that’s a great discussion that we—we’ve talked about that at past meetings, and I imagine we will at future meetings and haven’t made any decisions yet on that."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, you know, you’ve got a couple ways to go."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,You can tie—you can tie them to dates.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,HANNAH LANG.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"You can say we will—for a specific period of time, we will keep rates at X level."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"And it can either be inflation or it could be an employment goal, as you pointed out."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I think that, you know, there’s attraction in all of those depending on the situation, I think, for obvious reasons."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"You can imagine situations where, you know, where you’d really want to be targeting macroeconomic outcomes."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s also the case, though, that sometimes— sometimes date-based guidance works too."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think it really is very fact specific, and it’s not something we’ve—you know, we haven’t made any decisions on that, so I wouldn’t be standing here telling you we’re going to go this way or that way, you know, should the time come for us to—to change our forward guidance."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Or you can say we’ll keep them there until you achieve a certain macroeconomic goal.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Do you see merits to tying your asset purchases to economic outcomes?
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,And they’ve really been a source of strength in this—in this crisis so far.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"They’re still well capitalized and strong and will be, I think, a source of strength in this situation."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, so I do think that completion of the review would—first of all, it’s something that was a very high priority for—we were really looking forward to completing it, probably, at the June meeting, but it might have been the meeting before that."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"We were right on track, and then we got distracted."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"I—and we weren’t expecting the pandemic, of course."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Nobody was.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,So the pandemic came in.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"So is the idea that you’re trying to have some order to that, that you would announce the findings of the Fed review before then committing to some sort of explicit forward guidance or even yield curve control policy?"
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think it is important to go back and finish that, and I do think that will inform, you know, everything we do going forward."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"To a large extent, we’re already doing the things that are—that are in there."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,This is just a way of—of acknowledging that and putting them in the document.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"I can’t tell you what the exact timing of that will be, but I do think that’s a—that’s a sensible way to think about it."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks very much.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you very much.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHAEL MCKEE.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"I would also tell you, though, that, to—to a very large extent, the—the changes we’ll make to the Statement of [on] Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy are really codifying the way we’re already acting with our policies."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,And they’ve written off bad loans and things like that.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,I wanted to ask just how the framework review is working in tandem with your discussion on explicit forward guidance.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks so much.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"So—but what—what we did earlier was, we—what happens is, the banks run up against their leverage ratio, which is a non-risk-sensitive measure just of the amount of assets on the balance sheet."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"So people put cash in—on deposit at the banks, and they reached the limit of how—how much they could grow or made loans—you know, they—companies drew down loans and deposited cash."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we gave some leverage ratio relief earlier by temporarily—it’s temporary relief—by eliminating, temporarily, Treasuries from the calculation of the—of the leverage ratio."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,This is a—this is another additional thing to do.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"If Congress chooses to do this, we would want it to be explicitly temporary."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"We—in other words, this will not be a permanent change in capital standards."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"We haven’t decided to do it, but it would give us the ability to allow banks to grow their balance sheet and, in doing so, to serve their customers better."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Brian Cheung with Yahoo Finance.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, I have to tell you, if you look around the world, bank regulators—many, many bank regulators around the world have given leverage ratio relief."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s—it’s not, it’s not—what it’s doing is, it’s allowing them to grow their balance sheet in a way that serves their customers."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,That—that’s really what it’s doing.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, again, I would want it to be explicitly temporary if—if we do do it."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Okay, thank you."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,We’ll go to Brian Cheung for the last question.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,BRIAN CHEUNG.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, Swiss National Bank, the Bank of Japan, the European Commission did, the Bank of Canada did, we did."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,I wanted to ask about forward guidance.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you very much.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Chair Powell."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,I wanted to ask about the 13(3) facilities.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"You all have used your emergency authority to buy assets that you can’t directly buy, like corporate bonds, ETFs."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I was just wondering, what is the scope of your authority under 13(3)?"
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,What type of assets are you allowed to buy?
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Could you buy equities through an SPV, for example?"
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, we haven’t—we haven’t looked at that, and we have no—no intention."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks for taking my question.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,We haven’t done any work or thought about buying equities.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, it has to be a broad group of entities."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,There’s a lot in 13(3) about—about the solvency of the borrowers.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, remember, it was rewritten or amended after the financial crisis, and it was written in a way that was—that was to—meant to make it challenging to bail out large financial institutions."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"That’s— there was a lot in there to make sure that, you know, that they were going to be solvent and things like that."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, you know, we have to meet those requirements."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, we haven’t looked and said—tried to say, “What can we buy?” and, you know, “Let’s make a complete list.” You know, we felt that, using these facilities, that we could buy corporate bonds and—and municipal bonds, too."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,So— VICTORIA GUIDA.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, you know, we—we’re bound by the—by the provisions of 13(3), which requires that we make, you know, facilities—programs or facilities of broad applicability, meaning we have to have—it can’t just be focused on one entity."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I just—sorry, just to follow up really quickly."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Victoria Guida with Politico.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,VICTORIA GUIDA.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I would say, some humility is appropriate here in terms of thinking we understand exactly where this is going."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think all we can say today is that there’s—there’s evidence in the high-frequency data, the surveys, and, you know, you’re tracking—you get pictures of spending."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,You get pictures of people’s movements.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,And what we—it looks like we’re seeing a slowdown in the rate of growth.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"That’s—and that might be—it might be short lived, it might not be, you know."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,And it seems to be related to—and the timing of it seems to be related to the spike in cases that began in the middle of June.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Now, I really don’t want to get ahead of where the data are on this."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Hi.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,So we’re just going to have to see.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,And recent experience suggests we—we need to wait and see.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"In any case, there’s clearly a risk that we’re going to see a slowdown in the rate of growth in economic activity and in hiring."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,It might still be at a robust level.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Honestly, we—we will not know until we start to see more data come in."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Victoria Guida.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,We’re going to have to—the data over the next couple of months will answer that question.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"So is it—is it generally supposed to be primarily directed at debt instruments, since you talked about borrowers?"
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"The statute doesn’t say that, but, yeah, you could read the statute that way if you want."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,It wasn’t perfect.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,There were always issues.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,There are always going to be issues within an economy.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,But the labor market really has a long way to go now.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Even with two very strong months of job creation—7½ million jobs between the two months—we still have 14 million people unemployed.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,So it’s just—it’s a long way to go.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"And as—and that leads to a situation where there are so many people looking for jobs, and we have the economy only partially reopened."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, we had a good labor market."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"So there aren’t, you know—until the economy—or as the economy fully reopens, people can go back to work, but—so it’s a tough situation."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, of course, the reported wages went up because of the composition effect—you know, it’s low-paid workers didn’t go back to work, so—they were the ones that got laid off—so average hourly earnings went up."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"But clearly, clearly the pressure—there will not be much upward pressure on wages and compensation at the aggregate level here in a world where there are just an awful lot of people looking for work."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,And the main—so it just underscores again the—the urgency of doing everything we can to restore the labor force and—and to support those who are—who want to be in the labor force but whose jobs have gone away for some period of time as they find other work due to this natural disaster.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Jean Yung.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,JEAN YUNG.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,And I’ve read reports of that.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Well, I—I think that the main thing that tells you is that the—the labor market has a long way to go to recover."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,It—it seems to indicate that inflation could be more volatile in coming—coming months and coming years.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Honestly, we haven’t tried to push it to, you know, what’s the theoretical limit of it."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mean, I think, clearly, it’s—it’s supposed to—it’s supposed to replace lending, you know."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s—that’s really what you’re doing.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,You’re stepping in to provide credit at times when the market has stopped functioning.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s fundamentally what you’re doing with 13(3).
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,And—and so I think you’ve got to—you’ve got to sort of work within that framework.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Greg Robb.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,GREG ROBB.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Hi.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks for taking my question.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Greg Robb from MarketWatch.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Can you hear me?
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Okay.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"One of the things in this crisis that’s unusual is that companies are cutting wages and salaries, and that’s something, you know, we haven’t seen much."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,And I was wondering what the Fed is thinking about this.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, of course, the official labor market reports come out once a month, and no one has had a very good record lately of predicting what they’re going to say."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Mike McKee.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,We want them to remain in place and be available as long as they are needed.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I have a follow-up, sir."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,So they—that—that’s really a question for Congress.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"They—they appropriated that money, and—$454 billion for our facilities, and it’s really a question for them."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,So you’re right that our facilities have not—we haven’t done as much lending as we thought.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, in very substantial measure, that’s because markets started working again fairly soon after we announced the facilities, particularly in the corporate credit facilities, also in the muni—in the muni space, and also in the short-term funding facilities—the three of those that we set up."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,So we didn’t turn out to need the kind of funding that we thought we would.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"On the other hand, it’s important that the facilities stay in place, and that’s why we extended them yesterday."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I—I can’t really speak to what Congress should do with it, but it’s important that the facilities be there and be fully funded in case the needs do arise down the road."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"We don’t see them now, but, in case they do arise, they should be there."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,STEVE LIESMAN.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Has any consideration—thank you.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Has any consideration been given to asking Congress to allow the Federal Reserve to lend to companies in bankruptcy?
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s important that they still stay in place until we’re, you know, very confident that the turmoil from the pandemic and the economic fallout are behind us."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Not that I’m aware of, no."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Is this money doing the best for the nation as a backstop for Federal Reserve programs that don’t seem to be being used all that much right now?
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Mr. Chairman, given—you’ve said several times now that you have lending, not spending, powers."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Well, so our—our dollar swap lines—we introduced those back at the beginning of—of this episode after the pandemic made itself present."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,And dollar funding markets were in very difficult shape at the time.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,And the introduction of the swap lines has really restored dollar funding markets around the world to fairly normal levels of activity.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,And so they kind of served their purpose.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"But we extended them—I guess, yesterday morning— really to facilitate planning by other central banks and just so people will know that those facilities are still there."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"And since, you know, the crisis and the economic fallout from—from the pandemic are far from over, we’re going to leave those in place for the time being."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Given that a lot of the capacity of these programs has not been used and, really, barely used, do you think that some of this money that has been dedicated by the Treasury to the Federal Reserve should be considered to be used by Congress as direct grants to businesses that are in need right now or to households, given that Congress is now saying that money is limited and they shouldn’t take—they do not want to pass a very large stimulus bill?"
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,And we’ll leave them in place until we’re confident that they’re no longer needed.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s just, we want them to be there as a backstop for markets."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Okay.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Steve Liesman.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,STEVE LIESMAN.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Steve Liesman, CNBC."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,I hope that you can hear me.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,There’s nothing that’s going on in the market right now that raises any concerns.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,And how concerned are you about dollar shortages persisting over time through the pandemic?
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Nick Timiraos.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I would say that the response from the fiscal authorities was strong, it was fast, it was broad—and appropriately so."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,And I think we are seeing the results of the earlier strong fiscal actions.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"When you see the spending that’s happening, when you see small businesses staying in business even though the economy hasn’t fully, successfully, sustainably reopened yet in many places, you are seeing what happens with that—that money."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"And so, in—in a broad sense, it’s been well spent."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s kept people in their homes.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s kept businesses in business.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,And that’s all a good thing.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"We went from the lowest levels of unemployment we’d had in 50 years to the highest levels we’ve had in 90 years, and we did it in the space of two months."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think, in the broad scheme of things, that there will be a need both for more support from us and from more fiscal policy."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,You see the ongoing discussions that they’re having.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"And it suggests to me that there’s—you know, that both sides, they’re wrangling over—over various provisions but nonetheless believe that there is a need for some additional fiscal support."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,And the last thing I’ll say is that if the expansion—even if—sorry.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Even if the reopening goes well and many, many people go back to work, it’s still going to take a fairly long time for the parts of the economy that are—that involve lots of people getting together in close proximity."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"And that means that many of the people who were laid off from those industries—and that’s restaurants, you know, bars, hotels, public entertainment, all of those places, travel and accommodation—many of those people are going to find it hard to go back—they can’t go back to their old job."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,There won’t be enough jobs for them.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,So I think those people are going to need support.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Fiscal policy is up to Congress.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"I just will say the following, that, you know, this—this pandemic and its fallout really represents the biggest shock to the U.S. economy in living memory."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"[No response] Nick, are you there?"
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,[No response] UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,[Aside] I didn’t hear you say that.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’ll go to David Gura, NBC."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,DAVID GURA.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Mr. Chairman, thank you very much."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, on your first question, I wouldn’t want to be giving very detailed, specific advice on particular programs and the level they should be at and that kind of thing."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,No doubt you were paying attention when two of your predecessors were up on Capitol Hill just a few days ago answering some questions from—from lawmakers.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,And something we’ve heard a lot is that they could be a disincentive to work.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Both of them addressed that.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,I wonder if you would as well.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"And then, as a follow-up, I wonder what you’ve learned about the degree to which this has led to a widening of the wealth gap in this country, the degree to which maybe people are experiencing two different kinds of—of pandemics here."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Some are getting through this based on what they’ve saved and the jobs that they have.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Others are really struggling to get by.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I wonder what role—what additional role the Fed could have in, sort of, bridging that—that yawning gap."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,And a question they each answered had to do with the continuation of these pandemic unemployment benefits.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,I can’t say what the exact level should be.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Chair Powell, the Fed today decided to extend dollar liquidity swap lines with a number of central banks around the world."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Hi there.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,The pandemic has also left a significant imprint on inflation.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"For some goods, including food, supply constraints have led to notably higher prices, adding to the burden for those struggling with lost income."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"More broadly, however, weaker demand, especially in sectors— such as travel and hospitality—that have been most affected by the pandemic, has held down consumer prices, and, overall, inflation is running well below our symmetric 2 percent objective."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Along with the recent increases in economic activity have come new challenges.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"After declining gradually from a peak near the end of April, the number of COVID-19 cases has increased sharply in many parts of the country since mid-June."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"We have thus entered a new phase in containing the virus, which is essential to protect both our health and our economy."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"As we have emphasized throughout the pandemic, the path forward for the economy is extraordinarily uncertain and will depend in large part on our success in keeping the virus in check."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,This reversal of economic fortune has upended many lives and created great uncertainty about the future.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Indeed, we have seen some signs in recent weeks that the increase in virus cases and the renewed measures to control it are starting to weigh on economic activity."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,A full recovery is unlikely until people are confident that it’s safe to reengage in a broad range of activities.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,The path forward will also depend on policy actions taken at all levels of government to provide relief and to support the recovery for as long as needed.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"The Federal Reserve’s response to this crisis has been guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people, along with our responsibilities to promote the stability of the financial system."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,We are committed to using our full range of tools to support the economy in this challenging time.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,We have held our policy rate near zero since mid-March and have stated that we will keep it there until we are confident that the economy has weathered recent events and is on track to achieve our maximum-employment and price-stability goals.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’ve been purchasing sizable quantities of Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities in order to support orderly conditions in the markets, which are vital to the flow of credit in the economy."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"To sustain smooth market functioning and foster effective transmission of monetary policy to broader financial conditions, we will continue to increase our holdings of Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities at least at the current pace."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"For example, some measures of consumer spending based on debit card and credit card use have moved down since late June, while recent labor market indicators point to a slowing in job growth, especially among smaller businesses."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,These purchases are also fostering more accommodative financial conditions.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"In particular, the rise in joblessness has been especially severe for lower-wage workers, for women, and for African Americans and Hispanics."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"The unemployment rate declined in May and June but, at 11.1 percent, remains far above its level before the outbreak and greater than the peak during the Global Financial Crisis."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Transcript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference July 29, 2020 CHAIR POWELL."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Good afternoon.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,The pandemic continues to cause tremendous human and economic hardship here in the United States and around the world.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"The most important response to this public health crisis has come from our health-care workers, and we remain grateful to them and to the many other essential workers for putting themselves at risk day after day in service to others and to our country."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,All of us have a role to play in our nation’s response to the pandemic.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"At the Federal Reserve, we remain committed to using our tools to do what we can, and for as long as it takes, to provide some relief and stability, to ensure that the recovery will be as strong as possible, and to limit lasting damage to the economy."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"In addition, the downturn has not fallen equally on all Americans, and those least able to bear the burden have been the most affected."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"In recent months, economic activity picked up as the economy began to reopen."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"As a result, household spending looks to have recovered about half of its earlier decline, although spending for services such as air travel and hotels has shown much less of a pickup."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"The recovery in household spending also likely owes to federal stimulus payments and expanded unemployment benefits, which provided substantial and timely support to household incomes."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"In contrast, indicators of business fixed investment have yet to show a recovery."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Even with the improved economic news in May and June, overall activity remains well below its level before the pandemic, and the contraction in real GDP in the second quarter will likely be the largest on record."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,The labor market has followed a similar pattern.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"After precipitous drops in March and April, employment rose strongly in May and June as many people returned to work from temporary layoffs."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"As a result, of the roughly 22 million jobs that had been lost, about one-third had been regained as of the June payroll report."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Many businesses opened their doors, factories restarted production, and more people left their homes to engage in various activities."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,James Politi with the Financial Times.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"The Federal Reserve has also been taking broad and forceful actions to more directly support the flow of credit in the economy for households, for businesses large and small, and for state and local governments."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Businesses could be forced to downsize or close, resulting in further job losses and income losses and worsening the downturn."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"As a reminder, we began this public review of our monetary policy strategy, tools, and communication practices—a first for the Federal Reserve— early last year."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Our purpose has been to take a comprehensive look at how we can best meet our maximum-employment and price-stability objectives in the years ahead, particularly in light of the generally lower level of interest rates around the world."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"As is evident in our current situation, the lower level of interest rates has reduced the scope for the Committee to support the economy by cutting interest rates."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Our plans to conclude this review were, like so many things, delayed by the pandemic."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"At this meeting, my colleagues and I resumed our discussions."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Our focus was on possible enhancements to our Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"This document states our goals, articulates our approach to monetary policy, and serves at the foundation—as the foundation for our policy actions."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,[Clears throat] Excuse me.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"While I do not have any details to share with you today, I am confident that we will continue to make progress and will wrap up our deliberations in the near future."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Everything we do is in service to our public mission.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,We are committed to using our full range of tools to support the economy and to help assure that the recovery from this difficult period will be as robust as possible.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,I will look forward to your questions.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,James Politi.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,JAMES POLITI.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"We understand that the work of the Fed touches communities, families, and businesses across the country."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Without access to credit, families could be forced to cut back on necessities or even lose their homes."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Before taking your questions, I’ll provide an update on our review of our monetary policy framework."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Even so, the current economic downturn is the most severe in our lifetimes."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Preserving the flow of credit is thus essential for mitigating the damage to the economy and promoting the recovery.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Many of our programs rely on emergency lending powers that require the support of the Treasury Department and are available only in very unusual circumstances, such as those we find ourselves in today."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,These programs benefit the economy by providing financing where it is not otherwise available.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"In addition, by serving as a backstop to key credit markets, the programs appear to have significantly increased the extension of credit from private lenders."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"We are deploying these lending powers to an unprecedented extent, enabled in large part by financial backing and support from Congress and the Treasury."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,We will continue to use these powers until we are confident that we are solidly on the road to recovery.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,This week we extended these programs through the end of the year.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"It will take a while to get back to the levels of economic activity and employment that prevailed at the beginning of the year, and it will take continued support from both monetary and fiscal policy to achieve that."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"When the time comes, after the crisis has passed, we will put these emergency tools back in the toolbox."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,The Fed cannot grant money to particular beneficiaries.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,We can only create programs or facilities with broad-based eligibility to make loans to solvent entities with the expectation that the loans will be repaid.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Many borrowers will benefit from these programs, as will the overall economy."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"But for many others, getting a loan that may be difficult to repay may not be the answer."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"In these cases, direct fiscal support may be needed."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Elected officials have the power to tax and spend and to make decisions about where we, as a society, should direct our collective resources."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"The fiscal policy actions that have been taken thus far have made a critical difference to families, businesses, and communities across the country."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"As I have emphasized before, these are lending powers, not spending powers."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s not our role.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Why was that important for the Fed?
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,So I think there will be a need.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you for taking my question.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"I’m wondering if you can be a bit more specific about any risks that you see related to a double-dip recession or signs that the recovery was stalling, or maybe begin to stalling, compared to some of the signs that we were seeing earlier in the summer."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks very much.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Yeah.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,So maybe I’ll talk more broadly about the—the outlook and include your—include your question in it.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, as I mentioned, economic activity and employment picked up beginning in May and right through June and remained well below their levels because, I’d say, job gains have reversed about a third of the job losses from March and April, and consumer spending has reversed about a half of the drop."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hey, Chair Powell."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"So—but, nonetheless, those were—those were sooner and stronger than we expected."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"And that brings us to a new—a new point here, which is, we need to—in addition to dealing with the health crisis—we have to remember, this is really a health crisis, and these are people who are having the coronavirus, and it’s taking a terrible toll, so we’ve got to deal with the economic ramifications of that."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"So what we’re seeing is that we monitor quite a lot of what we—what we think of as sort of nonstandard, high-frequency data."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"That’s become a very important thing, even more important than usual in the work that we do."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"And what that data show, on balance, is that the pace of the recovery looks like it has slowed since the cases began that spike in June."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,So some measures of consumer spending based on credit card and debit card data have moved down.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Recent labor market indicators point to a slowing in job growth, particularly among smaller businesses."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Hotel occupancy rates have flattened out.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"So—but what happened then was, along with that positive data, we got—we got the virus increases starting in the middle of June in lots and lots of states around the country."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Consumer surveys, by the way, which had dropped very sharply when the pandemic arrived and then moved back up sharply— they look like they may be softening again now."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,RACHEL SIEGEL.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Okay, thank you."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Yes.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,So—the situation with coins is that the—the quantity of coins is going up but was adequate before the pandemic.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"The problem is, the circulation kind of stopped because stores were closed, banks were closed."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"It just—customers weren’t spending, they were—so the coins stopped moving in the system."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we’ve been working for—ever since that began to happen, we saw it happening right away."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,We’ve been working to try to—try to reverse that disruption of the supply chain and restore normal circulation for our coins.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we’re working with the U.S. Mint, which is the issuing authority, to address the issue."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Rachel Siegel.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Just last week, the Mint—you may have seen—issued a statement asking for the public’s help in keeping coins circulating, and various people, you know, went and put their coins back into circulation."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,We’re in frequent communication with the banks and with the—with the armored carriers trying to get back to where we need to be.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,So we do think the inventories are building up.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, the Mint—the Mint is making coins as fast as they can, but—but, you know, things happen with—in the factory environment: Someone will come to work with COVID—I think this has happened in—in almost every factory environment around the country—and then they’ll shut down for a day, and then they come back, and that kind of thing."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,So—so we’re closely monitoring it.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s—you know, it’s a significant issue."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’ve—we’ve got a lot of resources on it, and we do feel like we’re—we’re making progress."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"We also created a coin task force with all of the stakeholders—you know, banks and, you know, the armored carriers, the banking community, credit unions, everybody in the—in the coin supply chain."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,There are still some areas of strength.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Housing and motor vehicle sales have still been strong.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Nonetheless, on balance, it looks like the data are pointing to a slowing in the pace of the recovery."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"And now that the—that the cases have spiked again—again, the early data, the high-frequency data suggest that there is a slower pace of growth, at least for now."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,We don’t know how deep or how long that will be.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,So it’s such an important sentence.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,We just decided that it needed to be in our—in our postmeeting statement.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s so fundamental.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, I think we can’t say it enough."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s—it’s really important.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"You saw that in the—during the lockdown when we got cases way down, and you saw the economy reopening, and you saw spending go up and hiring go up."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’re—you know, you can think of it as three stages."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Then there was the reopening, and we would expect that many, many people would go back to work."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Those whose jobs could be done without—you know, without exposure to lots of people in tight groups, they should have been—they should be able to go back to work during that phase fairly quickly."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"But that would depend on being able to keep the virus under control, which will depend on wearing masks and other social-distancing measures."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,So that’s where we are.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s such an important factor.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"But they’re going to need support if they’re to be able to pay their bills, to continue spending money, to remain in their current rental house or—or apartment or a house if they own it."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s—it’s in—we’re all talking about it, so we thought it really had to be in the statement."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"There’s the lockdown, and we know what that looks like, and we’ll get the data, I guess, later this week on GDP being down very historically large amounts."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,And you’re seeing that again now.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, I think we feel that it—it might be, the most central fact or the most central driver of the path of the economy right now is the virus."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"But I want to stress, it’s—it’s too early to say both how large that is and how sustained it will be."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"We just don’t know yet, because we have to wait for—to see the, you know, the actual data on spending and employment come in, and—but this—this is what we’re seeing, and, of course, we’re monitoring it very carefully."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,And I’d be remiss in not stressing this enough.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,The path of the economy is going to depend to a very high extent on the course of the virus and on the measures that we take to keep it in check.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,That is just a very fundamental fact about our economy right now.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,The two things are not in conflict.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, social-distancing measures and fast reopening of the economy, they actually go together."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,They’re not in competition with each other.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,So— MICHELLE SMITH.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Chris Rugaber.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,CHRISTOPHER RUGABER.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Hi.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Well, just to follow up on that a bit—and thanks for taking my question—you added the sentence into the statement about the course of the economy depends on the path of the virus."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Is this—do you feel this idea, or this view, is not widely enough understood?"
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Do you feel—you had warned back in May that too early reopening or an incautious reopening might harm the economy.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Do you feel that message was not heard, and that some of these reopenings took place perhaps sooner than they should have?"
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"I wonder if you can give us an update on the coin shortage that you talked to lawmakers about last month and what, if anything, that tells us about the, sort of, economic circulatory system."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"People aren’t going out to restaurants, bars, gas stations, pharmacies, and beauty salons as much."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Scott Horsley from NPR.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"We saw that the biggest wage increases were going to people at the bottom end of the—of the wage spectrum for the last couple of years of that 10-year, 8-month expansion."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"So a tight labor market is probably the best thing that the Fed can foster to—to go after that—that problem, which is a—a serious one."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"And now, Nick Timiraos."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,NICK TIMIRAOS.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Yeah.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,[Inaudible] Journal.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,We saw what happened to people at—at the lower end of the income spectrum late in the last expansion.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Chair Powell, you have described your asset purchase objective as stabilizing markets."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"The other question I have is, what is your strategy going to be with respect to using asset purchases to support your macroeconomic objectives going forward?"
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"So you’re right, the asset purchases in—in their current size really sprang from severe dysfunction in the Treasury and MBS markets at the beginning of the market reaction to the pandemic."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"And thanks to those purchases, we have substantially restored—not fully, but substantially restored functioning markets."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,This is absolutely critical.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"That market is really one of the—it’s part of the absolute bedrock of the global financial markets, and it’s—it’s essential that it—that it work well, and it is doing so now."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"And with markets having stabilized, aren’t the asset purchases now doing more than address market function by supporting your macroeconomic objectives?"
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Our part of it is to—is to push as hard as we can on our employment mandate while keeping price stability.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"So it’s—it’s a critical, critical problem for our society, but one that really falls mainly to fiscal policy and other policies."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"If you’re on the wrong side of those forces, it’s been—your income has stagnated."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"In terms of inequality, really—so I think it’s fair to say that the burdens of the pandemic have fallen on, heavily—they’ve fallen on everyone, but they’ve fallen very heavily on people who work in the service industries in relatively low-paying jobs."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"So there was a—a figure that came out of some of our research that was that if you make $40,000 a year or less, then 40 percent—you had a 40 percent chance of losing your job in April and May."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"So it’s falling very heavily on—on people who have the least financial wherewithal to, you know, to bear that."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,And that happens to be heavily skewed to minorities and to women.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,So that’s just what the pandemic is doing.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, in terms of what we’re doing, what we’re trying to do is create an environment in the financial markets and in the economy where those people have the best chance they can have to go back to work to their old job or to a new job."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s really what we’re doing.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Everything we do is directed at that.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, the—I would say—I would say one last thing on inequality."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"That is, inequality is a—is an issue—has been a growing issue in our country and in our economy for four decades."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,And you see it—it has many faces.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,You see it in the relative flattening-out of—of incomes for people in low and—lower and middle incomes as compared to those at the top.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,You see it in low mobility where people—where the chances of moving up from the bottom to the middle or the top have declined and are lower than they are in other comparable wealthy countries.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"So it’s a serious economic problem for the United States, but it’s—it’s got underlying causes that are not related to monetary policy or to our response to the pandemic."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Again, four decades of evidence suggests it’s about globalization."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s about the flattening-out of educational attainment in the United States compared to our other competitor countries.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s about technology advancing, too."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we’ve always said, though, that we understand, accept, and are fine with the fact that—that those purchases are also fostering a more accommodative stance of monetary policy, which would tend to support macroeconomic outcomes."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"So it’s doing both, and—and, you know, we’ve understood that for some time."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"It was the best labor market in 50 years, they told us."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"I don’t have the daily face-to-face interaction with anybody else at BlackRock or—or, as you can see, three phone calls in the course of a few months."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"I was wondering if you could tell us a little bit about what you talked about, and, if the topic of those conversations was the corporate credit facilities, how did you handle potential conflicts of interest during those conversations?"
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Well, so—so BlackRock is just our agent."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, we make the policy decisions in conjunction with our colleagues, and they just execute our—our plans."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"I actually don’t remember exactly what I would have been talking with him about, but he’s a—you know, he’s the head of a major service provider."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,He generally checks in to find out whether we’re okay with the quality of the service that—that BlackRock is providing.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,It wasn’t very many.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I think, you know, their conflicts are managed extremely carefully in the contractual arrangements we have with them."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"You talked to Larry Fink at BlackRock in March, April, and May, according to your public calendars."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, again, I would have—I—I can’t recall exactly what those conversations were, but they were—they would have been about what are you seeing in the markets and things like that too—you know, generally exchanging information."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s—I’d say that’s his main objective when we talk.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Okay, thank you."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,We’ll go to Scott Horsley.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s not—the programs are not structured exactly like the—the QE programs were in the last—in the last financial—in the aftermath of the last financial crisis.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,SCOTT HORSLEY.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,And he’s—he’s typically trying to make sure that—that we are getting good service from the company that he founded and leads.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you for taking my question.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we gave forward guidance on—on both of those things, which the markets appear to understand, and market pricing is consistent with those."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Nonetheless, they are supporting accommodative financial conditions."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,I think it’s—it’s clear that that’s the case.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"In terms of our strategy, you know, that just remains to be seen."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"We—as you know, we’ve spent a lot of time in meetings this year looking at the tools that we have to adjust our current stance of policy."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,We do feel that our current monetary policy stance is the appropriate one.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Chair Powell."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, we cut rates close to zero right at the beginning."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"We—we ramped up asset purchases, and those—those have really helped."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Those were more focused on buying longer-run securities.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,So we think we’re—we think that our—our policy stance is a good one.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’re, of course, prepared to adjust that stance as appropriate and when we deem it as appropriate to—to better foster achievement of our goals, of course."
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Okay.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,Jeanna.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,JEANNA SMIALEK.
2020-07-29,Press Conf - Full Text,The current purchases are all across the—the maturity spectrum.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,So that’s half of them.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, 11 million— particularly if the pace of, of returning to work slows down, it’s going to leave a large—a large group of people."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,It just is.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s—you know, it’s millions of people."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,And we don’t really know how long that will be.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,And it’ll be very meaningful from a macroeconomic standpoint.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"As I mentioned, we had 11 million—something like 11 million people in the payroll survey have gone back to work out of 22 million who went—who lost their jobs in March and April."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,And our commitment is not to forget those people.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, we’re getting some loans made, and we’re hopeful that we’ll, that we’ll clarify this and that credit will continue to flow."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And even after, if we do lift off, we will keep policy accommodative until we actually have a moderate overshoot of inflation for some time."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So those are powerful commitments that we think will, will support the full recovery, including those people, as long as it takes."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Mike McKee.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHAEL MCKEE.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And that’s going to be challenging for, for some time."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Mr. Chairman, Michael McKee from Bloomberg Radio and Television."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"As I mentioned, we want—you know, the sense of our forward guidance is that policy will remain, as we’ve said, highly accommodative until the— until the expansion is well along—really, very close to our goals."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So there will also be the—you know, the places that are affected that way."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"But I would say, the, the likely path is that the—that the expansion will continue."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Based on what you were just saying about keeping policy accommodative for a very long time into the recovery, lower-for-longer as far out as three years in your latest projections, is that basically it for the Fed?"
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s, it’s not an easy thing to do."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Chris Rugaber.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,CHRISTOPHER RUGABER.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, thanks for taking my question."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Chair Powell, you’ve talked a couple of times about parts of the economy that may not recover as fast as we’ve seen so far."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And it’s, as I said, it’s well along, and it’ll move most easily through the parts of the economy—it’ll still take some time, but the parts of the economy that weren’t exactly directly affected, that didn’t involve getting people in large groups together to feed them, to fly them around, to put them in hotels, do entertainment, things like that—those are going to be the places that are—that are very challenging."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Presumably you’re referring to airlines, hotels, other sections—you know, parts of the economy that rely on close contact."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Is that sector large enough to say keep unemployment above—you know, far above your maximum goals?"
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Are you expecting that to come back with a vaccine?
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Or are a lot of those folks going to have to find, you know, new jobs in new industries?"
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,And should we expect the Fed will keep rates at zero until all of that reallocation is done?
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Yes, we—of course, we can’t be—we can’t be really sure we know the answers to those questions."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"How are you thinking about that, in terms of its overall impact?"
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"In other words, since interest rates are your main tool, the things you can do would push down on interest rates."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,That didn’t happen.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, frankly, it hasn’t really happened around the world since then."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"That doesn’t mean that it won’t happen, but—and so, of course, it’s something that we monitor carefully."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"After the financial crisis, we started a new—a whole division of the Fed to focus on financial stability."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,We look at it in every—from every perspective.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,The FOMC gets briefed on a quarterly basis.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"At the Board here, we talk about it more or less on an ongoing basis, so it is something we monitor."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, I would say, it was notable for the lack of the emergence of, of some sort of a financial bubble—a housing bubble or some kind of a bubble, the popping of which could threaten the expansion."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"But I don’t know that the—that the connection between asset purchases and, and financial stability is a particularly tight one."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,We’ll be checking carefully as we go.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, by the way, the kinds of tools that we would use to address those sorts of things are not really monetary policy."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,It would be more tools that strengthen the financial system.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Don Lee.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And the question is, how do you dial that in?"
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,DON LEE.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So—but again, we won’t be—we won’t be just assuming that."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, I would say, if you look at the long experience of, you know, the 10-year, 8-month expansion, the longest in our recorded history, it included an awful lot of quantitative easing and low rates for 7 years."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"These were questions that were very much in the air a decade ago and more when, when the Fed first started doing QE."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,These are—these are not new questions.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Well, no, I wouldn’t—I certainly would not say that we’re out of ammo."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Not at all.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, first of all, we, we do have lots of tools."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’ve got the lending tools, we’ve got the balance sheet, and we’ve got further forward guidance—further forward guidance."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we, we—there’s still plenty more that we can do."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"We do think that our—that our, our rate policy stance is an appropriate one to support the economy."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,We think it’s powerful.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, as I mentioned, you know, this is the kind of guidance that will provide support for the economy over time, the idea being that policy will remain highly accommodative until the recovery is well along—really, very close to our goals—and then will remain accommodative even after we lift off."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I think that’s, that’s a really strong place for, for rate policy to be."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, again, we have the other margins that we can still use."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, no."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Certainly, we’re not out of ammo."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHAEL MCKEE.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Well, if I could follow up, in terms of the balance sheet, are you concerned that your actions are more likely to produce asset price inflation than goods-and- services inflation?"
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"In other words, are you risking a bubble on Wall Street?"
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, so, of course we monitor financial conditions very carefully."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,But is it really—is it the case now that the only additional stimulus that can come to the economy is from the fiscal side?
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"We also want them to take some risk, obviously, because that was the point of it."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And that involves, as I mentioned, you know—I think the more social distancing we can preserve as we go back into the workforce—wearing masks, keeping our distance, that kind of thing—the better we’ll be able to get economic activity back up close to where it was."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,They’re trained to make good loans.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"In, in terms of the stress tests, so I really don’t have any—you know, we’re getting ready quite soon to be making announcements and saying things publicly."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"There’s not much I can say with you—nothing, really, that I can say that’s—on that today."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,I don’t have anything for you.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Chris Condon.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,CHRISTOPHER CONDON.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"That’s something we can all do that will limit the spread and let people go back to work, avoid major outbreaks, and things like that."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you, Michelle."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"You have emphasized many times, including today, that the Fed can only lend and not spend, and sometimes the latter is what’s really needed."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"But to the extent that a $600 billion lending program for small and midsize companies could help, what exactly is wrong with the design or function of the Main Street Lending Program, which has purchased just, I think, $1.4 billion in loans so far?"
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Eric Rosengren at the Boston Fed has said recently that Congress should clarify how much risk it wants the program to take.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"But Congress has already appropriated substantial funds for the 13(3) programs, and these are funds that are explicitly designed to absorb losses."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Meanwhile, my colleagues who cover the banking sector say they’re being told by commercial banks that the Treasury Department is advising them to target zero losses—zero losses in Main Street Program loans."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, if I may, why is it that the Federal Reserve, the Congress, and the Treasury apparently cannot agree on a loss tolerance that should be applied to the Main Street Lending Program in a way that would allow badly needed credit to reach these companies?"
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Good afternoon, Chairman Powell."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And the main thing, again, is wearing a mask and keeping your distance while you’re in the workforce."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,And I think we should do those things that we control to make sure that we can recover as quickly as possible.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,We just don’t know.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we’re learning to, to engage in economic activity."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Chair Powell, I’d like to ask you about the labor market."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"All of this recovery that we’ve seen is in a context where—you know, where people are still at risk of, of catching it, and yet we’re able to resume lots and lots of economic activities."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"I do think, though, there are areas of the economy that are just going to really struggle until we have an—a vaccine that’s, that’s in wide—you know, wide usage and is, is widely trusted."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,And those are the ones where people were getting really closely—close together.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"I also think testing—to the extent you have cheap and rapid testing, you can do a lot with that in the workforce."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,You can—you can build confidence in the workforce if you have regular—very regular testing that doesn’t cost very much and you get the results really quickly.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"If you do that, you’ll be able to open a lot of workforces, particularly in cities where the overall case numbers are quite low."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,And that will help a lot.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I think we’re, we’re going to be finding lots and lots of ways to get out towards—you know, as far as we can."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"There’s always going to be that—for, for some time, there’s going to be certain activities that will be—that will be hard to, to resume."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I, I think that’s the only way I can say it."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I think trying to—you know, we all—when we make a forecast, we make assessments about that, but it’s really hard to say."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,There is no template here.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"There’s no—you know, there’s no experience with this."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, frankly, for the last 60 days or so, the economy’s recovered faster than expected."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,And that may continue or not.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,So you should expect that they—and we expect that they will do some underwriting.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Sure.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"It, it reaches the whole nation."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, and the CARES Act is quite specific in keeping all of the terms of, of section 13(3) in effect, including the requirement that we, you know, gather good evidence that the borrower is solvent."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"This was—this law was amended in, you know, under—in Dodd-Frank, and the idea was, was to make it challenging and put hurdles in place before we made loans—at the time, the thinking was to banks."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So now we—now we’re using that same law for, for smaller business borrowers, and, you know, it doesn’t—it’s not a perfect fit."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, and, I would also just say, for many borrowers, they’re in a situation where their business is still relatively shut down, and they won’t be able to service a loan, and so they may need more fiscal support."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Having said that, we’re, we’re continuing to work to, to improve Main Street, to make it more broadly available—make it pretty much to any company that needs it and that can service a loan."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,CHRISTOPHER CONDON.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,And can you just very briefly address the reports that the Treasury is advising banks to target zero losses?
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"If you look at the law under section 13(3), it’s very clear that we are to make loans only to solvent borrowers."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Is that appropriate?
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,I can’t say.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,I don’t—I don’t know about that.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,I haven’t heard those reports.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, again, if you think about it, we, we weren’t—we’re, we’re going to have to go through the banking system to do this."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,We—we’re not going to have a hundred thousand or a million loan officers working for the Fed and the Treasury.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we’re going to go through the banking system, and the banks—banks like to make good loans."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s what they do.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"I just would say that, you know, this is 13(3)."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"I, I can’t really comment directly on that."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,I don’t—I saw what President Rosengren said.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s got more than half of the banking industry assets signed up among the banks that are part of it, and it’s making loans."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,The number is more like—it’s close to $2 billion now.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,So the numbers are going up.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Banks are joining; borrowers are coming.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,And it’s significant.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s, it’s relatively small now, but it can scale up in response to economic conditions, should that be— should that be appropriate."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, if you look out in the lending world, surveys generally find that, that firms are not citing credit constraints as a top problem."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And that, that is a lot of PPP, bank credit lines, and syndicated loans."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,There’s a lot of credit being let out there.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,So—but you’re right.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"We, we are looking at some things."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,We’re looking at—some lenders are concerned about the underwriting expectations.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,So banks are going to—their approach is likely to be that they’re going to underwrite this loan roughly the same as they underwrite any loan.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"They’re keeping part of it, and, you know, what, what we want to do is make sure that—that they know that they should take the payment deferrals and other things in, in place, and also that—you know, it’s, it’s really—it’s really a, a facility for, for companies or borrowers that, that don’t have access to, to “regular way” borrowing now."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Otherwise, why would we need Main Street?"
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,So that’s what we're working on.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we’ll be doing some, some—we’ll be making some changes in that respect."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, a couple things about Main Street."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"As you know, in August there were about 30 million persons claiming unemployment benefits."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,I wonder how you reconcile that and what you think the actual labor market conditions are.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,I wanted to ask about commercial real estate.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"I, I know you had mentioned before how you weren’t sure if there was a way the Fed could support CRE borrowers."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,But I was just wondering if you had—if you’ve had any other continuing discussions on that and if there’s any potential way that the Fed could step in in that area.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,So thank you for that question.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, we’ve actually spent quite a bit of time on this as Secretary Mnuchin, I think, mentioned the other day."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,And I’ll say just a couple things.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks so much for taking my question.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"First, you know, our facilities are essentially always—they have to be, under the law—broad based and not so much targeting any single sector."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,So the TALF takes commercial mortgage-backed securities and SBA commercial real estate deals.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,And the New York Fed purchases agency CMBSs directly.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"In addition, I would say, Main Street helps businesses pay their rent, you know."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we’re, we’re helping real estate, you know, in a number of other ways—commercial real estate."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Also, CMBS issuance has resumed."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Spreads have tightened on CMBS.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,There are a couple of issues.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Also, it’s important to remember that CRE, commercial real estate, benefits from several of our existing facilities."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Chair Powell."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,HANNAH LANG.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Hannah Lang.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,I wouldn’t.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, so I would just say, the right—in our discussions the last couple of days, the whole Committee, everybody on the Committee is very supportive of the Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy and what’s in there—very, very broad support, unanimous support for that."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Everyone sees the, the changes in the underlying economy and sees, in their own way, the need to address those—and including the changes we made to the employment mandate and to inflation so that we’re now at flexible average inflation targeting."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Of course, there would be—this is—you know, we’re the first major central bank to adopt this framework."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"There’s no cookbook, and we—you know, this is the first guidance under our new framework."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, of course there would be a wide range of views, and you would expect that."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,And it’s actually a healthy thing.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,So I welcome that discussion.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"I would also say this: You know, this is all about credibility, and we understand perfectly that we have to earn credibility."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"This, this facility—this, this framework has to—we have to support it with our actions."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,And I think today is a very good first step in doing that.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"It is strong, powerful guidance."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,It is—it ties in very nicely with the Statement of [on] Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"We had quite a robust discussion, and there are, there are different ideas on how to do this, but I—that’s just, that’s just the way it is when you have a diverse group of highly thoughtful and effective people."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,And so I’m pleased with where it came out.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"One is just that commercial properties with CMBS loans often have covenants—uniformly, I think, have covenants that forbid them to take on more debt."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,And I wouldn’t have it any other way.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So you have a situation, and you have a situation where, where you—without a legal change or some kind of an innovation that defies discovery so far, you’re—you have a hard time providing mass relief with regard to real estate that’s in, in commercial mortgage-backed securities."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,We’re still looking.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we want inflation to be—we want it to be 2 percent, and we want it to average 2 percent."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So if inflation averages 2 percent, the public will expect that, and that’ll be what’s built into interest rates."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,And that’s just—that’s all we want.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,So we’re not looking to have high inflation.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,We just want inflation to average 2 percent.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And that means that, you know, in a downturn, these days, what happens is, inflation, as has happened now—it moves down well below 2 percent."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And that means that we’ve said for, for—we would like to see and we will conduct policies so that inflation moves, for some time, moderately above 2 percent."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"If you, if you look at many, many large jurisdictions around the world, you are seeing that phenomenon."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So it won’t be—these won’t be large overshoots, and they won’t be permanent but to help anchor inflation expectations at 2 percent."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, nonetheless, the economic importance of it is, is large."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, those are the people we’re serving, and, you know, we serve them best if we can actually achieve average 2 percent inflation, we believe."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,And that’s why we changed our framework.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you very much.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks very much.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Great.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, yes, it’s, it’s a challenging concept for a lot of people."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,This is what’s happening all over the world.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And this isn’t some idle, you know, academic theory."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,And then the Fed will have less room to cut rates to support the economy.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"I would say, it may be that further support for commercial real estate will require further action for Congress—from Congress."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"For the last question, we’ll go to Brian Cheung."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,BRIAN CHEUNG.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Chairman Powell."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,So it seems like a lot of the new inflation framework is about shaping inflation expectations.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,But the average American who might be watching this might be confused as to why the Fed is overshooting inflation.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So what’s your explanation to Main Street, to average people what the Fed is trying to do here and what the outcome would be for those on Main Street?"
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"That’s a very, very important question, and I actually spoke about that in my Jackson Hole remarks a couple weeks ago."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s not intuitive to people.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"It is intuitive that, that high inflation is a bad thing."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s less intuitive that inflation can be too low.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And the way I would explain it is, is that inflation that’s too low will mean that interest rates are lower."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"There’s an expectation of future inflation that’s built into every interest rate, right?"
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And to the extent inflation gets lower and lower and lower, interest rates get lower and lower."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,So we’re still working on it.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Yet the BLS jobs report for August showed about 13½ million unemployed, only about 6 million more than before the pandemic."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"But I would say this: I am blessed —with having a Committee of highly thoughtful people who bring diverse life experiences and diverse careers, and, of course, diverse views to our work."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"I wouldn’t—I don’t want to comment particularly on, on the two dissenters, but they, they consent—they dissented from, of course, different perspectives, and, and that should be clear."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,DON LEE.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Well, if I could follow up, is—is it the Fed’s aim to get back to 3.5 percent or even lower?"
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Yes, absolutely."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, I, I can’t be precise about a particular number, but let me just say, there was a lot to like about 3½ percent unemployment."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s not a magic number.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"No one would say that number is the touchstone or that is, you know, maximum employment."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,But the level is still quite high.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"I would just say, you asked about 3½ percent."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"It showed labor force participation coming up as—up above many estimates of its trend, as people who’d been out of the labor force were being pulled into a tight job market."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"There’s a lot to like about a tough—a tight job market, particularly in a world where we didn’t see inflation."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, yes, we’d love to get back to that."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mean, I would say, we would like to get back—rather than to a particular number, we’d like to get back to a strong labor market where wages are moving up, where people can find work, where labor force participation is holding up nicely."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s what we’d really love to get back to.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Now, of course we would—we need inflation to perform in line with, with our framework."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"But the good news is, we think we can have quite low unemployment without raising troubling inflation."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"A 3½ percent unemployment rate showed, you know, gains being shared very widely across the income spectrum—in fact, going more to people at the bottom end of the spectrum."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,So the improvement has been quite substantial under any measurement.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"On the other hand, by that metric, the, the unemployment rate would have been in the—in the 20s in, in April."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"If you add those back, the level of unemployment’s probably 3 percent higher."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, I mean, I think the overall picture—take a step back from this."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"The overall picture is clear, and that is that the labor market has been recovering, but that it’s a long way—a long way from maximum employment."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think that’s, that’s the bottom line on it."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, within that, though—take claims in particular."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"The number of claims, the quantity of claims, and, frankly, the fact that PUA claims are new—the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance claims—that’s a new system that had to be set up."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"The actual counting of the claims is, is volatile, and, and it’s very difficult to take much signal about the particular level."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, you know, because people were setting those systems up, and when they got them set up, they counted them all at once and things like that."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think, though, what you’ve seen is that the level of—certainly the level of initial claims has declined very sharply from the very high levels of March and April and is now at a lower level—continues either to be flat or gradually decline."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s worth noting—and that’s good—it’s worth noting that that level is maybe five times the level of what claims were.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Claims were around 200,000; now they’re 900,000, in that range, weekly for, for initial claims."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So that just tells you, the labor market has improved, but it’s a long, long way from maximum employment, and it will be some time getting back there."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,I think that’s the best way to think about it.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"In many parts of the economy there’s just a lot of disruption, and it’s, it’s really hard to say precisely where we are."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"I’ll give you another example with—you know, we say unemployment’s 8.4 percent."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"But if you count those who are—who are misidentified as, as employed when they’re actually unemployed and you add back some part of the participation number—so if you were—if you had a job and you were in the labor force in February and you lost it because of the pandemic, some of you are now being reported as out of the labor force."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"But I—you know, I would—I would more look at those people as unemployed."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"That’s their—they’re not they’re sort of on, on two sides of the, of the discussion."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, you know, we look at—look at that in many, many different variables, and we ask ourselves whether those variables are—those labor market conditions are consistent with our assessments of what would constitute maximum employment."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,And that would include all of the things that we’re talking about.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Greg Robb.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,GREG ROBB.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Greg Robb from MarketWatch."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,What it means is maximum employment.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks for this.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And you said that it’s powerful, but you’ve already have two dissent—two dissenting voters on it."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I was wondering if there’s other, other people who argued against it."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,And what do you say to the two who dissented?
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"It looks like President Kashkari wanted a simpler forward guidance, and President Kaplan thought that the current guidance you have was fine for now."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, like, how did you argue back on those, on those arguments?"
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,I want to go back to the new forward guidance that you have.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"As I mentioned earlier, it doesn’t mean a particular headline unemployment number."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"We are assigned “maximum employment.” Now, what does that mean?"
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we do that not just because it’s interesting and important, but because it’s important for the economy and important for our mandate."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Nancy Marshall-Genzer with Marketplace."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Chair Powell, I want to follow up on the wealth gap issue."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,I know you were—that you have limited tools.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"But are there things that you can do, possibly in the area of research and maybe expand your research on racial economic gaps?"

2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, we do—we are gifted with a, a substantial group of researchers who really cover the waterfront."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we do a significant amount of research on racial disparities in—across multiple variables, including wealth, as you asked about."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,So we do that.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we also—remember, we have our Division of Consumer and Community Affairs, which is present in communities around the country."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,And the Reserve Banks all have very active community affairs groups.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,They’re present in communities around the country.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,So it wasn’t just the Fed—Fed Listens events.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s more, just, over a long period of time we, we are in contact with people in those communities to understand their experience of the economy."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"We serve all Americans, and we know that."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we’re going to use our tools to, to reflect that fact."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So the answer is “yes.” We do quite a bit of research, and I suppose we could do more, but we really do a lot."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we contribute to those fields and those assessments of, of the state of the economy."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Nancy Marshall-Genzer.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, on the first one, what’s happening is basically we’re learning to live with—right now, we're learning to live with COVID, which still spreads."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"First of all, if we don’t get a vaccine until well into next year, what does that mean for the economy?"
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks for taking my question.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Jeanna Smialek, New York Times."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"I was wondering, you beefed up your language on financial stability in the long-run statement that you unveiled with your Jackson Hole speech last month."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,I’m wondering if you could kind of walk us through how you think about financial stability concerns as a factor in guiding and interpreting increases.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, would financial stability concerns on their own be enough to merit changes in the fed funds rate?"
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Or would they have to come in conjunction with an overheating on inflation or some sort of dramatic drop in the unemployment rate?
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"If you could, sort of, give us an outline of your thinking there, please."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Chair Powell."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And today we said that we’d “be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of our [the Committee’s] goals.” But you asked specifically about, about financial stability."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,One thing I would say is that financial—that monetary policy should not be the first line of defense—is not the first line of defense on financial stability.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"We look to more appropriate tools in the first instance as a first line of defense, and those would be regulation, supervision, high capital, high liquidity, stress testing—all of those things, macroprudential tools."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"All of those things are, are really the first line of defense on financial stability."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"But we always leave open the idea that we will not ignore those kinds of risks and other kinds of risks, more broadly, that could impede the attainment of our goals in, in setting monetary policy."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So that’s, that’s really how we think about it, but principally that, you know, other tools are the—are the frontline, as I mentioned."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,JEANNA SMIALEK.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So what we said in our Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy was that the Committee’s policy decisions reflect “its longer-run goals, its medium-term outlook, and its assessment[s] of the balance of risks, including risks to the financial system that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s goals.” So that’s what we said about financial stability."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,JEANNA SMIALEK.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Jeanna.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,NICK TIMIRAOS.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"If I could—if I could follow up, I suppose the question I have is, why give guidance on one policy tool but not give guidance on the other policy tool when the Fed has talked about those two policy tools working together?"
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we, we think our—we think our policy stance is appropriate today, and we’re prepared to adjust it going forward as we, as we see appropriate."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,And today we believe that particularly this very strong forward guidance—very powerful forward guidance that we’ve announced today will provide strong support for the economy.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Effectively, we’re saying that rates will remain highly accommodative until the economy is far along in its recovery, and that, that should be a very powerful statement in supporting economic activity."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Now we’re buying $120 billion in securities per month across the—across the Treasury curve.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s also adding to accommodation.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"We do have the flexibility to adjust that tool and, and the rate tool and, and other tools as well."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"But as for right now, we think—we think that our policy setting is appropriate to support the expansion."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"We did—we said from the beginning that we would first try to provide some support and stability and relief in the first phase of the crisis, the acute phase, and then we would support the expansion when it came."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Well, it’s here."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,And it’s well along.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And so that’s why we changed our guidance today, and we do have the flexibility to do more when we think it’s appropriate."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,NICK TIMIRAOS.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Just to follow up quickly, if, if other tools aren’t forthcoming, would financial stability concerns in and of themselves be enough to warrant a rate hike?"
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,And we’re prepared to adjust our plans as appropriate.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And that, that would be—that would be the test."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I don’t think there’s any conflict between those two because, you know, the, the way they’re set up, the projections don’t show the out years."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"You asked about confidence, and I would say that this, this very strong, very powerful guidance shows both our confidence and our determination."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,It shows our confidence that we can reach this goal and our determination to do so.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,STEVE LIESMAN.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"I’m sorry, if I could just follow up without being simplistic about this."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"But why wouldn’t—if the Committee was confident that it could reach its new goal of aiming for inflation above 2 percent, why wouldn’t one of those years at least show inflation being above 2 percent on the median forecast?"
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,So that’s the test.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Because it—we think, looking at everything we know about inflation dynamics in the United States and around the world over recent decades, we expect it will take some time."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,And we’ll still have an area of the economy—a big area of the economy—that struggles.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,There will be slack in the economy.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"The economy will be below maximum employment, below full demand."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,And that will tend to wear—to put downward pressure on inflation.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we think that once we get up closer to maximum employment, we think that inflation will come back, generally."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, I mean, that’s sort of what happened during the last long expansion."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s a slow process, but—but there is a process there."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"We expect that the economy will recover quickly now, but that that pace will slow as, as people go back to work."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"It says that we expect that the current setting of, of our rates will be—what we expect [is] that it will be appropriate until such time as we reach 2 percent inflation, that we feel that labor market conditions are consistent with our assessment of maximum employment, and that we’re on track to achieve inflation moderate—inflation moderately above."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, you know, you know what the guidance says."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,We reach 2 percent—I guess the median is 2 percent at the end of 2023.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, it’s not something that we’ve done."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"We do monitor financial stability concerns, of course, intensely and regularly."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"We try to use our other tools on them, but we, we do keep them in mind as we think about monetary policy."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Steve Liesman.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,STEVE LIESMAN.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Mr. Chairman, I wonder if you could help me understand how the projections of the Committee line up with the goals of the Committee."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,You’ve now altered the projections to—the statement to aim for inflation above 2 percent.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"But when I look at the SEP, I don’t see the Committee believing a single year in the next four years that you are ever above 2 percent."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"In fact, for each year, you are below it until 2023, which is the first time that you actually hit 2 percent."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So do you think—are, are you confident—is this just the Committee is not confident that not only can it not hit its 2 percent goal, but that now it can’t hit its goal of being above 2 percent?"
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Not at all.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, you don’t—you also don’t see people, by and large, lifting off or raising interest rates above zero."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,I guess there are 4 exceptions out of a Committee of 17 during that—during the forecast period.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we don’t reach 2 percent, but we get very close to it in the forecast."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, you know, what we said again in the [Statement on] Longer-Run [Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy]—you know, in our consensus statement is that we, you know—“policy decisions reflect … the balance of risks, including risks to the financial system that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s goals.” So the test would be, you know, does a majority of the Committee feel that, that monetary policy is, is triggering that?"
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Inflation does move up over time.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, in terms of going forward, I would just say this: There are various ways and margins that we can adjust our tools going forward, and we’ll continue to monitor developments."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,That amounts to roughly $80 billion a month of Treasuries and $40 billion net per month for MBS.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,The pandemic has also left a significant imprint on inflation.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"For some goods, including food, supply constraints have led to notably higher prices, adding to the burden for those struggling with lost income."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"More broadly, however, weaker demand, especially in sectors that have been most affected by the pandemic, has held down consumer prices, and overall, inflation is running well below our 2 percent longer-run objective."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,The median inflation projection from FOMC participants rises from 1.2 percent this year to 1.7 percent next year and reaches 2 percent in 2023.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"As the economy began its recovery, COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths also rose."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,The reimposition of some social-distancing restrictions as well as more cautious behavior by many individuals have succeeded in slowing the spread of the virus.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"As we have emphasized throughout the pandemic, the outlook for the economy is extraordinarily uncertain and will depend in large part on our success in keeping the virus in check."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,The economic dislocation has upended many lives and created great uncertainty about the future.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,All of us have a role to play in our nation’s response to the pandemic.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,A full economic recovery is unlikely until people are confident that it is safe to reengage in a broad range of activities.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,The path forward will also depend on the policy actions taken across all parts of the government to provide relief and to support the recovery for as long as needed.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"The Federal Reserve’s response to this crisis has been guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people, along with our responsibilities to promote the stability of the financial system."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,We remain committed to using our full range of tools to support the economy in this challenging time.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"The changes we made in today’s policy statement reflect our strategy to achieve our dual- mandate goals by seeking to eliminate shortfalls from maximum employment and achieve inflation that averages 2 percent over time, as we articulated in our Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,We view maximum employment as a broad-based and inclusive goal and do not see a high level of employment as posing a policy concern unless accompanied by signs of unwanted increases in inflation or the emergence of other risks that could impede the attainment of our goals.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,And we believe that achieving inflation that averages 2 percent over time helps ensure that longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored at our longer-run 2 percent objective.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Following the advice of public health professionals to keep appropriate social distances and to wear masks in public will help get the economy back to full strength.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"In particular, the high level of joblessness has been especially severe for lower-wage workers in the services sector, for women, and for African Americans and Hispanics."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"The economic downturn has not fallen equally on all Americans, and those least able to shoulder the burden have been hardest hit."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Looking ahead, FOMC participants project the unemployment rate to continue to decline; the median projection is 7.6 percent at the end of this year, 5.5 percent next year, and 4 percent by 2023."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Transcript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference September 16, 2020 CHAIR POWELL."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Good afternoon.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"At the Federal Reserve, we are strongly committed to achieving the monetary policy goals that Congress has given us—maximum employment and price stability."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Since the beginning of the pandemic, we have taken forceful actions to provide some relief and stability, to ensure that the recovery will be as strong as possible, and to limit lasting damage to the economy."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Today my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee and I made some important changes to our policy statement, including an update to our guidance for the likely path of our policy interest rate."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Guided by our new Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy that we announced a few weeks ago, these changes clarify our strong commitment over a longer time horizon."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Before describing today’s policy actions, let me briefly review recent economic developments."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Economic activity has picked up from its depressed second-quarter level, when much of the economy was shut down to stem the spread of the virus."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"With the reopening of many businesses and factories and fewer people withdrawing from social interactions, household spending looks to have recovered about three-quarters of its earlier decline."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Nonetheless, spending on services that typically require people to gather closely, including travel and hospitality, is still quite weak."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"The recovery in household spending also likely owes to federal stimulus payments and expanded unemployment benefits, which provided substantial and timely support to household incomes."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Activity in the housing sector has returned to its level at the beginning of the year, and we are starting to see signs of an improvement in business investment."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"The recovery has progressed more quickly than generally expected, and forecasts from FOMC participants for economic growth this year have been revised up since our June Summary of Economic Projections."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Even so, overall activity remains well below its level before the pandemic and the path ahead remains highly uncertain."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"In the labor market, roughly half of the 22 million jobs that were lost in March and April have been regained as many people returned to work."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,The unemployment rate declined over the past four months but remains elevated at 8.4 percent as of August.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Although we welcome this progress, we will not lose sight of the millions of Americans who remain out of work."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"In turn, well-anchored inflation expectations enhance our ability to meet both our employment and inflation objectives, particularly in the new normal in which interest rates are closer to their effective lower bound even in good times."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we do—we do think that these purchases have been effective in, in restoring orderly market conditions and have supported the flow of credit to households and businesses, including by fostering more accommodative financial conditions, which, of course, we think is a good thing."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hence, as we say in our statement, with inflation running persistently below 2 percent, we “will aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time so that inflation averages 2 percent over time and longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2 percent.” We expect “to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until these outcomes”—including maximum employment—“are achieved.” With regard to interest rates, we now indicate that we expect it will be appropriate to maintain the current 0 to ¼ percent target range for the federal funds rate “until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee’s assessments of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time.” In addition, over coming months we will continue to increase our “holdings of Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities at least at the current pace.” These asset purchases are intended “to sustain smooth market functioning and help foster accommodative financial conditions, thereby supporting the flow of credit to households and businesses.” We believe the strong policy guidance we are providing today will serve the economy well by promoting our goals through the many possible paths the recovery may take."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Preserving the flow of credit is essential for mitigating the damage to the economy and promoting a robust recovery.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,I’ll now be glad to take your questions.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.

2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Good afternoon, Chair Powell."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Nick Timiraos from the Wall Street Journal.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"You’ve been very clear about the Committee’s intention on rates, not even thinking about thinking about raising rates, and today showing low rates even as unemployment falls to 4 percent and inflation rises to 2 percent."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Does the guidance today apply to the current asset purchase pace?
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Are there any macroeconomic conditions under which you would favor increasing the monthly pace of Treasury and MBS purchases?
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,And under what conditions would a decrease in the monthly pace of purchases be appropriate?
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we say in our postmeeting statement that we’ll continue to increase our securities holdings “at least at the current pace” over coming months “to sustain smooth market functioning and help foster accommodative financial conditions.” That latter part is an updating of our guidance to reflect what I’ve been saying in these press conferences for some time and what other central banks have acknowledged, which is that the purchases are fostering accommodative financial conditions as well."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,My question is about asset purchases.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,We will miss him.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"He will be remembered for his intellect, but also his kindness, his equanimity, and his dedication to achieving our mission on behalf of the American people."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,His outstanding analysis and advice have been indispensable to the FOMC and have played a key role in the policy decisions that will define this era of the Federal Reserve.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Many of our programs rely on emergency lending powers that require the support of the Treasury Department and are available only in very unusual circumstances, such as those we find ourselves in today."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"We have deployed these lending powers to an unprecedented extent, enabled, in large part, by financial backing and support from Congress and the Treasury."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"When the time comes, after the crisis has passed, we will put these emergency tools back in the toolbox."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"As I have emphasized before, these are lending powers, not spending powers."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,The Fed cannot grant money to particular beneficiaries.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,We can only create programs or facilities with broad-based eligibility to make loans to solvent entities with the expectation that the loans will be repaid.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Many borrowers are benefiting from these programs, as is the overall economy."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"But for many others, getting a loan that may be difficult to repay may not be the answer."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"In these cases, direct fiscal support may be needed."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Elected officials have the power to tax and spend and to make decisions about where we, as a society, should direct our collective resources."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"The fiscal policy actions that have been taken thus far have made a critical difference to families, businesses, and communities across the country."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Even so, the current economic downturn is the most severe in our lifetimes."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"It will take a while to get back to the levels of economic activity and employment that prevailed at the beginning of this year, and it may take continued support from both monetary and fiscal policy to achieve that."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"We understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Everything we do is in service to our public mission.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,We are committed to using our full range of tools to support the economy and to help assure that the recovery from this difficult period will be as robust as possible.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Finally, I would like to take a moment to recognize the passing of our friend and colleague, Thomas Laubach."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Of course, as we note in our policy statement, we “would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of our [the Committee’s] goals.” The Federal Reserve has also been taking broad and forceful actions to more directly support the flow of credit in the economy for households, for businesses large and small, and for state and local governments."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"We do expect that will continue today, and we expect that our, our guidance is powerful and will help that outcome."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,These programs serve as a backstop to key credit markets and appear to have restored the flow of credit from private lenders through normal channels.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,STEVE LIESMAN.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,So that’s a downside risk.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I, I think the real question is, is, when and how much and what will be the—what will be the contents?"
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, no one—no one has any certainty around that, but, broadly speaking, if we don’t get that, then there would certainly be downside risks through the— certainly through the channel I mentioned."

2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’ll also show up in things like evictions and foreclosures and, and, you know, things that will scar and damage the economy."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks for taking my question.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we—you know, we monitor everything we think is important in the U.S. economy."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And in that—in a broad sense, all of it goes into thinking about monetary policy."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,You mentioned inequality.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, you know, disparities in, in income and in financial well- being by various demographic and racial categories is something we monitor carefully."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Inequality, which I would point to—it’s a multifaceted thing."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,But I would point to the relative stagnation of incomes for people at the lower end of the income spectrum and also lower mobility.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Chairman Powell, given the recent update to the policy framework and repeated calls for this in the Fed Listens events, is the Fed open to other measures of the economy, such as income inequality and affordability of housing?"
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"But there’s, there’s certainly a risk, though, that, that those who are unemployed have saved—appear to have saved some of those benefits, and they’ll, they’ll now spend them, and that, as the months pass, if, if there’s no follow-up on that, if there isn’t additional support and there isn’t a job for the—some of those people who are, are from industries where, where it’s going to be very hard to find new work, then you’ll—that will start to show up in economic activity."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, so far the economy has proven resilient to the—to the lapsing of the—to the, of the CARES Act unemployment— enhanced unemployment benefits."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,And so I would just say that if—and it’s very hard to say.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks for taking the question.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,James Politi with the Financial Times.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Do you consider today’s enhanced forward guidance to have actual accommodation to the—to the U.S. economy from a monetary perspective and sort of deliver further support for the economy?
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Or is it just a tweak to your existing policy stance?
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, in terms of fiscal support, do you assume in your own projections—not just, you know, private forecasters—that additional fiscal support will be forthcoming?"
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Or do you expect weaker growth or a—or a larger contraction rather this year if no fiscal support is forthcoming?
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, in terms of the effects, so I think what we’ve done is—is more or less aligned with the consensus statement today."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So it’s, it’s in line with what, what might have been expected."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"As I mentioned, I think over time it will provide very powerful support for this economy as we move forward."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"In a sense, it’s consistent with expectations, so I don’t—I’m not looking for a big reaction right now."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"But I think, over time, again, guidance that we expect to retain the current stance until the economy is—has moved very far toward our goals is a strong and powerful thing."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,And I think that will be supportive of the economy over time.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"In terms of additional fiscal support, I guess your question is, what would happen if— yes, so, people have different assessments, and, and different participants in the FOMC made different assessments on their own."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think broadly, though, there is an expectation among private forecasters and among FOMC participants that there will be some further fiscal action."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,And there does seem to be an appetite on the part of all the relevant players to doing something.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"The question is, how much and when?"
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,So those are things that hold back our economy.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,JAMES POLITI.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,They are.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"We, we have interest rates and bank supervision and financial stability policy and things like that, but we can’t—we can’t get at those things through our tools."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"If you remember, early in the spring when the acute phase of the pandemic hit, market function was very low."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And it’s improved rapidly and, and in many respects is, is in a good place now."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"We also, though, think that these asset purchases, which total $120 billion a month—you know, which is much larger than, for example, the last asset purchase program during the Global Financial Crisis and the recovery therefrom—we think that that’s also providing accommodative financial conditions and supporting growth."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,And we think that’s fine.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’re also aware that we, we—there are ways we can adjust that, you know, to do various things—you know, make it smaller, make it larger, and also target different sectors of the—of the curve."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, we’re, we’re going to continue to monitor developments, and we’re prepared to adjust our plans as appropriate."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"We think, clearly, there’s been great progress, in terms of market function."

2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Hi.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks for taking my question.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,I wanted to ask about a couple of things.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And then, somewhat related, I was wondering if you could provide any more detail about the stress scenarios that you all are going to release for the big banks and whether that is going to be another full-blown stress test, whether we’re going to publicly see those results, and what it might mean for bank payouts."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,We think that—that effectively saying that policy will remain highly accommodative until the economy is very far along in its recovery should provide strong support for the economy and get us there sooner rather than later.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Victoria.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, you know, we think our—we think that our asset purchases are doing both the thing—both those things today."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"At what point do you think it’s prudent to shift the bond purchases from market stability—as you had said, from the shorter-term maturities to more longer-term, more stimulus-related?"
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"When we lower the federal funds rate, that supports the economy across a broad range of, of people and activities, but we can’t—we don’t have the ability to target particular groups."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Notwithstanding that, we, we do talk about it, because these are important features of our economy."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we—you know, I, I think those are—those distributional issues are, are issues that are really for our elected officials."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I would say, I take them seriously as holding back our economy."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"The productive capacity of the economy is limited when not everyone has the opportunity, has the educational background and, and the health care and all the things that you need to be an active participant in our workforce."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I think we can—if we want to have the, the highest potential output and the—and the best output for our economy, we need that prosperity to be very broadly spread in the longer run."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I—again, I would just say, the Fed—you know, we can talk about those things a lot."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And in, in—when we think about maximum employment in particular, we do look at individual groups."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So high unemployment in a particular racial group like African Americans when—you know, we would look at that as we think about whether we’re really at maximum employment."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,We would look—we would look at that along with a lot of other data.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So the answer is, we do look at all those things and, and do what we can with our tools."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, ultimately, these are issues for elected representatives."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Edward Lawrence.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Yes, thank you, Chairman Powell, for the question."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,I just wanted some clarity here.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"The thing is, we don’t really have the tools to address those."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,James Politi.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,EDWARD LAWRENCE.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Of course, the details of that are for Congress, not for the Fed."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"But I would just say, there are still roughly 11 million people still out of work due to the pandemic, and a good part of those people were working in industries that are likely to struggle."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Those people may need additional, additional support as they try to find their way through what will be a difficult time for them."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’ve also got struggling small businesses, especially those in the business of facing directly to the public."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we have state and local governments dealing with a drop in revenue at the same time spending has gone up, much of it related to the pandemic and economic effects."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, again, I would say, the fiscal support has been essential in, in the good progress we see now."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, finally, I’ll note that just about all—the overwhelming majority of, of private forecasters who, who project an ongoing recovery are assuming there will be substantial additional fiscal support."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"That said, my sense is that more fiscal support is likely to be needed."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Mike Derby.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHAEL DERBY.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,[Inaudible] taking my question.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Should we expect any further evolutions in forward guidance, say, maybe an adoption of something akin to the Evans rule that we had a few years ago?"
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Or is there something else that the Fed might be considering in the future?
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Well, so we think that the forward guidance we adopted today is appropriate and, as I mentioned, powerful."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,So there’s been a really positive effect.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we’re seeing the results of that in—today in income and household spending data, in the labor market data, in the construction data, in the data for business equipment spending, and the fact that businesses are staying in business, and, you know, the pace of default and things like that has really slowed."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,It was forceful and pretty effective.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.

2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Chair Powell."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks very much for taking my question.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"I wanted to ask if you anticipate a slowing in the pace of the recovery if there is not another stimulus package and, specifically, if there are particular holes still remaining in the economy that you think could be helped by more aid from Congress."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks very much.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Sure.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"We do expect that that pace will slow just because you would expect that the, the pace would be fastest right at the beginning of the—right at the beginning of the recovery, because you had such a sharp decline."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"You would expect that the third quarter should be the fastest gains, and that, after that, the pace should slow down to a more normal pace."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,So we do expect that.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,In terms of fiscal policy—you asked about fiscal policy.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, you know, one thing—I guess I would start by saying that the initial response from fiscal authorities was rapid."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Effectively, what it says is that we’ll, we will keep policy where it is now—keep the rate policy where it is now until unemployment reaches the Committee’s assessments or levels that are—sorry, not unemployment, labor market conditions reach levels that are consistent with the Committee’s assessments of maximum employment, until inflation reaches 2 percent, and until it’s on track to go above 2 percent moderately for some time."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So that’s very strong forward guidance, and we think that that will be durable guidance that will provide significant support to the economy in coming years."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, first, if you look at the Summary of Economic Projections that my colleagues and I filed for this meeting, what you’ll see is an expectation that the recovery will continue—that it will continue at a reasonable pace through 2021, ’22, and ’23."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And the idea that we would look for the, the quickest way out is just—it’s just not who we are."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s not that—there’s no message of that here.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,We would not be looking for one month of 2 percent inflation; we said return to 2—to achieve 2 percent inflation.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Okay.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So just understand that, you know, we’re strongly committed to achieving our goals and the overshoot."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,So that should tell you about that.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Oh, in terms of—okay, in terms of—so, what does “moderate” mean?"
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,It means not large.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,It doesn’t—it means not very high above 2 percent.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,I think that’s a fairly well-understood word.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"In terms of—in terms of “for a time,” what it means is not permanently and not for a sustained period."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, we’re, we’re resisting the urge to try to create some sort of a rule or a formula here."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I think the, the public will understand pretty well what we want."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s actually pretty straightforward.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So that’s, that’s really our thinking on, on forward guidance on rates."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And if we do that, inflation expectations will be right at 2 percent, and that’ll help us achieve 2 percent inflation over time and avoid the situation where the central bank loses its ability to support the economy."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,We want to achieve inflation that averages 2 percent over time.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"In terms of inflation, you know, this is a Committee that is both confident and committed to—and determined to reach our goals."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’re looking at a judgmental assessment, which I think we’ll be very transparent about as we—as we go forward."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,It means moderate.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So that would certainly mean low unemployment, it would mean high labor force participation, it would mean wages—it would be a whole range of things."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Howard Schneider.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,And we’re not looking at a rule.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,HOWARD SCHNEIDER.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thanks, Chair Powell, for doing this."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Each of these have modifiers, and I wonder if you could explain them a little bit more."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,How do we pin down assessments of maximum employment?
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"When you say that “inflation has risen to 2 percent,” does that mean 2 percent for a day, a month, six months?"
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So to follow up on Mike’s question there, since you described this guidance as durable, you—you’ve set up a three-part test here for rate hikes: levels consistent with assessments of maximum employment, inflation has risen to 2 percent, and you’re on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,And how should we define “for some time”?
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So it’s broader labor conditions, consistent with our Committee’s assessment of maximum employment."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, as you know, maximum employment is not—is not something that can be reduced to a number the way inflation can."
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s a broad range of factors.
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And when you say “on track to moderately exceed,” how should we define “moderately”?"
2020-09-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"It really always has been and, really, a substantial number of factors that we’ve indicated we would look at."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"And then, more broadly, on the state of the economy, are you comfortable now that the tail risk for worst-case outcomes has been kind of swept aside and minimized at this point?"
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"Clearly, you know, therapeutics are advancing, research on vaccines are advancing, death rates are way down, hospitalization rates are, are lower now, but—so we’re learning."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, I mean, we, we are so— we’re very far from saying that we think we’ve got this and eliminated the tail risks."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"But I think, clearly, the tail risks have, have diminished since—at least our perception of them has diminished since earlier in the year."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"Scott Horsley, NPR."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,It hasn’t gone away.
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,SCOTT HORSLEY.
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"Earlier this summer, I know that you formed a task force to look at the distribution of coins around the System."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,So I think we have to be humble about where we are relative to this—to this disease.
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"In terms of the tail risks, I mean, I think clearly the tail risks that we were worried about have, have subsided."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"I would not say that anybody’s feeling comfortable about this, though."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"We, we ask, “How do you make policy in light of the risks?” and often it’s downside risks in a situation like this."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,We don’t just look at the most likely case.
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"But we, we have to—we do make policy from a risk-management standpoint."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"And that—you know, that’s, that’s—what is to be expected of us is, is to think about how things can go wrong as well as the way things that can go right."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, we were worried about very negative potential outcomes."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s all I have for you on that today.
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"And that’s, that’s really all I can say today."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"We, we are just getting started on it, and, and it’s a decision that we’ll make jointly with the Treasury Department."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, on your first question, we, we really are just turning to this issue now, and we have not made any decisions."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,I wonder if you can give us an update on how that’s going.
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"Are we down, in other words, to kind of household-level problems among a large set of households, perhaps, but that the financial crisis, double-dip recession sort of scenarios are, are off the table?"
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, we’ve gotten through the first five, six months of the—of the expansion better than expected, but we do see in Europe—look what’s happening in Europe, look what’s happening here—another spike in cases as the cold weather arrives and people are inside more."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"I know there’s been some, some public relations effort."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks.
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,Has that—has that problem subsided?
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I, I’ll just leave it at that."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,Not at all.
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"Quick follow-up from Gina’s question: Have you gotten a commitment from Secretary Mnuchin to extend the 13(3) facilities if you decide it’s necessary, and are you concerned what a lame-duck Trump Administration might do in that regard?"
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"And the election comes up in some—you know, it comes up now and again, but it is not at all a central focus of the meeting."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,We talk about what the right policy response might be.
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,We talk about risks to the outlook.
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,We hear reports on how households and businesses are doing.
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"I would say, you know, the meeting we just finished, for example, what we do is we talk about the economy and markets, domestically and around the world."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, the—you ask if we had discussions."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,Every day we’ll continue to serve the American people using our tools to support the economy during this difficult time.
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, at the Fed here, we will, as always, continue to do our jobs."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I’m very reluctant, as you will imagine, to comment on the election directly, indirectly, at all, other than just to say that it’s a good time to take a step back and let the institutions of our democracy do their jobs."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"And has the Fed had any discussions, either internally or with the Treasury Department, about responding to that, should it happen?"
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,Are you concerned that perhaps tensions or uncertainty over the outcome of the presidential election could pose a risk to the economic outlook or trigger market turmoil?
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,We still don’t know who the winner is.
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,We’ve just had a presidential election here in the United States.

2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,So very pleased to report that.
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we worked very hard to increase the supply of coins and, even more than that, the distribution of coins around the System and are happy to say that that situation is well on the way to normalizing itself."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I actually just—I just caught up this morning with the—with the person who heads that operation here who, who says that, yes, things have really gotten significantly better on the coin front."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"And so it’s a really incredibly important part of the payment system, and we do pay a lot of attention to it."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"So let me say why it’s such an important—you know, in a world where so many payments are made digitally and all that, coins and currency are very important for the relatively low-income people."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,I think October was “Get the Coins Moving” month.
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,HOWARD SCHNEIDER.
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,EDWARD LAWRENCE.
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,So I don’t really have a specific hypothetical I would—I would put to you.
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"And as a second point onto that, you know, would—if there’s no fiscal stimulus package, would that then trigger buying of more long-term assets or change the asset purchases?"
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,So what would cause the Federal Reserve to shift more of its asset purchases towards the long-term securities and Treasuries and change the amount of spending there also?
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for taking the question."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"Edward Lawrence, Fox Business."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,DAVID GURA.
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, sure, I think there are plenty of people on Capitol Hill who, on both sides of the aisle, on both sides of the Hill, who see a need for further fiscal action and understand perfectly why that might be the case."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I, I don’t—I think—you know, I, I don’t want to say whether I feel like I’m being heard or not."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"I would just say that we, we understand that there are a number of parameters that we have where we can shift the composition, the duration, you know, the size, the life, life cycle of the program."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"I just know from, from the experience of the last cycle, it helps to have the whole government working on these things, and this one is particularly that way."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"So let me—let me say, in the first instance, our, our main focus is on doing our job, and that is really what we’re, we’re focused on is using the tools that Congress has given us and the assignment they’ve given us."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"As you look at the prospects for this economy and potential need for more fiscal policy, do you feel like those who are crafting that policy, or could be, are listening to you and have a firm grasp of what you’re saying about how that might affect or improve the economy going forward?"
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think in your recent comments and in Governor Brainard’s comments, certainly, there’s been more passion yet about the need for Congress to do more—I know that you’re limited in what you can say or the degree to which you’d want to advise Congress, but a simple question: Do you feel that you’re being heard?"
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,You talked about the balance between monetary and fiscal policy.
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’ve listened to your rhetoric over the course of this pandemic, and you talked about what the Fed was doing, the reasons for doing it at first."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"Can I ask a quick follow-up, just about the passions of the Fed Chairman?"
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,DAVID GURA.
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"In any case, it’s a risk, is what I would characterize it—I would characterize it as a risk, as I did in my—in my comments."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,This one seems to be larger and more widespread.
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"Again, very reluctant to get into anything more than that."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"We thought the same thing, in fairness, about the wave we had this summer in the South and the West."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I think we’re, we’re—that is the thing that we think about night and day."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"All of those things are, are available to us as ways to deliver addition—you know, more accommodation if we think that’s appropriate."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"Right now, we, we like the amount of accommodation the program is, is delivering."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,And it will just depend on the—on the facts and circumstances.
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, we take it as our obligation to—you know, to understand these risks and incorporate them into our— into the way we supervise and, and think about the, the overall financial system and the economy."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, of course, the longer term does arrive over time."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,These tend to be longer-term risks.
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"You hear—you know, there’s lots of research going on at the various Reserve Banks and here at the Board in trying to understand this."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,So we’re very much working with and monitoring the things other central banks are doing.
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’re in the working groups, and we’re doing all of that."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, we haven’t, we hadn’t actually formally joined, but we’re there."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’re active participants, as you know, in the CG—no, the greening the financial system."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,And we’re watching what other—what other countries are doing.
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we are, you know, very actively, in the early stages of this, getting up to speed, working with our central bank colleagues and other colleagues around the world to try to think about how this can be part of our framework."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s a relatively—the science and art of incorporating climate change into our thinking about financial regulation is relatively new, as you know."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"Climate change is, is one of those risks."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I, I do think that the public, public will expect and has every right to expect that we—that in our oversight of the financial system, we will account for all material risks and try to protect the economy and the public from those risks."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,Yes.
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"What are you all thinking of doing on that front beyond what you’re already doing, and do you have any plans for joining the network for greening the financial system?"
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"FHFA Director Mark Calabria recently said that financial regulators need to account for financial change—climate change, I’m sorry."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,I wanted to ask about climate change.
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks for taking the question.
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Chair Powell."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,VICTORIA GUIDA.
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,Victoria Guida.
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"Today’s meeting was about analyzing the—one of the things it was about was about analyzing the various ways and having a, you know, good discussion about how to think about those, those various parameters, which I, I thought was quite a useful discussion."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,We may reach a view at some point that we need to do more on that front.
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"Howard Schneider, Reuters."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks.
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,How closely are you willing to work with Treasury?
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,There—they have to be responsible to the electorate.
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"The—you know, the job of taxation and spending goes to people who have stood for election and been elected, and that’s the way it should be."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,That separation between those jobs is absolutely critical in our system of government.
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,We have different jobs.
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"No, that’s not something we do."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"So that— what I mean by that is, is really, you know, the, the central bank is really funding fiscal activities of the government fairly directly."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"And so if the idea is money-financed fiscal policy, that’s not something that we would consider."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, so I’m going to take your question literally."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,Is there any circumstance under which you would consider those or those would be justified?
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,Another is perhaps following the BOE in increasing asset purchases to support additional fiscal programs or spending by the Treasury.
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,One of the suggestions is buying state and municipal securities directly.
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"We have a specific, you know, job to do with, with a specific set of tools to support maximum employment, stable prices, financial stability, help the payment system, supervise banks—all the things we’re assigned to do."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"Mr. Chairman, there’s a small but growing number of people, including some former Fed economists, who say you should find ways to go beyond your mandate to provide additional support to the economy, which, in essence, would be fiscal support, since it hasn’t come from Congress."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"Last question to Michael McKee, Bloomberg."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"But I—you know, I think we, we are reaching many of them now, and, and I hope that the new changes will help us reach more."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, so I—we put, we put an awful lot into Main Street, and it is very challenging to reach a lot of those companies."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,They don’t want to run up their debt.
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, and the reason is that, you know, activity’s at a relatively low level."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,Companies are not borrowing.
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, what you hear out there is that demand—you talk to banks, and they’ll say demand for loans is very, very low right now."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"I do think, you know, the grant programs, the PPP, were, were a great way to reach smaller companies."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"Reaching out to small and medium-sized businesses through the banking system, which we had to do, is, is quite challenging."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,The—Main Street is just—is just a bigger challenge than all of them.
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHAEL MCKEE.
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"But we, we, we’re not going to get into financing the government and, and—by the way, when we buy government bonds, we don’t—it doesn’t actually, as you probably know, doesn’t change the amount of government debt outstanding."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"We issue a reserve to, to purchase a Treasury security, and that’s just another form—on the consolidated balance sheet of the federal government, that’s just another obligation."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"You change the—you change the, you know, the nature of the obligation, but not the total quantity of debt that the government has when you do these asset purchase programs."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,One would expect that it would.
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you very much.
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’re there to provide emergency liquidity when intermediation has broken down and then to pull back on that when— you know, when—as the markets normalize, we pull back and we put those tools away, as we did after the Global Financial Crisis and as we will here when the time comes."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s not what we do.
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,That would be more along the lines of a GSE.
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’re not—that shouldn’t be a permanent thing where we’re just another federal financing agency that’s available to direct credit to—you know, to very worthy borrowers."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,So that’s what 13(3) is for.
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"But just the fact that we’re there as a backstop seems to—seems to get the private parties to get back together and, and get the market working again."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"We did—we’ve done a very small number of, of loans."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"The amount of financing that’s happened in the municipal markets this year is much higher than it was the prior year, and, and we didn’t do it."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,So we only actually have to do a backstop.
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"What turns out to happen is, we announce a program, and the market starts working."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we step in under 13(3), and we provide liquidity."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s no longer working.
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"But I, I see—what that is, from our standpoint, is a rare thing that we do under section 13(3) when regular intermediation in the capital markets or in the banking system has broken down."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we’re, we’re actually doing that now."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we’re doing that now as part of an emergency facility under section 13(3), you know, which has to meet the emergency requirements of exigent circumstances and which is all clearly laid out in the law."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,We’re buying municipal securities of up to three years.
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"Well, we’re doing that with the Municipal Liquidity Facility now, so we’re, we’re buying, you know, with, with our own funds and with the CARES Act funds that, that we’ve gotten through Congress and the Treasury."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"If I could follow up, there is a suggestion that you buy state and municipal securities directly in the same way that you buy mortgage-backed securities, providing, then, cash to municipalities that are cash-strapped at this point."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHAEL MCKEE.
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, you know, to—again, to take your question literally about financing fiscal activity, it’s really not something that we think the central bank should do and, and not something we’re looking at."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,So I don’t know exactly what you’re referring to.
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think the other—certainly the, the funding market programs have been a big success."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,I think that’s also been a success.
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think the success—I think the state and local government program has also restored market function so that—whereas, you know, there were the, the sort of individual investors who wind up funding loans in the muni market through."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,And we’ve been willing to make changes.
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"Then you get it started, and you make changes."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"And you, you just try to get it out there and get it working and not try to do everything before you start it because you’ll never start it if you do that."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,We tend to—it’s—there’s more work than one might—certainly than I imagined in setting up one of these facilities.
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, with, with these programs, why did it—why didn’t we do it right away?"
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,And we’ll see how much demand will come.
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"We want, you know, qualifying businesses to be able to borrow."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,We try to be responsive.
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"And it—basically, we concluded we could just change the fee structure to create incentives for that, so we did that."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I went back to the office and thought, you know, okay, so what would that look like if we were to redesign the program in a way—what’s the least thing we could do to redesign the program so that we could move to a lower level?"
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I, I got the question in a—in an oversight hearing a month or so ago with the Secretary and said that."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"So—and, you know, we’ve been saying we’d have to redesign the program."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s the most recent set of ones that we’ve done.
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"But we heard, over and over again, that it would be great if we could reduce it to $100,000."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,And so we were reluctant.
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we’re relying on them, to some extent, for, for doing that."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"They keep 5 percent, so they actually have to underwrite the credit."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"And there’s a certain amount of work that they have to do to get—to get into the loan program and do—and to document the thing, the loans that they make because these are loans that, you know, go on their balance sheet."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"And part of that just is that the fee structure is what it is, and that’s the compensation that the banks get."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, we have had very little demand below $1 million in loans."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,Sure.
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"Chairman Powell, can you tell us a little bit more about why the minimum loan size under the Main Street facility was reduced last week and why that was done now rather than earlier, seeing that small businesses are still— clearly still—struggling to make the change necessary?"
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you for taking my question.
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,ANNEKEN TAPPE.
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"Anneken, CNN."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"We moved the minimum down to $250,000, and we were reluctant to go below that."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, again, we hope—we hope that it will help some companies, and I guess we’ll find out."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"I would say that the, you know, the corporate—the larger corporate market-based lending program has been very successful without making a single loan—I think, unambiguously, has been a big success."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,There’s a bunch of programs.
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,Yes.
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"When you say the programs are effective, do you not think there’s more that can be done with another type of program or another redesign either for small businesses or for assisting state and local governments?"
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,But that has only reached 400—there’s only been 400 loans.
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mean, you spoke [inaudible] about the small business lending program."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,If I could just follow up on that quickly.
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,HEATHER SCOTT.
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"So it really is, if you—if you want to get the economy back as quickly as possible to where we want it to be, then, then really it should be all of government working together."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, remember, we’ve always said this will take a whole of government approach, including health-care policy and fiscal policy too."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I do think there, there are things that we can do."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, certainly, the facilities have been doing a lot of work and been very successful, I think, overall in accomplishing that job."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,Who knows?
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"If—you know, if things deteriorate, that would be the case where you’d want to maybe continue the facilities and, and, and maybe change them and maybe have new ones."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"We could, you know, if, if the facilities are extended, we could certainly look at new facilities."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"Right now, we like the job it’s doing."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"As I mentioned, the asset purchase program—there’s a number of dimensions in which we can adjust that if we deem it to be appropriate."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"So when I say we’re not out of ammo, I’m looking at, you know, a couple of our tools, mainly."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,Would you consider some sort of credit program for state and local businesses—state and local governments that are facing real budgetary pressures?
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I’m wondering, then, what is the next tool you expect to be able to roll out?"
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,You say that you’re—that you’re not out of ammo.
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you, Chair Powell, for taking the question."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"Heather Scott this time, right?"
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,HEATHER SCOTT.
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,Heather.
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"through mutual funds, they, they had withdrawn a lot of money, and, and that—we’ve had many weeks of consecutive, I believe, of, of inflows there, and you’re largely back to a normal functioning market."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"That, that could weigh on economic activity."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"And the economy, you know, seemed to move right through that."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"And even if we don’t have—and I don’t expect that we would—sort of government-imposed restrictions, it does seem likely, though, that people who have maybe begun to engage in activities that they had in flying, staying in a hotel, going to restaurants, going to bars, and, and things like that, that they may pull back in a situation where suddenly the cases are everywhere in your city, your state, your community."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,Another would be claims.
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"That’s the case for, for all different measures in the labor force—in the labor market, rather."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"And they’re certainly still very large, but they’ve—but the pace of improvement has moderated."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I think if you look at just about anything, you know, for example, the payroll readings, the payroll job gains in May and June were just outsized."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"And so as I think would have been expected and was expected, the pace of improvement from May and June has now moderated, so it’s not unexpected."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"Then the pandemic hit, and we had a record decline in activity in March and April, and then we had a record bounceback in May and June."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"In February, we had an economy that was performing well."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,Let’s start with February.
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, of course."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,Sure.
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,Just about all the data were—showed a big bounceback.
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"I’m wondering if you can speak specifically about what indicators you’re seeing that suggest the pace of improvement has moderated, including in the labor market, and how correlated those indicators are to the recent rise in COVID cases that we’ve seen going into flu season."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s Rachel Siegel from the Washington Post.
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Chair Powell."

2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,Rachel.
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,I look forward to your questions.
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,We are committed to using our full range of tools to support the economy and to help assure that the recovery from this difficult period will be as robust as possible.
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,Everything we do is in service to our public mission.
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"To conclude, we understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"These changes to the SEP will provide a timely perspective on the risks and uncertainties that surround the modal or baseline projections, thereby highlighting some of the risk-management considerations that are relevant for monetary policy."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"Second, we will add two new graphs that show how the balance of participants’ assessments of uncertainty and risks have evolved over time."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks very much for taking my question.
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"But then, as you would expect, when, when you sort of had people—a lot of people go back to work at once, the pace will moderate."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,Same thing with economic activity.
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"Most forecasts call for, you know, still a significant growth in the fourth quarter but not at the 33 percent annualized pace that we had in the third quarter."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,And I’ve said it on a couple of occasions that that will go better and move more quickly if we have a broad set of policies from across the government.
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s what we will do.
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"So on your first question, you know, we’ll take into account all external factors and, and do what we think we need to do with the tools that we have to pursue our goals."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"Two questions: Would the lack of fiscal support compel the Fed to provide additional accommodation, and are you and your colleagues being more vocal about the need for fiscal support because the capacity for monetary policy to support growth is diminished here, given the low level of short- and long-term rates?"
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"To follow on Marty’s question, you really have been saying since April that more is needed on the fiscal policy front, and yet we don’t seem to be that much closer than we were in the spring or the summer to additional spending."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,Nick Timiraos at the Wall Street Journal.
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thanks, Chair Powell."

2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"But I, you know, I think it’s appropriate for us not to try to prescribe for Congress exactly what they should do or what the timing of it should be or what the size of it should be and leave it at that."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"One is the further spread of the virus, and the other is the lapsing of the CARES Act benefits and the savings on people’s balance sheets that will dwindle."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"I just mentioned the two risks that I think we, we face, and those would be well addressed through more fiscal policy."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,And I do think it’s likely that further support is likely to be needed for monetary policy and fiscal policy.
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"So it is—obviously, it’s for Congress to decide the timing, size, and components of further fiscal support for the economy, and I will say that the support provided by the CARES Act was absolutely essential in supporting the recovery that we’ve seen so far, which has generally exceeded expectations."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"Could you talk a little bit about where you think the stimulus package that is being debated in Congress is and how severe a threat that could be to the economy if it does not get passed, say, before January?"
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.

2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"But what we see up to the present, really, is, continued growth, continued expansion, but at, at a gradually moderating pace."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"We have been concerned that the downside risks, though, are, are prevalent now, which are—which are really the risk of the further spread of the disease and also the risk that, that households will run through the savings they’ve managed to accumulate on their balance sheet and that that could weigh on activity."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, in a sense, that would be—that would be as expected."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"This step will make more information available at the time of our policy announcements, including the distributions of forecasts and how participants judge the uncertainty and risks that attend their projections."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we’ve said this in the very beginning: It’s really, first and foremost, health-care policy, getting the—getting the spread of the virus under control and working on therapeutics and vaccines and that kind of thing, getting—so that—those are absolutely critical to the economy."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"Previously, some of these materials were released three weeks after the meeting as part of the minutes."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,I’d like to mention a couple of changes that we plan on making to our Summary of Economic Projections beginning in December.
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"Overall, on a 12-month basis, inflation remains below our 2 percent longer-run objective."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"However, for those sectors that have been most affected by the pandemic, prices remain particularly soft."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"Following large declines in the spring, consumer prices picked up over the summer, in part reflecting a rise in durable goods prices."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,The pandemic has also left a significant imprint on inflation.
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,The economic dislocation has upended many lives and created great uncertainty about the future.
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"In particular, the high level of joblessness has been especially severe for lower-wage workers in the services sector, for women, and for African Americans and Hispanics."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"The economic downturn has not fallen equally on all Americans, and those least able to shoulder the burden have been hardest hit."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"Although we welcome this progress, we will not lose sight of the millions of Americans who remain out of work."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,The unemployment rate declined over the past five months but remained elevated at 7.9 percent as of September.
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"As with overall economic activity, the pace of improvement in the labor market has moderated."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"In the labor market, roughly half of the 22 million jobs that were lost in March and April have been regained, as many people were able to return to work."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"Even so, overall economic activity remains well below its level before the pandemic, and the path ahead remains highly uncertain."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"As we have emphasized throughout the pandemic, the outlook for the economy is extraordinarily uncertain and will depend in large part on the success of efforts to keep the virus in check."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,Business investment has also picked up.
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"The overall rebound in household spending owes, in part, to federal stimulus payments and expanded unemployment benefits, which provided essential support to many families and individuals."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"In contrast, spending on services remains low, largely due to ongoing weakness in sectors that typically require people to gather closely, including travel and hospitality."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"Household spending on goods, especially durable goods, has been strong and has moved above its pre-pandemic level."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"In recent months, however, the pace of improvement has moderated."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"The reopening of the economy led to a rapid rebound in activity, and real GDP rose at an annual rate of 33 percent in the third quarter."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,Economic activity has continued to recover from its depressed second-quarter level.
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,Today my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee and I reaffirmed our commitment to support the economy in this challenging time.
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"Since the beginning of the pandemic, we have taken forceful actions to provide relief and stability, to ensure that the recovery will be as strong as possible, and to limit lasting damage to the economy."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"At the Federal Reserve, we are strongly committed to achieving the monetary policy goals that Congress has given us—maximum employment and price stability."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,Good afternoon.
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"Transcript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference November 5, 2020 CHAIR POWELL."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I do think that that’s a risk that we have as we go into the fall now and, and the cases spike."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"The housing sector has fully recovered from the downturn, supported in part by low mortgage interest rates."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"The recent rise in new COVID-19 cases, both here in the United States and abroad, is particularly concerning."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,All of us have a role to play in our nation’s response to the pandemic.
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,Following the advice of public health professionals to keep appropriate social distances and to wear masks in public will help get the economy back to full strength.
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"It will take a while to get back to the levels of economic activity and employment that prevailed at the beginning of this year, and it may take continued support from both monetary and fiscal policy to achieve that."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"Even so, the current economic downturn is the most severe in our lifetimes."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"The fiscal policy actions that have been taken thus far have made a critical difference to families, businesses, and communities across the country."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"Elected officials have the power to tax and spend and to make decisions about where we, as a society, should direct our collective resources."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"In these cases, direct fiscal support may be needed."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"But for many others, getting a loan that may be difficult to repay may not be the answer."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"Many borrowers are benefiting from these programs, as is the overall economy."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,We can only create programs or facilities with broad-based eligibility to make loans to solvent entities with the expectation that the loans will be repaid.
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,The Fed cannot grant money to particular beneficiaries.
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"As I have emphasized before, these are lending powers, not spending powers."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"When the time comes, after the crisis has passed, we will put these emergency tools back in the toolbox."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"We have deployed these lending powers to an unprecedented extent, enabled in large part by financial backing and support from Congress and the Treasury."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,These programs serve as a backstop to key credit markets and have helped to restore the flow of credit from private lenders through normal channels.
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"Many of our programs rely on emergency lending powers that require the support of the Treasury Department and are available only in very unusual circumstances, such as those we find ourselves in today."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,Preserving the flow of credit is essential for mitigating damage to the economy and promoting a robust recovery.
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"The Federal Reserve has also been taking broad and forceful actions to more directly support the flow of credit in the economy for households, for businesses large and small, and for state and local governments."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"Looking ahead, we will continue to monitor developments and assess how our ongoing asset purchases can best support our maximum- employment and price-stability objectives as well as market functioning and financial stability."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"We believe these purchases, along with the very large purchases made to preserve financial stability in the depths of the crisis, have materially eased financial conditions and are providing substantial support to the economy."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"At this meeting, my colleagues and I discussed our asset purchases and the role they are playing in supporting the recovery."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"These asset purchases are intended to sustain smooth market functioning and help foster accommodative financial conditions, thereby supporting the flow of credit to households and businesses."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"In addition, over coming months we will continue to increase our holdings of Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities at least at the current pace."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"With regard to interest rates, we continue to expect that it will be appropriate to maintain the current 0 to ¼ percent target range for the federal funds rate until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee’s assessments of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,We expect to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until these employment and inflation outcomes are achieved.
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"As we said in September and again today, with inflation running persistently below 2 percent, we will aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time so that inflation averages 2 percent over time and longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2 percent."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"As noted in our Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, we view maximum employment as a “broad-based and inclusive goal.” Our ability to achieve maximum employment in the years ahead depends importantly on having longer-term inflation expectations well anchored at 2 percent."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"The Federal Reserve’s response to this crisis has been guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people, along with our responsibilities to promote the stability of the financial system."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,A full economic recovery is unlikely until people are confident that it’s safe to reengage in a broad range of activities.
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"First, we will release the entire package of SEP materials at the same time that the FOMC statement comes out."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"Now, those are important, as well as health policies."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"At the current pace, our holdings of securities are rising at a substantial rate of $120 billion per month—$80 billion per month of Treasuries and $40 billion per month of agency MBS."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"Fiscal policy can do what we can’t, which is to replace lost incomes for people who are out of work through no fault of their own."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,DAVID GURA.
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,David Gura.
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"And in terms of the process, this is a decision that, of course, we have to make and will make jointly with the Treasury Department."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"Right now we’re just in the process of turning to that question and, of course, not made any decisions."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, we’ve had a lot of things to work our way through."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"In terms of the extension, we are, we are just now turning to that question."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, overall, we think that the, the programs have, have gone well."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, first, let me say, we do think that the facilities have, have generally served their purposes well, particularly in supporting the flow of credit, particularly acting as backstops to private markets."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"Yes, thanks."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"[Inaudible] IMF Chief Economist Gita Gopinath wrote—Gita Gopinath wrote a piece this week in which she said, unequivocally, we’re in a global liquidity trap and talked about the limits of monetary policy right now."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,[Inaudible] —look like and whether you anticipate any consequences if they are not extended?
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s, it’s very important that—you know, there is a real threat here of those things, and, and, you know, we’re trying to do everything we can to minimize that threat."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, and those are—that’s again—that goes to keeping this episode as short as it can be and avoiding unnecessary business bankruptcies, unnecessary household bankruptcies, and unnecessary long- term stays of unemployment or supporting people through them so that they can maintain their financial footing and their lives and be able to go back to work in a productive way."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, we’ll, we’ll try to continue to do that."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,I think we have been vocal.
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"And the third was to avoid longer-run damage to the economy, and that’s, that’s all of these things."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,The second—then the second part was to provide support when—to the expansion when it came.
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"The first, at the beginning, it was to provide relief and comfort."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s sort of the third thing that we talk about.
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, you know, that’s the supply-side damage."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, and there are parts of the economy where it’s going to be hard until there’s a vaccine—you know, the parts of the economy."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, we’re, we’re sort of halfway there on the labor market recovery at best."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,[Inaudible] JEANNA SMIALEK.
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"She said, “Fiscal policy will need to be the main game in town.” And it’s been a busy week."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"I don’t know if you were able to pick up the pink paper and read that piece, but she does say 97 percent of advanced economies have rates below 1 percent."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I just wonder if you’d agree with her, in principle, that we are in a global liquidity trap, and what the consequences of that would be."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"We have a widespread spike in cases across the country, more in some regions than others."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"They’re, they’re going to be critical to the economy."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, as I mentioned in my—in my opening remarks, it’s a concern."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,Yes.
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"I didn’t see Madame Lagarde’s comments this morning, but I, I took the sense of that question to be the spread of the disease in Europe, and what do we think about that?"
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, of course, you need health-care policy too."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, stimulating aggregate demand is one thing, but where there’s a part of the economy that kind of will be resistant to that, you also need fiscal policy."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,So I do think fiscal policy is absolutely essential here.
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,And it’s certainly one of the main reasons why the recovery has been as good as it’s been so far.
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"And the fiscal response was, was frankly, I think, very good and very robust in the United States."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s a sudden shock where tens of millions of people are out of work.
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s not so much a typical recession where demand weakens, the Fed cuts interest rates, interest rates stimulate demand, and the economy recovers."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"I’ve said—we’ve said from the very beginning, though, that this is particular—that the particular situation we find ourselves in is one where there is a sudden loss of income on, on the part of millions and tens of millions of people."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,And we’re going to—we’re going to keep at that.
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I also think, if you look at the stock of assets that we’ve bought, if you look at the facilities and, and the way we’ve been able to keep accommodative financial— financial conditions accommodative, I think we’ve been able to do a lot of things that are providing very strong support for the economy."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,I do think there’s more that can be done.
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we do not doubt the power of the things that we’ve already done or the things that we may, may do in the future."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think—I think that we are strongly committed to using these powerful tools that we have to support the economy during this difficult time for as long as needed, and no one should have any doubt about that."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"And the answer to that would be “no,” I don’t think that."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"First, I, I take the sense of your first question to be, is monetary policy out of power or out of ammo?"
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"Okay, thanks."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"As you lent an ear to what she had to say the dire warnings that she was making this morning as she looks at the situation that Europe’s i,n , what can you and your colleagues learn about the second wave or the third wave that you’ve talked about and, and we’ve all feared when it comes to a, a policy response?"
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,And I wanted to ask you about how you look at [inaudible] Christine Lagarde laying out what the ECB plans to do.
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"You’re, you’re looking [inaudible]."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"My second question is, you talk about how you follow the epidemiology."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’ve talked a lot about fiscal policy here domestically, and she talks about the need for sort of a global cohesive approach to, to fiscal policy."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,We are a long way from our goals.
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"Now, that’s so far."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,So two questions.
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,I don’t know how we could be much more vocal about it than we have been.
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, nonetheless, we have a habit of keeping things in place for a while."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"We, we don’t expect that things will deteriorate."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, we don’t—we don’t take anything for granted."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, by the way, they’re sustaining the gains we’ve made in financial stability."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"So in terms of what they can do, first I would just say, the purchases that we have in place are providing strong support to economic activity still."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, so we haven’t looked at reducing purchases."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,And that need hasn’t dwindled at all.
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"But after that period, we’ve, we’ve understood all along that our purchases are also supporting economic activity, and that’s important."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"So—and that’s really been true—I think in the very beginning of the crisis, the main focus was, obviously, financial, financial market function, particularly in, in, you know, some of the major markets."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, on the first—the first question, it’s—our asset purchases are serving both purchases, both—sorry, both purposes: financial market function and support for economic activity."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.

2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"The second question I have is, what good, for the broader economy, would additional QE do at this point, given that interest rates are already low and don’t seem to be rising even above 1 percent?"
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"The first is, if the market is functioning better, as you and other Fed officials have said, and QE right now is designed for smooth market functioning, why haven’t you reduced QE that you’re doing if the market is functioning better already?"
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"Mr. Chairman, also to follow up on sort of what Nick was talking about, two questions about quantitative easing."

2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"I do think that that will likely—and, by the way, you see, you know, a lot of discussion on both sides of the aisle, on both sides of the Hill that suggests generally that there will be something."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"and I think I just would say that I think we’ll have a stronger recovery if we can just get at least some more fiscal support when it’s appropriate, you know, when it’s appropriate and in the size Congress thinks is appropriate."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,And.
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"And for a number of years there, in the middle of the recovery, fiscal policy was pretty tight."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,So I think all of us lived through the experience of the—of the years after the Global Financial Crisis.
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"Fortunately, for—you know, the economic recovery has exceeded, certainly, the downside cases that we were very concerned about and even, even exceeded—sort of exceeded the baseline expectations."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we’re, we’re going to take the economy as it comes, including all external factors."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"And then we—what we can do is, we can obviously support financial stability through our lending programs, and, and we can support demand through, through interest rates and asset purchases and that sort of thing."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we’re not taking our gains in financial market function for granted, although, admittedly, they’ve been very large."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,So the asset purchases are just another very important piece of the accommodative policy stance that we have.
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"That’s $1.44 trillion, if I remember my times tables."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"So it’s, it’s, it’s important."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, by the way, it also—it places enormous burdens on individuals who may have this happen to them at an important stage in their career."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, as you know, these—we’re buying $120 billion a month."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know—so that is one of the reasons why our response was so strong and so urgent at the beginning and why we called this, this set of risks out."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,And that holds down the whole economy.
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"And the record is, if you don’t get back in very fairly quickly, it can be harder to get back in."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s harder to get back in.
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,Your skills atrophy.
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"The risk is that, for example, people are out of the labor force for an extended period of time."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,And we’ve been talking about those since the very beginning of the pandemic.
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"So you did—you laid out nicely the, the risks of damage to the supply side of the economy, or “scarring,” as you put it."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks.
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"They lose their attachment to the labor force, and it’s harder to get back."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"Chair Powell, what is the risk that we come out of this with lower productivity; weaker labor force attachment; slower growth; and, important for your tools, Chair Powell, a cycle of lower real interest rates?"
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"And if you think this type of scarring is a risk, then I’m wondering, what’s stopping the Federal Reserve from having a more explicit dialogue with Congress about the particular types of fiscal support we might need to avoid this outcome to make sure that you push away from the zero boundary or that the economy does when we exit this?"
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"Right now, we think that this very large, effective program is delivering about the right amount of accommodation and support for the markets, and so it continues."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"So this is a big program, and it’s doing a lot of good."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.

2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Chair Powell."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"First, it’s great to see you’re okay."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"And it’s just providing a lot of support for, for economic activity and, by the way, removing just about the same amount of duration risk from private hands as QE3 did."
2020-11-05,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we also, today, you know, we had a full discussion of the options around quantitative ease—not quantitative easing, the asset purchase program, and, you know, we understand the, the ways in which we can adjust the parameters of it to deliver more accommodation if it turns out to be appropriate."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we’re monitoring it carefully, and it’s a mixed picture."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’re, we’re watching carefully to understand why that—why that many people have been let go and what are—really are the sources."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I, I just have to leave the question of what to do with fiscal policy on this to Congress."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Nonetheless, it’s a concern."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And thank you, Chair Powell."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,JAMES POLITI.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you, Michelle."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,You and the Fed have consistently said that the Fed is ready to provide the economy with more monetary support if needed and really stressed to policymakers generally that the dangers of not doing enough outweigh the risks of doing too much in a situation where there’s so much suffering in the economy.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,The guidance today sort of cements asset purchases for a longer period of time but is not a big new easing step.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Or is it because the Fed just doesn’t have the capacity to sort of build that bridge over the next four to five months for the—for the people who are struggling?
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So when the schools reopen, a significant part of that 1.3 million would go back to work."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,And is it because of the medium-term outlook improving?
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Why was now, with the short-term outlook deteriorating due to the new coronavirus surges, not the moment for a big new easing step?"
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,James Politi.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So that is—that is a significant—a significant part of that group is, is in education."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,I would say that the picture is mixed.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So it’s, it’s a very large number of people to be—to be out of work from just that one source."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks very much.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I’m just curious if you can give some detail about the damage that these budget deficits or the lack of aid specifically to state and local governments will have on the recovery and, specifically, with the municipal lending facility set to expire, what more the Fed might be able to do to fill that specific hole."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Okay.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So the state and local governments, they provide important critical services: safety, fire, police, health, all kinds of things like that."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"They’re, they’re really involved in people’s lives, state and local governments are, to, to a large extent."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"The decision whether to, to provide more fiscal support to them is entirely in the hands of Congress."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s actually significantly more than lost their jobs during the Global Financial Crisis.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, they’re in the middle of these discussions, and, and those, those are issues for them to decide."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"A number of other states have been surprised on the upside, where—and that’s because goods sales, for example—property taxes are—don’t move much year to year."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, the kind of sales taxes on goods—goods sales have been very high."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Income has been more or less replaced by, by the CARES Act—fully replaced, more than, in many cases."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So the concerns that we had at the very beginning of really serious, deep shortfalls and massive budget cuts on the part of state and local governments have not yet—have not yet occurred."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"What we’re seeing is, is that it’s different state to state."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And some states are having significant difficulties, others not so much."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"The real concern, though, that still emerges is, state and local governments are very large employers, and—one of the largest."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And so far, since the pandemic began, employment has dropped by 1.3 million in—of state and local government."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"What’s happened is, if you’re a state that has a significant exposure to tourism or to extracting energy from the ground—oil from the ground, or gas—you are probably, at least in those industries, feeling a significant loss of revenue."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Right.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s providing a tremendous amount of, of support for the economy."

2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Scott Horsley, NPR."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,SCOTT HORSLEY.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Some forecasters have suggested that there is a lot of pent-up demand for travel and entertainment and, and services and the like that might stop being pent up in a hurry if we do get to a point where the vaccine is widely distributed, and that the beaten-down service sector might have trouble meeting that demand in, in a hurry."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"How might that affect inflation, in your mind?"
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And would that be just a transient problem or, or something that might warrant closer scrutiny?"
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So that, that has all the markings of a transient increase in the price level."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So you can imagine that as people really want to travel again—let’s say, you know, that airfare, airfares—I’m just imagining this, right?—that they go up."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"But what inflation is, is a process whereby they go up year upon year upon year upon year."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And if—given the inflation dynamics that we’ve had over the last several decades, just a single, single sort of price-level increase has not resulted in ongoing price-level increases."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And that, that was—the problem back in the 1970s was, it was the combination of two things."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"One, when unemployment went down and resources got tight, prices started going up."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"But the second problem was that that—that that increase was persistent, there was a level of persistence."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Just as one example, the governor of Illinois announced roughly $700 million in early anticipated budget cuts to close the budget deficit, and the latest bipartisan stimulus proposal that’s being debated this week seems to be leaving out state and local aid at this point."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So if prices went up 6 percent this year, they’d go up 6 percent next year, because people would internalize."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Nonetheless, again, we will—are prepared to use our tools, and we will use them at such time and in such amounts as we—as we think would, would help."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I, I could go back, James, to what I said earlier, which is, this is—this is a very, very large asset purchase program."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we expect that, that with the virus, that that will improve—that condition will improve."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"We don’t think the economy suffers from a lack of, of highly accommodative financial conditions."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"If you look at the interest-sensitive parts of the economy, they’re performing very well."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,The parts that are not performing well are not struggling from high interest rates.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"They’re struggling from exposure to, to COVID, in a sense."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"These are—these are the businesses that, that are really hit hard by people’s reluctance to gather closely."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, so we, we do have the ability to—you know, to buy more bonds or to buy longer-term bonds."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, and we may—we may use it."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,I’m not saying we won’t—we won’t use that.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"It may well come to, to using that."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"But also, I would remind—I would also note, though, monetary policy works with “long and variable lags,” is the famous statement."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we think that the big effects from monetary policy are, you know, months and months into the future."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So this looks like a—you know, it looks like a time when what is really needed is fiscal policy."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, and that’s why it is, is a very positive thing that, that we’re getting that."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we, we remain open to doing—you know, to, to either increasing the size of our asset purchases, if that turns out to be appropriate, or to just moving the maturities, moving to buying longer maturities, because that had—that also increases accommodation by taking more duration risk out of the market."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,But we think our current stance is appropriate.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we think that our— you know, that our, our guidance on asset purchases today will also provide support to the economy over time."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Again, what we’ve—what we’ve done is, we’ve laid out a path whereby we’re going to keep monetary policy highly accommodative for a long time, really until—really until we reach very close to our goals, which is not, you know, not really the way it’s been done in the past."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So that’s, that’s providing significant support for the economy now."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,We think it’s suffering from the pandemic and people wanting to not engage in certain kinds of economic activity.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,I wanted to ask specifically about state and local aid.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, thank you."

2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Yesterday, I guess, the Fed said that it is joining the international financial greening group."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,And I just wanted to see if you could expand on how the Fed is thinking about climate change and how it might affect Fed policy going forward.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Specifically, I think Janet Yellen drew a distinction between considering climate change when it comes to financial regulation."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,But how do you see that also potentially affecting monetary policy?
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Obviously, there have been criticisms of the Fed for buying bonds of oil and gas companies."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"But leaving that specific case aside, I mean, are there—is there any way that climate change considerations could affect monetary policy going forward?"
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So the—you’re, you’re talking about the—sorry, the Network [of Central Banks and Supervisors] for Greening the Financial System, which we joined this week."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,And I’ll just—I’ll just say a couple things about that.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, first, I’ll just start by saying that we’re going to move carefully and thoughtfully on developing an understanding of how climate change affects our work, including the areas you mentioned."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’re going to do so with a great deal of engagement with all of our external constituencies, including the public and their elected representatives who are charged with our oversight."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,We’ll do it with great transparency.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Remember that we are a nonpolitical agency whose goals and authorities to achieve those goals are set by Congress.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,We have great responsibilities and strong authorities that we’ll use vigorously.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’re not the forum where all the great issues of the day are to be hashed out, debated, and addressed unless and only to the extent that those issues are directly relevant to our statutory goals and are addressable through our legal authorities."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,And markets have moved in ways that suggest it is credible.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,There have been significant movements since we announced the framework in the direction that is consistent with the—with the framework being credible to market participants.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mean, really, really, that’s what happens is, people internalize that they can raise prices, and that it’s okay to pay prices that are going up at that rate."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, we’ve been having very long expansions since—in, in the last several decades because inflation has not—really, the old model was, inflation would come along and the Fed would tighten, and we’d have a recession."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Now inflation has been low, and we haven’t had that dynamic."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And the result has been three of the four longest expansions in, in modern history, in recorded history."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, you know, we’re, we’re thinking that this could be another long expansion, and that we’ll keep our—what we’re saying is, we’re going to keep policy highly accommodative until the expansion is well down the tracks."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,And we’re not going to preemptively raise rates until we see inflation actually reaching 2 percent and being on track to exceed 2 percent.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"That’s a very strong commitment, and we think that’s the right place to be."

2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"I’m just going to add, markets have actually found this fairly credible."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"If you look at what—at inflation compensation and at the survey measures of, of when the Fed will lift off, everything has moved."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I, I don’t think it’s something that—I, I mean, I’m actually pleased by, by the reception it’s gotten in markets."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And thank you, Michelle."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And because we have a narrow remit, and because we stick to it, Congress has given us a precious grant of independence from direct political control."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,But—so let me—let me get to your question.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I, I would be very reluctant to see us move in that direction, picking one area as creditworthy and another not."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,So you asked about monetary policy.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, it’s, it’s—for now, I would say the real—the real concern is—the real place to focus, for me, is supervision of financial institutions and then financial stability concerns."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,You can see a connection there.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Monetary policy, maximum employment, stable prices—it’s less obvious to me."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"I can—I can, you know—I can make the argument, but it’s less obvious to me that those should be first-order things that we would look at in connection with climate change."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,But I think there’s—I think there’s work to be done to understand the connection between climate change and the strength and resilience of financial markets and financial institutions.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,I think that work is in its early days.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, again, we’ll be careful."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’ll be thorough and transparent and, and engage with the public on all that."

2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Chair Powell."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s something we’ve carefully avoided.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So society’s broad response to climate change is for others to decide—in particular, elected leaders."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"In fact, our agreement with Treasury during the financial crisis from back in 2009 or ’10 says that we will avoid credit allocation."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, I—I’ll say this."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,What does all that mean for an issue like climate change?
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,And why did we join the NGFS?
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So Congress hasn’t explicitly assigned us or other financial regulators a role, and we’re not among the agencies who contribute to the National Climate Assessment—Climate Assessment, for example."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,But climate change is nonetheless relevant to our existing mandates under the law.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,And let me tell you why.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,One of our jobs is to regulate and supervise banks and to look after the stability of the financial system.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s a responsibility we share with other agencies.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,The public will expect that we will—we will do that.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we’ll, we’ll expect that, that those important institutions will be resilient against the many resists—risks that they fake—face: credit risk, market risk, cyber risk."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Climate change is an emerging risk to financial institutions, the financial system, and the economy."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we are, as so many others are, in the very early stages of understanding what that means, what needs to be done about it, and by whom."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s why 83 central banks have joined together to share research and identify best practices in this important emerging area.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’ve been attending NGFS meetings as an observer for more than a year, taking part in the work."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,We had discussed that it was probably time to join as a member.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,I’ll just say that the financial system is really a global one.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s important that we work and discuss best practices with peer agencies around the world, especially in a field where we’re just beginning to develop our, our understanding."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,You asked about monetary policy.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"We, we have historically shied away strongly from taking a role in credit allocation."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,So that was the inflation—those are the inflation dynamics of that era.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So the broad financial stability picture is, is kind of mixed, I would say."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,There—the connection between low unemployment or other resource utilization and inflation is so much weaker than it was.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Nonfinancial corporate leverage is high.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,We’ve been watching that.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, you know, rates are really low."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So—and so companies have been able to handle their debt loads even in weak periods, because rates are— rates are quite low."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Your interest payments are low.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Defaults and downgrades have, have declined since earlier in the year."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Households came into this very strong, and there certainly has been a hit there for people who are unemployed."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, you know, with the CARES Act, Congress replaced a lot of lost income."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, it’s very important that, that the economy gets strong again."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mean, the, the ultimate thing to support financial stability is a strong economy."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"The last thing is, is really funding markets."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"We found that there was a lot of unstable funding for companies, particularly financial companies."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And that’s, that’s down to a—to a very low level these days."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"I would say, you know, asset prices are, are a little high in that metric and in my view."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, overall, you have a mixed picture."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"You, you don’t have, you know, a lot of red flags on that."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So—and it’s—again, it’s something that we monitor essentially ongoing, almost daily."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,We look at leverage in the nonfinancial sector—that’s households and nonfinancial corporates.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, we’re, we’re monitoring these prices for that and, and have published our, our framework, and, you know, we’ll be held accountable for what we saw and what we missed."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So far, they’ve been a source of strength through this crisis, and their capital has held up well."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, we look at—we also look at borrowing—leverage of financial institutions."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Does that concern you at all?
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Are, are you getting any more concerned about asset valuations in, in light of the highly accommodative Fed policies?"
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"You, you were breaking up, but I, I think I got that."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,I think I got it.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, you know, financial stability—we, we look at a broad range of things."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"We actually have a framework so that we can, you know, be—evaluate changes in financial stability over time, and so that the public can evaluate whether we’re doing a job—a good job at it."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,We—so what do we look at?
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Asset prices is one thing that we look at.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, we published a report a few weeks ago on that—maybe it was month or so ago."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Good afternoon.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Anyway.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,And I think you’ll find a mixed bag there.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"It depends—with equities, it depends on whether you’re looking at P/Es or whether you’re looking at the premium over risk-free—over the risk-free return."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"If you look at P/Es, they’re historically high, but, you know, in a world where the— where the risk-free rate is sustain—is going to be low for a sustained period, the equity premium, which is really the reward you get for taking equity risk, would be what you’d look at."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And that’s not at, at incredibly low levels, which would mean that they’re not overpriced in that sense."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Admittedly, P/Es are high, but that’s—you know, that’s, that’s maybe not as relevant in a world where we think the 10-year Treasury is going to be lower than it’s been historically, from a—from a return perspective."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,We spent 10 years and the banks spent 10 years building up their capital.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"We [inaudible] on the stock market, bond yields remain very low."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,So we work very hard at it.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I’m certainly hoping—I think it will be very good for the economy if, if we did get something soon."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHAEL MCKEE.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Well, the argument for continuing to spend is that low interest rates make it affordable."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Do you worry you get in a situation where you would have congressional interference in monetary policymaking or at least feel significant political pressure to keep rates low because the country can’t afford to pay a significant interest bill?
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Yeah, I mean, that’s—I think we’re a very, very long way from that."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, the, the Congress has given the Fed independence on the condition that we stick to our knitting."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,We try very hard to do that.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I, I think that’s, that’s what people call fiscal dominance."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I, I think we’re just a very, very long way from that."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think, you know, if we—if we do our jobs well and support the economy and achieve maximum employment and stable prices, keep the financial system stable, I don’t think that that is something that will—that I would worry about, certainly not in the near term."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you very much.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"In terms of, you know, would, would it really speed it up a lot to, to move asset purchases, you know, I don’t think that would really be—I think it’s going to take a long time however you do it."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, you know, I’ll just say in the near term, I think fiscal—the case for, for fiscal is, is strong."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Again, these are—these are issues for Congress."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"In particular, you can look at the real interest rate payments, the amount of, what does it cost?"
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,And for the last question we’ll go to Michael McKee.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHAEL MCKEE.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Mr. Chairman, I have a couple of questions about the fiscal support for the economy."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,This year’s budget deficit is $3.1 trillion.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And Republicans have argued they don’t want to spend more, because we can’t afford it."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,So I’m wondering if you can make the case for how much we can afford.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,At what point do deficits and the debt start to have an impact on the economy or on interest rates?
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,And how would we know when we get there?
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So people who—people who run for elected office and win, they’re the ones—their reward is they get to make those very difficult decisions."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And—you know, so we’re not charged with providing fiscal advice to, to Congress."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"But I, I would just say, as a general—as a general rule, it is important to be on a sustainable fiscal path."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"For my way of thinking and many others’, the time to focus on that is when the economy is strong and when unemployment is low and taxes are—you know, are, are pouring in, and there’s, there’s room to get on—get on a sustainable path, because the economy’s really doing well."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"You’re still now in the—in the, you know, some part of, of an economic crisis."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And the fact that Congress is debating a fairly large bill today suggests that, that—you know, suggests that something fairly substantial is going to get done, we hope—that what’s being discussed is, you know, is, is of some size."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"In terms of what is a sustainable level, I think, you know, it’s—the question is—we’ve always looked at debt to GDP, and we’re very high by that measure."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"By some other measures, we’re actually not that high."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And from that standpoint, if you—if you sort of take real interest costs of the federal deficit and divide that by GDP, we’re actually—you know, we’re actually on a more sustainable fiscal path if you look at it through those eyes."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Those dynamics are not in place anymore.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"The equity market and the bond market seem to be telling two different stories about where, where things are heading."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,You’ve been asked this question before in various forms.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,He had some questions about it.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,So I wanted to know where you stood on that issue.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Right.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,So—you were breaking up a little.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think—I think I got the sense of it, though."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Yes, I, I don’t think it’s at all a foregone conclusion that there needs to be a permanent Fed presence."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we certainly don’t—you know, that’s not something we’re planning on or intending."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Right now we’re buying assets because it’s a—you know, it’s a—it’s a time when the economy needs highly accommodative monetary policy, and we think our asset purchases are, you know, one of the main delivery mechanisms for that, the size of the balance sheet."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, there’s lots of demand for, for U.S. Treasury paper all—from all over the world."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I, I think we need to be thoughtful about the structure of the Treasury market and look at ways to make sure that the capacity is there for it to be handled by the private sector."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And there’s, there’s quite a lot of work going on on that front."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"But I, I don’t presume at all that, that this is something that needs to be—where the Fed needs to be in there at all."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"I, I would think that this should be handled by the private sector and can be."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Institutions need to be able to hold this paper.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And there may be—there may be a central clearing angle that would, you know, net a lot of risk."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"That’s, that’s yet to be proven."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, I’m referring back to [inaudible] Randal Quarles."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,There are a lot of things that are being looked at right now.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"But what I wanted to ask was, you know, given the size of all the government borrowing and, you know, different regulatory changes in the financial sector, do you think that the Treasury market, long run, can operate smoothly without some sort of active Fed presence—you know, buying Treasury debt?"
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHAEL DERBY.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s still there, but it’s a—it’s a faint heartbeat compared to what it was."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And the persistence of inflation, if you—if you get a—for example, oil prices go up, and that’ll send a temporary shock through the economy."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"The persistence of that into, into inflation over time is just not there."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So they— what you describe may happen, and, of course, we would watch it very carefully."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"We, we understand that we will always be learning new things from the economy about how it will behave in certain cases."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"But I would—I would expect, though, going in that that would be a one-time price increase rather than an increase in underlying inflation that would be persistent."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,SCOTT HORSLEY.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So not the kind of thing that the Fed would, would be trigger-happy to, to— CHAIR POWELL."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,No.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,SCOTT HORSLEY.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,—respond to?
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"No, no."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Definitely not.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Michael Derby.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,[Inaudible]—question.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,I’m going to try it a little bit differently now.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHAEL DERBY.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"I was wondering if you’ve had any conversations yet with any members of the incoming Biden Administration, particularly Janet Yellen, who obviously you can share some similar experience in running the Fed."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,So just curious to get your thoughts on how the relationship with Treasury and the new Administration might differ than the past couple of years.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, you know, we’ve had a—and I’ve had sort of the typical meetings with the transition team for Treasury."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,They’ve met with quite a lot of people in our agency and other agencies.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, really, it’s about learning what we do."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I, I really have only spoken to former Chair Yellen to congratulate her on being nominated and just to say that I look forward to working with her."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, I did work very closely with her for five years before she left and have stayed in touch, you know."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,So I did that.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"But I have not discussed, you know, policy with her."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I, I’m not going to do that until she’s confirmed."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Great, thank you."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Jeff Cox.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,JEFF COX.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Yes.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Chair, thank you for taking the question."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Chair Powell—hi, Chair Powell."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,PAUL LA MONICA.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Hannah Lang.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,HANNAH LANG.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, hi."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks so much for taking our questions.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, you know, as you know, the pandemic has really disproportionately impacted small and medium-sized businesses."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,And the Fed launched a few efforts this year to—through its 13(3) programs to reach out to those companies.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, you know, considering that some of those programs are ending, is there anything else that the Fed’s actions can do to provide support to those companies?"
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Or is that solely Congress’s domain?
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think the main thing that those companies need is a—is a robust recovery—a strong, robust recovery."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And so we, we contribute to that through highly accommodative monetary policy, through accommodative financial conditions that are supporting economic activity."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Health authorities are contributing to that through, through, you know, management of the spread of the virus and now through vaccines and the delivery of those vaccines."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And Congress contributes, contributes to that by helping them make it through this very difficult time."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, and I think my understanding is that there’s support for small businesses in, in what’s being discussed on Capitol Hill."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,I would certainly think that would be something well worth looking at.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Paul La Monica.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"But we’re, we’re honest with ourselves and with the public that it will take some time to get there."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"The fiscal policy actions that have been taken thus far have made a critical difference to families, businesses, and communities across the country."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, and that’s why we have adopted the flexible average inflation-targeting framework."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I just went through what, what they—what they—the guidance that we put forward."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, so I guess since September we’ve now adopted a flexible average inflation-targeting framework."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,We have provided rate guidance that is tightly linked to the goals as expressed in that new framework.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And now we’ve done the same for, for asset purchases."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, you know, we’ve, we’ve been sort of—as, as the future has become clearer and as we’ve absorbed new developments in medical—in the medical sphere and also in, in the economy, we have—began to be able to see further."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we’ve, we’ve started to be able to provide further important guidance."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we think that the—that the asset purchase guidance, guidance is very important."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, you know, again, I would start with what we actually did at the meeting, which, which was, we provided this, this guidance about the path of asset purchases."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"We think that the, the prior language of “in coming months” was obviously temporary."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,We think that’s important.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,And we think that that is important to have done.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"I, I would just add, though, that we also continue to think that our current policy stance is appropriate."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,We think it’s providing a great deal of support for the economy.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Financial conditions are highly accommodative.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, we monitor a range of financial condition indexes."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"There are many of them, and they’ll, they’ll all pretty much tell you that."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"This links that guidance, those purchases, to actual “substantial further progress” toward our, our mandated goals."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And regarding asset purchases, why not increase the duration of the asset purchases at this time, given what you see as a very challenging period ahead?"
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"You, you mentioned the next couple months are going to be very challenging."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And core inflation is 1.4, and the SEP sees it rising to 1.8 likewise."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Would that constitute “substantial further progress” toward the Committee’s maximum-employment and price-stability goals?
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Yes.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Well, so we’re not—we’re not going to be identifying specific—associating that test with, with specific numbers at this point."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, really, the question is, what do we mean by, by that language?"
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, really, the overarching message, Rich, is that our guidance for both interest rates and asset purchases will keep monetary policy accommodative until our maximum-employment and price-stability goals are achieved, and that’s, that’s a powerful message."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,So “substantial further progress” means what it says.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,It means we’ll be looking for employment to be substantially closer to assessments of its maximum level and inflation to be substantially closer to our 2 percent longer-run goal before we start making adjustments to our purchases.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"I would also point out that by increasing our asset holdings, we see ourselves as adding policy accommodation."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,There will come a time when the economy does not require increasing amounts of policy accommodation.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And when that time comes—and that will be uncertain and, in any case, is, is some ways off."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,So I can’t give you an exact set of numbers.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"We will—of course, as we approach that point, we’ll be evaluating that."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And when we see ourselves on a path to achieve that goal, then we will—we will say so undoubtedly well in advance of any time when we would actually consider gradually tapering the pace of purchases."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,RICH MILLER.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Very quickly on, on that."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"You can—you can also look at the interest sensitive parts of the economy—for example, housing, durable sales, vehicle sales—those parts of the economy are, are performing very, very well."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,The parts of the economy that are weak are the service-sector businesses that involve close contact.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Those are not being held back by financial conditions, but rather by the spread of the virus."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I’ll close by, by just saying, we do have the flexibility to provide more accommodation through the channel you mentioned and through other channels."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"We—but right now, we’re providing a great deal, and we think—we happen to think it’s the right amount."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, you, you mentioned—I think you’re referring to the idea of maintaining the duration but, but reducing the quantity, which is sort of what the Bank of Canada did."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And that, that is something that we—you know, that we talked about in the last meeting and was addressed in the minutes."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I would say, the views on that were mixed: Some thought it was an interesting idea, others not so much."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"I, I wouldn’t say that that’s something that’s, that’s high on our list of, of possibilities."

2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,VICTORIA GUIDA.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Victoria Guida with Politico."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,I wanted to ask about the 13(3) facilities.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Chair Powell, you’ve said that you accept Treasury Secretary Mnuchin’s interpretation of the statute of the CARES Act on, on what should happen with those programs."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, first of all, I’m curious whether under a new Treasury Secretary you will accept whatever legal interpretation they put forward for those programs."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And then, also, given that there isn’t a statutory requirement for you to have financial backing from Treasury for 13(3) facilities, do you have any plans for any future facilities that don’t require Treasury backing?"
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Anytime we feel like the economy could, could use stronger accommodation, we would be prepared to provide it."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Headline inflation is one time 1.2, the SEP median sees it rising to 1.8."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we look at where financial conditions are now, and, and we, we feel that they are appropriate for now."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, we, we look at our overall stance of policy, we look at overall financial conditions, we look at what’s going on in the economy—different parts of the economy, and we ask ourselves, should we change our policy stance?"
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we recognize that circumstances could shift in a way that warrants our, our doing that, including by adjusting purchases."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,We are committed to using our full range of tools to support the U.S. economy to achieve our goals.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,We will continue to use our tools to support the economy for as long as it takes until the job is well and truly done.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,No one should doubt that.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,RICH MILLER.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.

2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,NICK TIMIRAOS.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Nick Timiraos, the Wall Street Journal."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Chair Powell, a two-part question."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"What, if anything, would prompt the Fed to shift Treasury purchases toward the longer end of the curve as you did with your prior QE programs?"
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And does your guidance today on asset purchases foreclose the possibility that you could, at some point, lengthen maturities while simultaneously tapering the monthly purchase amounts?"
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Well, Nick, I—on, on the first part of the question, I, I don’t—I wouldn’t want to sort of talk about hypothetical situations."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,We do that at every meeting.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"I wonder if I could start with the, the SEP. We have—unemployment now is at 6.7, the SEP median sees, sees it falling to 5."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you, Michelle."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Looking ahead, FOMC participants project the unemployment rate to continue to decline; the median projection is 5 percent at the end of next year and moves below 4 percent by 2023."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"The economic downturn has not fallen equally on all Americans, and those least able to shoulder the burden have been the hardest hit."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s why we’re aiming for an overshoot.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,The economic dislocation has upended many lives and created great uncertainty about the future.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,The pandemic has also left a significant imprint on inflation.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Following large declines in the spring, consumer prices picked up over the summer but have leveled out more recently."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"For those sectors that have been most adversely affected by the pandemic, prices remain particularly soft."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Overall, on a 12-month basis, inflation remains below our 2 percent longer-run objective."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,The median inflation projection from FOMC participants rises from 1.2 percent this year to 1.8 percent next year and reaches 2 percent in 2023.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"As we have emphasized throughout the pandemic, the outlook for the economy is extraordinarily uncertain and will depend in large part on the course of the virus."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Recent news on vaccines has been very positive.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"However, significant challenges and uncertainties remain with regard to the timing, production, and distribution of vaccines as well as their efficacy across different groups."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,It remains difficult to assess the timing and scope of the economic implications of these developments.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"The ongoing surge in new COVID-19 cases, both here in the United States and abroad, is particularly concerning, and the next few months are likely to be very challenging."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,All of us have a role to play in our nation’s response to the pandemic.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Following the advice of public health professionals to keep appropriate social distances and to wear masks in public will help get the economy back to full strength.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,A full economic recovery is unlikely until people are confident that it is safe to engage—reengage in a broad range of activities.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Although there has been much progress in the labor market since the spring, we will not lose sight of the millions of Americans who remain out of work."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"As we previously announced, we are now releasing the entire package of our SEP materials at the same time as our FOMC statement."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Participation in the labor market remains notably below pre-pandemic levels.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"As with overall economic activity, the pace of improvement in the labor market has moderated."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Transcript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference December 16, 2020 CHAIR POWELL."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Good afternoon.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"At the Federal Reserve, we are strongly committed to achieving the monetary policy goals that Congress has given us—maximum employment and price stability."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Since the beginning of the pandemic, we have taken forceful actions to provide relief and stability, to ensure that the recovery will be as strong as possible, and to limit lasting damage to the economy."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Today my colleagues on the FOMC and I reaffirmed our strong forward guidance for interest rates and also provided additional guidance for our asset purchases.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Together, these measures will ensure that monetary policy will continue to deliver powerful support to the economy until the recovery is complete."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Economic activity has continued to recover from its depressed second-quarter level.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"The substantial reopening of the economy led to a rapid rebound in activity, and real GDP rose at an annual rate of 33 percent in the third quarter."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"In recent months, however, the pace of improvement has moderated."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Household spending on goods, especially durable goods, has been strong and has moved above its pre-pandemic level."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"In contrast, spending on services remains low, especially in sectors that typically require people to gather closely, including travel and hospitality."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"The overall rebound in household spending owes in part to federal stimulus payments and expanded unemployment benefits, which provided essential support to many families and individuals."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"The housing sector has fully recovered from the downturn, supported in part by low mortgage interest rates."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Business investment has also picked up.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"The recovery has progressed more quickly than generally expected, and forecasts from FOMC participants for economic growth this year have been revised up since our September Summary of Economic Projections."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Even so, overall economic activity remains well below its level before the pandemic, and the path ahead remains highly uncertain."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"In the labor market, more than half of the 22 million jobs that were lost in March and April have been regained, as many people were able to return to work."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Job growth slowed to 245,000 in November, and while the unemployment rate has continued to decline, it remains elevated at 6.7 percent."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So on your—on your first question, we really have not thought about that."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Included in these materials are two new exhibits that show how the balance of participants’ assessments of uncertainty and risks have evolved over time.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"In terms of risks to the outlook, fewer participants see the balance of risks as weighted to the downside than in September."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,The Fed cannot grant money to particular beneficiaries.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,We can only create programs or facilities with broad-based eligibility to make loans to solvent entities with the expectation that the loans will be repaid.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Many borrowers are benefiting from these programs, as is the overall economy."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"But for many others, getting a loan that may be difficult to repay may not be the answer."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"In these cases, direct fiscal support may be needed."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Elected officials have the power to tax and spend and to make decisions about where we, as a society, should direct our collective resources."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Even so, the current economic downturn is the most severe of our lifetimes."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"It will take a while to get back to the levels of economic activity and employment that prevailed at the beginning of this year, and it may take continued support from both monetary and fiscal policy to achieve that."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"To conclude, we understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Everything we do is in service to our public mission.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,We are committed to using our full range of tools to support the economy and to help assure that the recovery from this difficult period will be as robust as possible.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,I look forward to your questions.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Rich Miller.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,RICH MILLER.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"As I have emphasized before, these are lending powers, not spending powers."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Since the onset of the pandemic, nearly all participants continue to judge the level of uncertainty about the economic outlook as elevated."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"When the time comes, after the crisis has passed, we will put these emergency tools back in the box."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"We have deployed these lending powers to an unprecedented extent, enabled in large part by financial backing and support from Congress and the Treasury."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"While a little more than half of participants now judge risks to be broadly balanced for economic activity, a similar number continue to see risks weighted to the downside for inflation."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"The Fed’s response to this crisis has been guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people, along with our responsibilities to promote the stability of the financial system."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"As noted in our Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, we view maximum employment as a broad-based and inclusive goal."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Our ability to achieve maximum employment in the years ahead depends importantly on having longer-term inflation expectations well anchored at 2 percent.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"As we reiterated in today’s statement, with inflation running persistently below 2 percent, we will aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time so that inflation averages 2 percent over time and longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2 percent."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,We expect to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until these employment and inflation outcomes are achieved.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"With regard to interest rates, we continue to expect it will be appropriate to maintain the current 0 to ¼ percent target range for the federal funds rate until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee’s assessment of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"In addition, as we noted in today’s policy statement, we will continue to increase our holdings of Treasury securities by at least $80 billion per month and of agency mortgage-backed securities by at least $40 billion per month until substantial further progress has been made toward our maximum-employment and price-stability goals."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,We believe the increase in our balance sheet this year has materially eased financial conditions and is providing substantial support to the economy.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Combined with our forward guidance for the federal funds rate, our enhanced balance sheet guidance will ensure that the stance of monetary policy remains highly accommodative as the recovery progresses."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Our guidance is outcome based and is tied to progress toward reaching our employment and inflation goals.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thus, if progress toward our goals were to slow, the guidance would convey our intention to increase policy accommodation through a lower expected path of the federal funds rate and a higher expected path of the balance sheet."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Overall, our interest rate and balance sheet tools are providing powerful support to the economy and will continue to do so."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"The Federal Reserve has also been taking broad and forceful actions to more directly support the flow of credit in the economy for households, for businesses large and small, and for state and local governments."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Preserving the flow of credit is essential for mitigating damage to the economy and promoting a robust recovery.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Many of our programs rely on emergency lending powers that require the support of the Treasury Department and are available only in very unusual circumstances, such as those we find ourselves in today."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,These programs serve as a backstop to key credit markets and have helped to restore the flow of credit from private lenders through normal channels.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Although funds from the CARES Act will not be available to support new loans or new purchases after—of assets after December 31, the Treasury could authorize support for emerging lending facilities, if needed, through the Exchange Stabilization Fund."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’re, we’re very focused on—we have a lot to do now."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"In particular, the high level of joblessness has been especially severe for lower-wage workers in the service sector and for African Americans and Hispanics."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Your second question is—sorry.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you for the question, Mr. Chairman."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So with the actions that you’ve currently taken, how do you—how do you further fight a slowdown that you’re seeing?"
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’ve talked about the retail sales numbers are a little bit sluggish this month, the unemployment, the job growth has slowed down."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Is there more the Fed can do to fight this?
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Or is it now squarely in the Congress’s realm?
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"There is more that we can do, certainly."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,EDWARD LAWRENCE.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"We can—we can expand our, our asset purchase programs."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,There are a number of options we would have to provide more support to the economy.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I would—I would say, though, that in the near term, the help that people need isn’t just from low interest rates that stimulates demand over time and works with long and variable lags."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s really support.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"As the—as—we’ve, we’ve talked about this as all of these government policies trying to work together to create a bridge across this chasm, economic chasm that was created by the pandemic."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And for many Americans, that bridge is there and, and they’re across it."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"But there’s a group for, for which they, they don’t have a bridge yet."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,And that’s who we’re talking about here.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,We can focus them more on the longer end.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Edward Lawrence.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, so we monitor basically just about every asset price in the economy, and housing prices are something that we’ve been monitoring."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,And you see them moving up.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,You see very high demand.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"This, this is the housing market that people have been expecting since, you know, 2010."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, and then, you know, not many, when the—when the pandemic hit, thought, “Oh, this is what—this is what will produce that housing market,” but it has."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Now, I would say, from a financial stability standpoint, housing prices are not—are not of a level of concern right now."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s just reflective of a lot of demand.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, builders are going to bring forth supply."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"There’s also a sense that this—some of this may be pent-up demand from when the economy was closed, which would imply that demand—once that demand is met, that the real level of demand will be more manageable."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,So it’s a—it’s a healthy economy now.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"We, we met recently with a bunch of homebuilders, and many of them in the business 30, 40 years said they’ve never seen the likes of it."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, no, housing prices themselves are not—are not a financial stability concern at the moment."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,We will watch that carefully.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"But in the near term, I wouldn’t think that that’s an issue that we’d be concerned about."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,JEANNA SMIALEK.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s, it’s the 10 million people who lost their jobs."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s people who may lose their homes.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s—you know, you see the, the—many, many millions of Americans are, are waiting in food lines in their cars these days all over the country."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,So we know there’s need out there.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, in terms of the vaccine, yes, you know, we do estimates of, of when the United States would reach herd immunity, and they’re, they’re going to be similar to what other people think."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, it depends on your assumptions, such as how many people will actually take the vaccine and how fast will the rollout be."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,So it’s assumption based on assumption based on assumption.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, you know, sometime—it’s possible sometime in the middle or second half of next year."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, our people are very good, but they’re looking at, at the same data as other people are."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And so, you know, all the estimates are—it depends on what your assumptions are."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"But under a normal set of assumptions, it could happen as, as soon as the middle of next year."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"In terms of the, you know, inflation, a couple things—your second question."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, we’re—I think you have to be honest with yourself about, about inflation these days."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"There are—there are significant disinflationary pressures around the world, and there have been for a while, and they persist today."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s, is not going to be easy to have inflation move up."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,And it isn’t going to be just a question—it’s going to take some time.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,It took a long time to get inflation back to 2 percent in the last crisis.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, we’re, we’re honest with ourselves and with you in the SEP that even with the very high level of accommodation that we’re providing both through low rates and very high levels of asset purchases, it will take some time, because that’s what we believe the underlying inflation dynamics are in our economy."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,And that’s sort of why we’re—one reason why we’re concerned about inflation is that we see that.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"We, we have not focused on, on that question, and I, I really have nothing to add on that."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Some might argue that you need to do more to start fixing those expectations, and to let this drift and say “We’re going to miss our target for another three years” doesn’t show a very firm commitment to the new framework."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, if so, what can the Fed do to contain those?"
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, secondly, if you could, please connect with me the lack of movement on the decision to maintain the current pace and quantities of bond purchases with the fact that the SEPs are showing three years with inflation not reaching 2 percent."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Two, two quick questions."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"We know there are small businesses all over the country that, that have been basically unable to really function, and they’re just hanging on."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So—and, and they’re, they’re so critical to our economy."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So—and, by the way, now that we can—we can kind of see the light at the end of the tunnel, it would be—it would be bad to see, you know, people losing their business, their life’s work in many cases, or even generations’ worth of work, because they couldn’t last another few months, which is what it amounts to."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,So we have more we can do.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we’ll—I, I think more the issue is, we’re going to need to continue to provide support to this economy for quite a period of time, because the, the economy will be growing in expectation."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,We should be growing at a fairly healthy clip by the second half of next year.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"But it’s going to be a while before we really are back to the levels of, of labor market—the, the sort of conditions in the labor market that we had in early this year and for much of the last couple of years."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,So that’s how I think about it.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,EDWARD LAWRENCE.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Howard Schneider.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,HOWARD SCHNEIDER.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Chair Powell."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks for doing this.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And thanks, Michelle."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"One, on the vaccine, do you have, or has the Fed modeled, sort of a working estimate of when the U.S. might reach something approaching herd immunity?"
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And so I guess I wonder, are you worried about valuation pressures there?"
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"I’m not going to try to be precise, because it’s just another estimate."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"They were mentioned in the most recent minutes as, you know, potentially a valuation concern, especially as it related to your mortgage-backed security purchases."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and happy New Year."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"I know how much you enjoy talking about fiscal stimulus, so let me ask you directly about fiscal stimulus."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,There’s talk right now of a $900 billion fiscal stimulus program in Congress.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Is, is that sufficient?"
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Is that what you’re looking for?
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Do you think that’ll be sufficient for helping the economy?
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Finally, you talked about the idea of how concerning the recent surge is."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,I wonder if you can put some detail on that.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"How much concern do you have in terms of, where could employment go?"
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,What could happen to GDP in the first quarter as a result of this surge?
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Okay.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So on, on fiscal policy, I would just say a couple of things."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"The case for fiscal policy right now is, is very, very strong."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I think that is widely understood, I would say, now."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,The details of it are entirely up to Congress.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,STEVE LIESMAN.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"But with the expiration of unemployment benefits—some of the unemployment benefits, the expiration of eviction moratoriums with the virus spreading the way it is, there’s a need for households and businesses to have, have fiscal support."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Steve Liesman.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Oh, if there were no—yes."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,And you mentioned earlier today that the housing market looks more or less fully healed.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"No, we, we would have the ability—certainly, we would have the ability to do facilities under 13(3) in some cases with no backing."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"But we can’t do any 13(3) facilities without the approval of the Treasury Secretary, right?"
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,But we did some facilities—I think one of our facilities this time didn’t have any Treasury backing.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,And I think some in the—in the round of—during the Global Financial Crisis also didn’t have any.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,VICTORIA GUIDA.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"I would say that we are—you know, we’re—we have the authorities we have."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"We will use them if, if they’re needed and if—and if the law permits us to do so."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,We would—we would always do that.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"We, we do not have any plans for, for the future about this."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"We—we’re very focused on, on getting through year-end."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’ve been very focused on, on the issues that are right in front of us."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, honestly, we’re not—we’re not planning on anything or having any discussions about what we might do down the road."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,VICTORIA GUIDA.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I do think that—again, I think that is widely understood."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So do you have any plans—like, would you consider doing more facilities if that became necessary without Treasury backing?"
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s not up to us to judge that work.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"You have to think that sometime in the middle of next year, you will—you will see people feeling comfortable going out and engaging in a broader range of activities."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,And some people will be probably quick to do that.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Some are doing it now without a vaccine—right?—in many parts of the country.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, nonetheless, my expectation—and I think many people have the expectation that the second half of next year should—the economy should be performing strongly."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"We should be— you know, we should be getting people back to work."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Businesses should be reopening and that kind of thing.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"The issue is more the next four or five months—getting through the next four, five, six months."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,That is key.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, and, you know, clearly there’s going to be need for help there."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, and, you know, my sense and hope is that we’ll be getting that."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,JEANNA SMIALEK.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Chair Powell."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about house prices.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I think it would be—I, I certainly would welcome the work that Congress is doing right now."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you for taking our questions.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Again, we don’t have any experience with this."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,And so then what will be—how will that play into economic activity?
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Jeanna Smialek.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,They’re getting vaccinated.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And by the end of the first quarter into the second quarter, you’re going to be seeing significant numbers of people vaccinated."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s—you know, it’s obviously a substantial bill."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"On the surge, you know, so it’s a really interesting question."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we’ve overestimated the, the effects on the economy of, of these spikes we’ve been having."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Now, this spike is so much larger that I think—and I think forecasters generally do think that there—that this will have an effect on suppressing activity, particularly activity that involves people getting together in bars and restaurants, on airplanes and hotels and things like that."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s really, really theirs."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,And you’re starting to see that.
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"In the—in the high-frequency data, you’re now beginning to see that show up."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"We have, and others too, have consistently expected there to be more economic—that, that cases would hold—growth in cases would hold back the economy more than it actually has."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Now, how big will it be?"
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"At the same time, people are getting vaccinated now."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"The first quarter will, will certainly show significant effects from this."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I think if this is—the case numbers are so high and so widespread across the country that that, that seems like it must happen."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And you’ll see the first quarter could well be—what, what we said is that coming months are going to be challenging."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I, I don’t have a view for you on, on the size of it."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"The general expectation is, you’re seeing some slowing now."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, there are—there are a lot of estimates."
2020-12-16,Press Conf - Full Text,We don’t—we don’t really know.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s, it’s in the near term."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s not in the medium term.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"We were thinking—when we were thinking “medium term,” we were thinking of longer-term scarring and things like that."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"Nonetheless, I mean, I think what—to go to your, your second question, and as I mentioned in my, in my opening remarks—there is good evidence to, to support a stronger economy in the second half of this year."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"In fact, if you look at, at—as we do—look at a range of private forecasters, what was their forecast in, in December, and what’s their forecast now?"
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,Right across the board: much higher forecasts for 2021 growth.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"And that’s because of the ongoing rollout of the vaccines and also because of fiscal policy, expectations, and the reality of, of the CRRA Act [Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021] getting done."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,So there is—there is a positive case there.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"I don’t know when we’re going to come back to work, and I’m, I’m actually in the Eccles Building here today."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"But that—think of that as—the sort of base case is, is a strong economy in the second half of the year."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,We used an adjective.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"It was “considerable”—“considerable risks to the economic outlook.” So there are considerable risks, risks to the economic outlook."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"Nonetheless, that is—that is a more positive outlook."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"And that’s really how, how I would—I would parse that for you."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,The language says that there’s still—I forget the exact language—downside risks.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"Or is it more that you’re, you’re worried it could last longer than you expect?"
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s the arrival of new strains that, that are more contagious and perhaps more virulent."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"But as of now, there haven’t been any discussions at all."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,And I don’t know when that’ll be.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"Howard Schneider, Reuters."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,HOWARD SCHNEIDER.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"And those are the—those are the—and also just the ongoing—third thing, of course, is the ongoing spread of the virus."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thanks, Chair Powell, for doing this."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"In the statement, you removed—regarding the coronavirus—you removed the time reference “short and medium term” when it comes to the risks to the economic outlook, and it simply now says “considerable risks to the economic outlook.” Should we read that as a sort of a positive change that you, you now see an end—sort of the endgame of this down the road?"
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"And a related issue, have you given any guidance yet to the Fed staff or System on when the Fed itself might resume in-person events?"
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,Yes.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"So in the statement, on the language, we dropped “in the medium term,” because, really, the risks are, are in the near term, frankly."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, as I mentioned, it’s the rollout of the vaccine."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,So a couple questions on timing.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mean, we—I can’t wait to be working in person again."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,And we haven’t made a decision about whether to continue them in the second quarter or not.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,We really have.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, and I’m pleased with where we are."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"Let’s remember that the banks—that the banks that are subject to the stress tests have taken very, very large reserves—very large loss reserves, and also increased their capital."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,They’ve actually had—they have higher capital ratios now than they had at the beginning of the pandemic.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,So the banking system has held up well here.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, and—but, you know, we’re going to be careful about this and, you know, move based on data, and all of the data, when we make that decision."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think we’ve been careful about, about rolling back those restrictions."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,EDWARD LAWRENCE.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"Mr. Chairman, thank you for taking the question."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,So I’m interested in the housing sector.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"Home prices are rising, 9 percent in some areas, because of low interest rates."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"And once we start having those, those meetings, of course, I’ll observe, you know, the long-standing practice of not talking about confidential discussions."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,Are you concerned about a bubble forming there yet?
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,Edward Lawrence.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, you know, we—we’ve been able to work successfully remotely."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,All of those things will go into our assessment of what the right answer is to that question.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we’re, we’re monitoring that on an ongoing basis, continue to—continuing to evaluate our, our restrictions."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, we’re not going to push people when they’re uncomfortable."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,We’re going to wait till people are comfortable and wait till it’s well and truly time to get back together in person.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,HOWARD SCHNEIDER.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’re just going to look at bank—we’re going to look at the whole range of, of information, including economic activity, banking activity, the, the success in vaccination."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,Hannah Lang.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Chair Powell."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you so much for taking our questions.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,The Fed in December eased its restrictions on bank dividend payments and share repurchases.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,And so I wanted to ask what factors the Fed will be looking at to determine what level banks can pay out in the second quarter and when we can expect such a decision.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,Okay.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,HANNAH LANG.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"Now, I’ve had no discussions with anybody at Treasury on that, because I haven’t had any discussions with anybody at Treasury other than meet—you know, high-level meetings with the—with the transition team a month or so ago."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"I’m more concerned about that than about the possibility, which exists, of higher inflation."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,We’re going to continue to monitor financial and credit conditions throughout the economy.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"I, I would say that, again, we have been struggling with disinflationary forces for some time."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"If you look around the world—look in Western Europe, look at Japan—around the world, large economies have, have felt much more downward pressure on inflation, have fallen short of their inflation goals, for some time now."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,That is the broad global macroeconomic context that we all live in.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we believe that those global forces—which are, you know, aging demographics, advancing technology, and globalization—those, those forces are still in effect."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"Now, they may slow down, and, and it’s, it’s an interesting question, the extent to which, for example, globalization may slow down or even reverse."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, specifically, how worried should lawmakers be about, you know, causing concerning levels of inflation?"
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"Notwithstanding that, inflation dynamics in the United States have, have consisted of a flat Phillips curve and low persistence for, for a long time."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"It may evolve over time, but significant time."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, these things are—these things are, are changing, but they don’t change at a rapid rate."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"And there’s—I, I don’t believe that, that they will."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I wouldn’t—I’m, I’m not—I’m much more worried about falling short of a complete recovery and losing people’s careers and lives that they—that they built because they don’t get to work—back to work in time and things like that."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"I’m more concerned about that and the damage that will do not just to their lives, but to the United States economy, to the productive capacity of the economy."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"Frankly, we welcome slightly higher inflation, somewhat higher inflation."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,We do not expect in the near term that that will change significantly.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"The kind of troubling inflation that people like me grew up with seems, seems far away and unlikely in, in the both domestic and global context that we’ve been in for some time."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,Do you expect more aid directly to consumers to be inflationary?
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,I just wanted to go back to fiscal stimulus for a second.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"And is there a price increase, you know, that you’re looking at where it might change the level of mortgage-backed securities the Fed is buying?"
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, honestly, no—you know, the whole focus on exit is premature, if I may say."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’re focused on finishing the job we’re doing, which is to support the economy, to give the economy the support it needs."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,There are people out there who’ve lost their jobs.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s essential that we get them back to work as quickly as possible, and we want to do everything we can to do that."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,And that is our primary focus right now.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, we just had a $900 billion package, and now Congress is talking about doing more."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s, it’s, it’s too soon to be—to be worried about that."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"But in the meantime, our focus is on giving the economy the support it needs."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,Victoria Guida.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,VICTORIA GUIDA.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Chair Powell."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, when we come to exit, we have a—we have an understanding of how to do that, and we’ll do it very carefully."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, and if the kind of emergency conditions arise that are required under that law, then our emergency lending tools will remain available."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"Steve Matthews, Bloomberg."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I’m, I’m absolutely sure that we’re going to do that."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"I, you know, haven’t—I haven’t spoken to, to Secretary Yellen—I’m going to be calling her “Chair Yellen” most of the time, so you just have to be patient with me—Secretary Yellen."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,I haven’t spoken to her since I congratulated her on being nominated.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"I do expect very soon to begin our regular calls or—and, and ultimately meetings, which have gone on, really, for, you know, 70 years."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"The Treasury Secretary and the, and the Fed Chair have had weekly or so meetings, lunches, breakfast, calls, depending on the situation."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,So I expect that will—that will happen soon.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"We know that we work together on some things to—you know, for the benefit of the public."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"I’ve—I have not met the, the President, President Biden."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,I wouldn’t want to comment one way or the other.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,STEVE MATTHEWS.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"Just to follow up briefly, you have some 13(3) emergency programs that will expire March 31 that the Fed and the Treasury have worked on together."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"Do you have an expectation of whether those will be left, left to expire then or whether they will be extended?"
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,So I—I’ll just say that I think our facilities were very successful in supporting the economy during its darkest moments and I believe saved—protected the loss of millions of jobs.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"And just, you know, I, I, I don’t—I don’t have any comment on your—on your last question."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,We know we have different authorities.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"Now, the way that works is, is that, you know, we know—the agencies know each other well, and this is true of finance ministries and central banks around the world."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,STEVE MATTHEWS.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"Chair Powell, Treasury Secretary Yellen, in a memo to her employees yesterday, spoke of the close working relationship with the Federal Reserve."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I’m wondering how you would describe the relationship with, with Treasury under Chair Yellen, if you’ve met with, with, with Treasury Secretary Yellen and, and/or President Biden since he has taken office."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, secondly, about that, as you know, in the last four years, there was constant criticism from the—of the Fed from the President and from other officials of the Administration."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"Do you have any kind of assurance or expectation that this will now be more of a hands-off attitude, in terms of commenting on monetary policy from the Administration?"
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,We know to stay in our lanes.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,Okay.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I’m, I’m sure that we’re going to have a, a good working relationship together."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,Absolutely sure.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,We’ll also have a good institutional relationship between the Fed and the Treasury.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I expect that that’ll be very good and, and very productive."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,It’ll be collaborative.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,We’ll work together.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,So I have the highest respect and admiration for Secretary Yellen.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, as a continuation of that, is the bubble in the corporate debt cycle more concerning for you?"
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, now, in terms of our tools, you know, of course, that project that I just mentioned is one for the broader society, for the private sector, for fiscal policy, but we have a role to play."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, on housing, you know, housing is now—the level of housing activity is at its highest level since before the Global Financial Crisis, in some measures."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mean, just, just take the financial markets, for example."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I think, if you go back to the—to the beginning, there was a real concern."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"Well, yes."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"Are, are there adaptations that caught you by surprise, maybe related to remote work or new ways to do on-site work, in-person, face-to-face work that, that the economy’s proven tougher than, than you expected at the outset of this pandemic?"
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"You said in your opening remarks that the, the economy in many ways had proven more resilient than, than people expected, and that that reflected the adaptability of both households and businesses."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thanks, Mr. Chairman."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,SCOTT HORSLEY.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"For the last question, we’ll go to Scott Horsley at NPR."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,And it’s something we’re strongly committed to.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s a—it’s a national goal and a national job, and we’re just going to do our part of the job."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,So I think everybody’s got a role to play here.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s lots of research, and, and it’s also, you know, our enforcement of the fair lending laws and things like that."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,But it’s a lot of activities in our Division of Consumer and Community Affairs.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, we do—we, we have such a focus on these issues now that we actually—we, we have a new, a webpage, relatively new, where you can access all of it."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"I strongly agree with that, as a matter of fact."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think if you look at either—look at employment gaps or unemployment gaps or wage gaps, wealth gaps, homeowning gaps, all of those persistent gaps that exist even controlling for many other factors, you will see that they’re, they’re persistent, they’re—and they’re very difficult to explain."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"And so it’s—the reason we talk about inequality and, and racial inequality in particular, is that it goes to our job, which is to achieve maximum employment, which, which links up with, with—we want—we want the potential output of the United States to be as high as it can possibly be."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"We want—we want an economy where everybody can take part and everybody, everybody can put their labor in, and they can share in the prosperity of our great economy."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s what we want.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"Suddenly, all of those big buildings all over the, the—New York City and all around the world where people work in the financial markets with terminals and everything, everybody had to go home, and they had to take their terminals with them."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"And that’s how the U.S. economy can be bigger, stronger, growing faster, is if we can achieve a more—a broader prosperity."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"Principally, when we say that the maximum employment is a, a broad and inclusive goal, what we’re—what we’re saying there is, we’re not just going to look at the headline—and we never did, really, but—we’re not going to just look at the headline numbers."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’re going to look at different demographic groups, including women, minorities, and others."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we’re not going to say that we’ve reached maximum employment, which is our statutory goal, until we’ve reached maximum employment."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"And you haven’t if, if there’s lots of pockets of, of people not participating in or not employed in the labor market."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,So those are the things that we can do.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,We also do a tremendous amount of research on these issues.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, and that is, how we think about the labor market."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,And I think there was a real concern that there would be a tremendous loss of functionality just at the time when the financial markets were under historically difficult conditions.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"And yet, it worked out okay."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I think people—many people in the financial sector are still working with their terminals at home, including people on trading floors or on virtual trading floors."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,Housing is a great example.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, the way—the way—the way the housing industry worked, that when you buy a house, there was a lot of in-person contact."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"They managed to pretty much immediately go to a more virtual—you know, with all the technology."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,They were able to completely avoid that.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"And the housing market has been really strong, notwithstanding that it’s, it’s now quite virtual rather than in person."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"So there’s been a lot of adapting, and—but you can’t adapt, you know, hotels, sporting venues, movie theaters, restaurants, bars."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,They are.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"You just—you know, those are just going to—and that’s—again, that’s millions and millions of people."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,And we need to—we need to finish the job.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we—it’s, it’s within our power to do that as a country this year."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,And I would just urge that—and I know people are working hard on that.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"But that, that is really the main thing about the economy, is, is getting the pandemic under control, getting everyone vaccinated, getting people wearing masks, and all that."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s the single most important economic growth policy that we can have.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,We’re going to be very transparent.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"And so you’re just going to have to defeat the pandemic, which, as I mentioned, you know, we, we have a plan to do that, but we haven’t done it yet."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, if so, what can the Fed do proactively to narrow those racial gaps in income and wealth, including potentially through regulatory policy?"
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, even purchasing manager index and sentiment indexes on, on areas of the economy that are not directly—really directly—exposed to the pandemic in their economic activity, they’re doing okay."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"There’s another 100,000 in similar kinds of activities."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"Now, some of that’s reversing now."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"But we have definitely learned that we can do more work from home in many, many different lines of work."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"Of course, that’s not possible if your job involves being at a place, doing personal services."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"For many people, it’s not possible."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"And that’s very much something that skews to higher-income, higher-educated people being able to work from home and others not so much."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,So I think we’ve learned that.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"But if you go—if you look elsewhere, it’s not having an effect."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"The other thing, though, even conditional on that, when we saw the wave in the South and the West, the wave of cases this summer, I think, intuitively, having seen what happened in March and April, we expected there to be a significant hit to economic activity."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, and it didn’t actually—it had a much smaller effect on economic activity than we expected."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"Then comes the fall wave, which is just so much larger—a very, very large wave as, as was very much forecast."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"People going indoors, the cold weather, all of that."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"And even there, if you look at—I would say, look at the December jobs report."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, big job losses in, you know, in that part of the service sector."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I mentioned 400,000 jobs in bars and restaurants."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"And people kind of just got on with their lives and went and, and dealt with it."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,Do you agree that racial disparities are currently a drag on the economy?
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"If I could ask this quick follow—yesterday Susan Rice, domestic policy advisor at the White House, talked about a Citigroup study that said closing racial economic gaps could add up to $5 trillion to the U.S. economy over the next five years and 6 million new jobs."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,Great.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"So they’re having to reverse some of their loss reserves, actually."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"Debts—corporate debt spreads are, are tight."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,They’ve tightened.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"They were very broad—high—wide, of course, at the—during the acute phase of the pandemic, and they’ve— you know, they’re now at the lower end of their typical range."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,And we do monitor that.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, it’s, it’s not something we can control or operate on directly, but we do—we do watch those things."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s just not materializing.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, in a sense, it’s good that companies have been able to finance themselves during this period, because they—they’ve been able to stay in business."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, that’s a good thing."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"And that’s, that’s part of highly accommodative financial conditions."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,Chris Rugaber.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,CHRISTOPHER RUGABER.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,They’ve been able to keep their employees working.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"Banks are not experiencing the kinds of defaults that, that we all were concerned about in the early months of the pandemic."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"There were a lot of downgrades and some defaults at the beginning, and those have really slowed down."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,So we’ve had a very strong rebound in housing.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"Some of the, the tightness in housing markets, we think—which has led to the, the significant price increases this year—we think is, is a passing phenomenon."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"There’s a one-time thing happening with people who are spending all of their time in their house, and they’re thinking either “I need a bigger house” or “I need another house and a different house—or a second house,” in some cases."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"So there’s just—there’s a—there’s a one- time shift in demand that we think will get satisfied—also, that will call forth supply."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"And that will—that will, we think—we think that those price increases are unlikely to be sustained for, for all of those reasons."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, by the way, the same is true for bank loans."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"So you asked about corporate debt, I guess?"
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,Yes.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,I’m just concerned if that’s a bubble that you’re watching.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we, we monitor pretty much all of the big financial markets pretty carefully."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, what’s happened in, in the corporate debt market, beginning with the announcement of our corporate credit facility, has been, you’ve seen lenders lending and borrowers borrowing."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,You’ve seen relatively significantly fewer defaults than we—than we expected.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,EDWARD LAWRENCE.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"Can you—since you suggested that the concern from the pandemic is perhaps a shorter-term concern and that’s why you removed some of the language from the statement, can you talk about what kind of impact you’re seeing so far?"
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,I know that’s been a major concern—you’ve talked about at this press conference and others.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,So many people have had that bridge across the pandemic.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, we talked about that at the beginning."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"For many people, it’s clear that they’ve made it across, and their job is okay, and their house is okay."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, it’s been terribly inconvenient and painful, and schools are closed and things like that."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"But there, there’s a bunch of people yet who haven’t found that bridge yet."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we’re, we’re very focused on that."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we’re, we’re very, very focused on that group of people with our policy and, and, and, you know, the way we look at the economy."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"Of course, the other thing is, we’re going to a different economy."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, clearly, we’re, we’re learning that things can be done from remote locations."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,We’re learning that technology can replace people even more than we thought.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,And some of that is happening.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I think as we, you know, as we get into this, you know, the phase after—even after the economy fully reopens, I think we’re still going to need to keep people in mind whose lives have been disrupted, because they’ve lost that—the work that they did."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I think it would be wise as a country, for the longer-run productive capacity of the country, if we were to look out for those people and help them find their way back into the labor force even if it means continuing support for an additional period of time."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,CHRISTOPHER RUGABER.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,And we’re going to be learning more about that as we go.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,Do you feel that structural impacts have been—how would you characterize those?
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,So those people are still at risk.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s not easy to change careers completely midcareer.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,Do we see longer-term damage to the job market?
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,Have—or has there been some success in preventing that?
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, compared to previous recessions, how would you characterize the damage to the job market here, in terms of things like, you know, permanent job loss, workers that need to shift industries, that kind of thing?"
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, the, the, the big thing is that the jury’s out."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"And this has been a concern since the very beginning, is the concern that people—if, if they become disconnected from the industry or the job where—that they used to work in, it, it can be years or never when they get back into the labor force, particularly for people who are well along in their careers—the same kind of scarring for small businesses, which don’t have the kind of resources that you need to get through this."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"So that just, again, stresses the urgency that we feel and others feel at, at, you know, fully defeating the pandemic, finishing the job and getting back to a place where it’s safe to have these—you know, to, to, to stay in hotels, to fly on airplanes, to go to sporting events and movie theaters, and all of those things."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we’ve, we’ve had a big concern about, about both of those."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,And that’s a good thing.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"But as I said that, you know, the jury is out here—9 or 10 million people still out of work because of the pandemic."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,They’re—a big chunk of them are people who worked in public-facing jobs in the service sector.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, they’ve gotten a lot of support from fiscal policy and some from monetary policy."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,But the question is getting them back to work.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, it’s, it’s harder if you’re—it takes longer, empirically, to find that next job if you’re looking at a brand-new industry."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,We haven’t seen as much of it as we—as we feared.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"And that’s, that’s what we’re going to do."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,There was a lot of pent-up demand.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"In fact, we learned a lot from that experience."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, all of that said, the judgment on how much to spend and in what way is really one for Congress and the Administration and not for the Fed."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,And the path ahead is still pretty uncertain.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"Many small businesses are under pressure, and there are other needs to be addressed."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s as many people as lost their jobs at the peak of the Global Financial Crisis and the Great Recession.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,Something like 9 million people remain unemployed as a consequence of the pandemic.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"I would—I would add that we’re, as I mentioned, a long way from a full recovery."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"When we look back on, on the history of this period, we’ll see a strong and sustained fiscal policy response."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,Fiscal policy has been absolutely essential.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,And that’s really a key reason why the recovery has been as strong as it’s been.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I guess I’d start by saying that the, the fiscal response that we’ve seen to this downturn has been strong, and I think we can say now that it’s been sustained after the passage of the—of the, the most recent act in, in late December."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,And in what areas?
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,Do you believe the economy still needs additional support on the fiscal side?
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,We have a weakening short-term outlook.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"We have— now have a new, new President, a new Congress."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"Last year you consistently said that the economy needed more fiscal support and, I believe, were pleased when the $900 billion package was approved in December."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,And we think it’s a good approach because—for us to use ones that are always-on—because we don’t really think we’d be successful in every case in picking the exact right time to intervene in markets.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,So that’s for banks.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"You really asked about nonbanks, the nonbank sector."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,And so we monitor financial conditions very broadly.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"And while we don’t have jurisdiction over, over many areas in the nonbank sector, other agencies do."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"And so we do coordinate through the Financial Stability Oversight Council and with other agencies who have responsibility for, for nonbank supervision."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,And these discussions are going on right now.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, in fact, as you know, in the last crisis, the banking system held up fairly well so far."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"So that’s—right now we are engaged in, in carefully examining, understanding, and thinking about what, what in the nonbank sector will need to be addressed in the next year or so."

2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"James Politi, FT. JAMES POLITI."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you so much, Michelle and Chair Powell."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,I had a question on fiscal policy.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, and the dislocations that we saw from the outsized economic and financial shock of the pandemic really appeared in the nonbank sector."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"So there’s a discussion, as you know, right now around, around those precise questions, and, and that’s appropriate, but not for us to play a role in talking about specific policies."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,We look at—and we made that framework public after the financial crisis so that it could be criticized and understood and we could be held accountable.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, the things that we look at are—we do look at asset prices."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,We also look at leverage in the banking system.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"We look at leverage in the non—the nonbanking system, which is to say, corporates and households."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,And we look at also funding risk.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"And if you look at it across that range of, of, of readings, they’re each different, but we monitor them carefully."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,We don’t look at one thing or two things.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,And I would say that financial stability vulnerabilities overall are moderate.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"And that includes not just the banks, but money market funds and, and all different kinds of nonbank financial structures as well."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"So when we get to the nonfinancial sector, we don’t—we don’t have jurisdiction over that."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"But—so I would just say that our—that there are many things that go in, as you know, to, to setting asset prices."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"So if you look at what’s really been driving asset prices, really, in the last couple of months, it isn’t monetary policy."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s been expectations about vaccines.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"And it’s also financial—sorry, fiscal policy."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"Our overall goal is to assure that the financial system itself is resilient to, to shocks of all kinds, that it’s strong and resilient."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,We don’t use time-varying tests and tools as some other countries do.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, on, on matters of financial stability, we have a framework."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,Our role assigned by Congress is maximum employment and stable prices and also look after financial stability.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,Steve Liesman.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,STEVE LIESMAN.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,I wonder if I could follow up on Jeanna’s question here.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"I understand that you do address issues of, of valuations through macroprudential policies in the first instance, but there’s a range of assets."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,And I know you do watch a range of assets.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, in a world where, almost a year later, we’re, we’re still 9 million jobs, at least—that’s one way of counting it; it can actually be counted much higher than that— short of maximum employment and people are out of the labor force who were in the labor force—the real unemployment rate is close to 10 percent if you include people that’ve left the labor force—it’s very much appropriate that monetary policy be highly accommodative to support maximum employment and price stability, which is getting inflation back to 2 percent and averaging 2 percent over time."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"But from Bitcoin to corporate bonds to the stock market in general to some of these more specific meteoric rises in stocks like GameStop, how do you address the concern that super easy monetary policy—asset purchases and zero interest rates—are potentially fueling a bubble that could cause economic fallout should it burst?"
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,Let me—let me provide a little context.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,The shock that the—from the pandemic was unprecedented both in its nature and in its size and in the amount of unemployment that it created and in the shock to economic activity.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,There’s nothing close to it in our modern economic history.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,So our response was really to that.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we—we’ve done what we could, first, to restore market function and to provide a bit of relief, then to support the recovery."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, hopefully, we’ll be able to do the third thing, which is to avoid longer-run damage to the—to the economy."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"In terms of macroprudential policy tools, so, as you know, no doubt, we rely on sort of always-on, through-the-cycle macroprudential policy tools, particularly the stress tests and also the elevated levels of liquidity and capital and, and, and also resolution planning that we—that we impose on the largest financial institutions."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s just not really something that I would typically comment on.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, on, on your first question, I don’t want to comment on a particular company or, or day’s market activity or things like that."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"Employment fell by 140,000 in December, as continued gains in many industries were outweighed by significant losses in industries where the resurgence of the virus has weighed further on activity."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"In particular, the leisure and hospitality sector lost nearly half a million jobs, largely from restaurants and bars."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"The unemployment rate remained elevated at 6.7 percent in December, and participation in the labor market is notably below pre-pandemic levels."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"Although there has been much progress in the labor market since the spring, millions of Americans remain out of work."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"The economic downturn has not fallen equally on all Americans, and those least able to shoulder the burden have been the hardest hit."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"In particular, the high level of joblessness has been especially severe for lower-wage workers in the service sector and for African Americans and Hispanics."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"As with overall economic activity, the pace of improvement in the labor market has slowed in recent months."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,The economic dislocation has upended many lives and created great uncertainty about the future.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"Following large declines in the spring, consumer prices picked up over the summer but have leveled out more recently."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"For those sectors that have been most adversely affected by the pandemic, prices remain particularly soft."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"Overall, on a 12-month basis, inflation remains below our 2 percent longer-run objective."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"While we should not underestimate the challenges we currently face, several developments point to an improved outlook for later this year."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,Sufficiently widespread vaccinations would enable us to put the pandemic behind us and return to more normal economic activities.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"In the meantime, continued observance of social-distancing measures and wearing masks will help us reach that goal as soon as possible."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,The pandemic has also left a significant imprint on inflation.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,Support from fiscal policy will help households and businesses weather the downturn as well as limit lasting damage to the economy that could otherwise impede the recovery.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"Overall economic activity remains below its level before the pandemic, and the path ahead remains highly uncertain."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"The overall recovery in economic activity since last spring is due in part to federal stimulus payments and expanded unemployment benefits, which have provided essential support to many families and individuals."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, we, we understand—as we understood then, but even more so—we understand that the—that the way to do it is to communicate well in advance, to, to do predictable things, and to move gradually."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"Transcript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference January 27, 2021 CHAIR POWELL."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,Good afternoon.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"At the Federal Reserve, we are strongly committed to achieving the monetary policy goals that Congress has given us: maximum employment and price stability."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"Since the beginning of the pandemic, we have taken forceful actions to provide relief and stability, to ensure that the recovery will be as strong as possible, and to limit lasting damage to the economy."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,Today my colleagues on the FOMC and I kept interest rates near zero and maintained our sizable asset purchases.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"The recently enacted Coronavirus Response and Relief Act [Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021] will provide additional support."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"These measures, along with our strong guidance on interest rates and our balance sheet, will ensure that monetary policy will continue to deliver powerful support to the economy until the recovery is complete."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"A resurgence in recent months in COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths is causing great hardship for millions of Americans and is weighing on economic activity and job creation."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"Following a sharp rebound in economic activity last summer, the pace of the recovery has moderated in recent months, with the weakness concentrated in the sectors of the economy most adversely affected by the resurgence of the virus and by greater social distancing."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"Household spending on services remains low, especially in sectors that typically require people to gather closely, including travel and hospitality."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,And household spending on goods has moderated following earlier large gains.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"In contrast, the housing sector has more than fully recovered from the downturn, supported in part by low mortgage interest rates."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,Business investment and manufacturing production have also picked up.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,The path of the economy continues to depend significantly on the course of the virus.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"Those are—those are the news items that have been driving, driving asset purchases—sorry, asset values in, in recent months."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"In addition, as we have seen since last summer, the economy has proved more resilient than expected, in part reflecting the adaptability of households and businesses."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"The Fed’s response to this crisis has been guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people, along with our responsibilities to promote the stability of the financial system."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,I look forward to your questions.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,JEANNA SMIALEK.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Chair Powell."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,Jeanna Smialek from the New York Times.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you for taking our questions.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"And then, secondarily, you and your colleagues have repeatedly made it clear that you really plan to use macroprudential tools as the first line of defense when it comes to financial stability risks."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,But your macroprudential tools primarily apply to the banks.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"I’m wondering what your plan is, if you see some sort of large financial stability risk emanating from the nonbank financial sector in the coming months, especially as it relates to search-for-yield kind of activities."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, what, what do you see as the solution there?"
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,I was hoping that you would first react to the wild ride that game stock—GameStop’s stock has had this week.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"Finally, monetary policy is playing a key role in supporting the recovery and will continue to do so."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,We are committed to using our full range of tools to support the economy and to help assure that the recovery from this difficult period will be as robust as possible.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"To conclude, we understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"Today we unanimously reaffirmed our Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, as we typically do each January."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"As we say in that statement, we view maximum employment as a “broad-based and inclusive goal.” Our ability to achieve maximum employment in the years ahead depends importantly on having longer-term inflation expectations well anchored at 2 percent."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"As the Committee reiterated in today’s policy statement, with inflation running persistently below 2 percent, we will aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time so that inflation averages 2 percent over time and longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2 percent."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,We expect to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until these employment and inflation outcomes are achieved.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"With regard to interest rates, we continue to expect it will be appropriate to maintain the current 0 to ¼ percent target range for the federal funds rate until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee’s assessment of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"In addition, we will continue to increase our holdings of Treasury securities by at least $80 billion per month and of agency mortgage-backed securities by at least $40 billion per month until substantial further progress has been made toward our maximum-employment and price-stability goals."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,Everything we do is in service to our public mission.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,The increase in our balance sheet since last March has materially eased financial conditions and is providing substantial support to the economy.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"Our forward guidance for the federal funds rate, along with our balance sheet guidance, will ensure that the stance of monetary policy remains highly accommodative as the recovery progresses."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,Our guidance is outcome based and ties the path of the federal funds rate and the balance sheet to progress toward reaching our employment and inflation goals.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thus, if progress toward our goals were to slow, the guidance would convey our intention to increase policy accommodation through a lower expected path of the federal funds rate and a higher expected path of the balance sheet."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"Overall, our interest rate and balance sheet tools are providing powerful support to the economy and will continue to do so."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’ve also taken actions to more directly support the flow of credit in the economy, deploying our emergency lending powers to an unprecedented extent, enabled in large part by financial backing and support from Congress and the Treasury."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"Although the CARES Act facilities are no—are no longer open to new activity, our other facilities remain in place."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"The economy is a long way from our employment and inflation goals, and it is likely to take some time for substantial further progress to be achieved."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I, I know that monetary policy does play a role there, but that’s how we look at it."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,Jeanna Smialek.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,STEVE LIESMAN.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,Michael McKee.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHAEL MCKEE.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"A question—I have a question that I was going to ask, but I need to follow up for a second on the questions about the markets and macroprudential, and that is, you have one tool you can use."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,Would you be discussing—have you discussed raising margin requirements under Regulation T?
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, if not, why not?"
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"No, we haven’t—we haven’t done that."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, and that—that’s not, you know—over the years, we, we consult the fact that we have that authority."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, no, it’s not something we’re looking at right now at all."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHAEL MCKEE.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,All right.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"My follow-up question is, a lot of people in the markets think that you’re basically stuck right now, because you can’t really go lower with the zero bound, rejecting negative interest rates, and you can’t really go higher because of the threat of a taper tantrum."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,Is the Fed locked into a very narrow corridor now?
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mean, remember, we’re, we’re focused on maximum employment, price stability, financial stability as I defined it—the broad financial sector."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, if not, you did say you would signal any change in interest rates a long time ahead."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"I, I have been vaccinated once, and I expect to get my second vaccine sometime soon."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, we can have a base case, but we realize no one knows how the—how this new vaccine will roll out, how successful it will be, how high we’ll be able to drive vaccination, and those sorts of things."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we have a base case, and we—but we always—we always look at, at the range of possibilities."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"In this case, we particularly look at the downside risks."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, that’s really what we do is, we, we set policies so that we’re, we’re, you know, we’re going to remain accommodative until we actually see improvement in the economy and not just in the outlook, in the data."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"So that’s, that’s how we think about, about that."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I would—I would also add, there’s nothing more important to the economy now than, than people getting vaccinated."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, if you—if you, you think about the places where the economy is weak—I mentioned bars and restaurants."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"Many other areas of the economy— actually, there was actually job creation in—you know, in goods production and in some service parts—industries as well."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,But we’re just not going to be able to get that last group of people back to work—and it’s a big group of people—until we get the pandemic behind us.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"We, we have not won this yet."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"We haven’t succeeded in doing this yet, and we need to stay focused on it as a country and, and get there."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, we clearly can, but we’re going to have to stay focused."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"And that includes—you know, that includes us at the Fed, monetary policy."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"That’s 400,000 jobs we lost last month, and that’s all because of the spread of the pandemic."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,We don’t know how to—we don’t know how to model that.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,But [former] New York Fed President Bill Dudley says there’s no way you can avoid a taper tantrum.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s just too early to be talking about dates, which we should be focused on, on progress."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,We’ll need to see actual progress.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"And when, when we see ourselves getting to that point, we’ll communicate clearly about it to, to the public so nobody will be surprised when the time comes."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,And we’ll do that well in advance of actually considering what will be a pretty gradual taper.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHAEL MCKEE.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"Well, if I might, you—your policies are working, and you can maybe do more."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"We said we’d want to see substantial further progress toward our goals before we modify our, our asset purchase guidance."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"But the question is, can you stop doing it when it’s time?"
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,Yes.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, you know, I, I was here—we had all the same questions back in—after the Global Financial Crisis."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,We raised interest rates.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"We froze the balance sheet size, and then we shrank the balance sheet size."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"So there’s no reason why we, we won’t be able to do that again."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I think, you know, I think that the connection between low interest rates and, and asset values is probably something that’s not as tight as people think, because a lot of—a lot of different factors are driving asset prices at any given time."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,So how do you do that?
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"We just created the, the guidance."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"We certainly have things that we can do, but we think we’re—we think we’re in the right place."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"Well, first, I—we, we think our policy stance is, is just right."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,We think it’s providing significant support for economic activity and hiring.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"In September, we, we implemented rate guidance that, that was consistent with and based on that new framework."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"In December, we did the same for asset purchases."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we now have, you know, strong guidance on, on rates and on asset purchases that’s providing very strong support for economic activity."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"If you look at the sectors of the economy that are interest sensitive, you will see very strong activity: housing, durable goods, automobile sales."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, in terms of—in terms of tapering, it’s just premature."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, you know, our, our policies are working."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"That said, there’s clearly more that we can do."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"With asset purchases, for example, we can, you know—that’s, that’s a tool we can do more—we can strengthen our guidance, too, if we were to think that that were appropriate."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"What you see is an economy where what’s holding it back is not the lack of, of policy support from the Fed."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s the pandemic.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s, it’s the spread of the disease and people’s reluctance or, or inability to partake in certain kinds of economic activities, which amount to a, a meaningful part of the economy."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"So that’s, that’s what I would say."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we think that, that they are—we think our policy stance is, is right."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,The other—another reason why is just the arrival of these new virus strains.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"We, you know, we, we adopted a new monetary policy framework of flexible average inflation targeting in August."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"You’ll notice that we, we said that the, the pandemic still, still provides considerable downside risks to the economy."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,Michael Derby.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHAEL DERBY.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,Yes.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you very much.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"I wanted to ask you, if there is a near- term rise in inflation related to the recovery, how will you determine whether or not it’s something that’s temporary or more enduring?"
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,And how much inflation is the Fed willing to tolerate before it acts to restrain price pressures?

2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,One is just that we know that we measure inflation on a trailing 12-month basis.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"And as we—as we lap the very low inflation readings of March and April of last year, we’ll see measured 12-month inflation move up a few tenths."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"This is just—they’re called base effects, and, and that’s a—that’s a transient thing that we think will pass."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"There’s also the possibility—indeed, it’s in some forecasts—that as the economy fully reopens, there’ll be a burst of spending, and—because people will be enthusiastic that the pandemic is over, potentially, and that that could also create some upward pressure on inflation."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"Now, again, we would see that as something likely to be transient and not to be very large."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"In both cases, we don’t see those as either lasting or particularly large."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, on inflation, a couple of things—there are a couple of things that are worth mentioning."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"So the way we would react is, we’re going to be patient."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,We would rely on macroprudential and other tools to deal with financial stability issues.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"Can I follow up, Michelle, if you don’t mind?"
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"And that’s one of the reasons why, is that—is the slowness of the rollout."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"Mr. Chairman, do you rule out or see as one of your tools in the toolkit the idea of adjusting monetary policy to address asset values?"
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, you know, that’s—as you know, that’s one of the very difficult questions in all of monetary policy."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we don’t rule it out as a theoretical matter, but we, we clearly look to macroprudential tools, regulatory tools, supervisory tools, other kinds of tools rather than monetary policy in, in addressing financial stability issues."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,STEVE LIESMAN.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s not—you know, the, the monetary policy we know strengthens economic activity and job creation through fairly well- understood channels."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"That will mean strong, you know, well-capitalized institutions, and, and households will be— will be working."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, and so we know that."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"We don’t actually understand the tradeoff between—the sense of it is, would you—if you raise interest rates and thereby tighten financial conditions and reduce economic activity now in order to address asset bubbles and things like that, what—will that even help?"
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"Will it—will it actually cause more damage, or will it help?"
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,So I think that’s unresolved.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I, I think it’s, it’s something we, we look at as not, not theoretically ruled out but not something we, we—we’ve ever done and not something we would plan to do."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,And a strong economy is actually a great supporter of financial stability.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,Expect us to wait and see and not react if we see small and what we would review—we would view as very likely to be transient effects on inflation.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,Inflation has averaged less than 2 percent for a quarter of a century.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,Rachel Siegel.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,RACHEL SIEGEL.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,I have a two-pronged question about vaccines.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"So you specifically mentioned progress in the rollout of vaccines, but there is still plenty that we don’t know about supply over the coming weeks and months."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,And so that’s what we’re planning on doing.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,So I’m curious how you and your colleagues are factoring in vaccine rollouts and funding for distribution in your forecasts and what that timeline looks like.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, in terms of the rollout of the vaccines, we see what everyone else sees, right?"
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think if you—you know, it helps to look back at, at the inflation dynamics that the United States has had now for some decades and notice that there has been, you know, significant disinflationary pressure for some time, for a couple of decades."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"We see that we’re, we’re vaccinating people and at a rate of about a million a day, apparently, and that it’ll take quite a while to get—to get to the numbers that the experts say are required to get to herd immunity."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,And we think it’s going to be a struggle.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"And then, secondly, I’m wondering if you, yourself haven’t—has been—have been vaccinated, along with other FOMC members."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"The, the way to achieve credibility on that is to actually do it."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you, Michelle, and thank you, Chair Powell, for taking our questions."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, again, we’ll seek inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"We understand that inflation dynamics evolve constantly over time, but they don’t change rapidly."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we’ll, we’ll show what that means when we get inflation above 2 percent."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we think it’s very unlikely that anything we see now would result in, you know, troubling inflation."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"Of course, if we did get sustained inflation at a level that was uncomfortable, we have tools for that."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s far harder to deal with, with too low inflation."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"Those things, they change over time."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,And we don’t expect to see that at all.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"In terms of how much, you know, what we’ve said is we’d like to see—because inflation has been running persistently below 2 percent, we’d like to see it run moderately above 2 percent for some time."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"We know what to do with higher inflation, which is, you know, should the need arise, we, we would have those tools."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,We have not adopted a formula.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,We’re not going to adopt a formula.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’re going to—we, we use policy rules and formulas in everything we do, consult them constantly, but we don’t set policy by them."
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,We don’t do that.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,And so we’re going to preserve an element of judgment.
2021-01-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"And the inflation dynamics, with the flat Phillips curve and low persistence of inflation, is very much intact."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"So that’s, that’s a—sort of a broader, detailed look."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,Michael McKee.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"So a very high priority for us as regulators and supervisors is going to be to go back—and this, this will involve all the other regulatory agencies; it does involve all of them as well—and see if we can strengthen those things."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHAEL MCKEE.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"Mr. Chairman, can you help me understand something about the, the SEP and your forecasts?"
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"The inflation that you’re talking about for this year, you say, is “transitory.” Then, by 2023, you’re back down to 2.1 percent."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"Well, again, I wouldn’t read too much into, into the, the March 2021 SEP dot plot."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"If you get to 3½ percent unemployment but inflation is only at 2 or 2.1 percent, are you willing to leave rates at zero going forward from there—or, roughly zero going forward from there?"
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"In other words, could we be in a Japan-like situation where rates just stay low because inflation does?"
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,Remember what it is: It’s a compilation of individual projections by individual members.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"Some have more optimistic ones, some less optimistic."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,And we need to go back and look at that.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,They’re all making different assessments.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"They, they have different forecasts, economic forecasts."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,There’s no forecast for a rate increase for 2023.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"But we, we don’t—we don’t feel like we can let the moment pass without just saying again that we—that those—some aspects of the short-term funding markets and, more broadly, nonbank financial intermediation didn’t hold up so well under great stress—under tremendous stress."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,And I’ll just quickly touch on them.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,And they’ve been quiet since the spring.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s a framework that we, we have."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,And they’re—also remember that the SEP doesn’t actually include all the things that go into maximum employment.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s not a particular market or a particular asset or anything like that.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"We report on it semiannually, the Board gets a report on it quarterly, and we monitor every day."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"And it has—it has four pillars, and those are four key vulnerabilities: asset valuations, debt owed by businesses and households, funding risk, and leverage among financial institutions."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,Those four things.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"So if you look at asset valuations, you can say that by some measures, some asset valuations are elevated compared to history."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,I think that’s clear.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, we shut down our facilities and all of that."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"In terms of households and businesses, households entered the, the crisis in very good shape by historical standards."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"Now, there was—there was some negative effects on that, people lost their jobs and that sort of thing, but they’ve also gotten a lot of support now."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"So the damage hasn’t been as, as bad as we thought."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"Businesses, by the same token, had a high debt load coming in."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,And—but—and many saw their revenues decline.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"But there’s—they’ve done so much financing, and there’s a lot of cash on their balance sheet."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,So nothing in those two sectors really jumps out as really troubling.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,Short term—I mentioned funding risk as the—as the last one.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we saw, again, in this crisis, breakdowns in parts of the short-term funding markets—came under a tremendous amount of stress."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,Leverage in the household sector had been just kind of gradually moving down and down and down since the—since the financial crisis.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,Right?
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,Now we do.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I, I would just say, we’ve set out clear guidance."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, the things that have tended to really hurt an economy and have in recent history hurt the U.S., we didn’t see them build up despite very low rates."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"Part of that just is that you’re in a low- rate environment, you’re in a much lower rate environment, and the connection between low rates and the kind of financial instability issues is just not as tight as people think it is."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s not to say we ignore it.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,We don’t ignore it.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"We, we watch it very carefully."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,And we don’t think—we think there is a connection.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"We say there is, but it’s not quite so clear."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"We actually monitor financial conditions very, very broadly and carefully."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,And we didn’t do that before the Global Financial Crisis 12 years ago.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we’ve also, you know, put a lot of time and effort into strengthening the large financial institutions that form the core of our financial system—are much stronger, much more resilient."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s true of the banks.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,I think it’s true of the CCPs.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"We want it to be true of, of other nonbank financial intermediation, markets, and, and institutions."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I think that’s, that’s—you know, monetary policy should be, to me, for, for achieving our macroeconomic aims."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"Financial regulatory policy and supervision should be for strengthening the financial system so that it is strong and robust and can withstand the kinds of things that it couldn’t, frankly—and we learned that in 2008, ’09, ’10."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s not one thing.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"This time around, the regulated part of the financial system held up very well."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,We didn’t see the things you—we didn’t see a housing bubble.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,We didn’t see asset prices form into bubbles that would threaten the progress of the economy.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"During that, we didn’t see, actually, excess buildup of debt."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"I, I would point out that, over the long expansion—the longest in U.S. history, 10 years and 8 months—rates were very low for—they were at zero for, you know, 7 years and then—and then never got above, you know, 2.4 percent, roughly."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"The—the message from the SEP that I would like to leave with people is, we set out clear guidance."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,I mentioned what it was.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s inflation up to—no, sorry, it’s, it’s labor market conditions consistent with our estimates of maximum employment—and that’s not just unemployment, it’s all the other indicators, but, overall, totaling up to maximum employment; it’s inflation at 2 percent, and not on a transient basis; and inflation on track to exceed 2 percent for—moderately for some time."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,Those are the criteria.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,We’re committed to robustly implementing that guidance.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,And that’s what this—that’s what this says.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s really all it says.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,We’re going to wait until those requirements are met.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s, it’s only—it only includes unemployment."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, again, you know, the, the state of the economy in two or three years is highly uncertain."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHAEL MCKEE.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"If I could follow up, I’m just wondering—before 2019, I would say you were focused on the problems with having interest rates too low."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,Now are you saying we’re willing to live with it until we reach these goals even if you get—meet your goal on maximum employment?
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"So what I would say is, we’re committed to giving the economy the support that it needs to return as quickly as possible to a state of maximum employment and price stability."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, to the extent having rates low and support for monetary policy broadly, to the extent that raises other questions, we think it’s absolutely essential to maintain the strength and stability of the—of the broader financial system and to carefully monitor financial stability questions if that’s what you’re getting at."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, we, we do that."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,We will—we monitor them very carefully.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,And I wouldn’t want to focus too much on the exact timing of a potential rate increase that far into the future.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, as you know, financial stability for us is, is a framework."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"And the December stress tests showed that banks are strong and well capitalized under our hypothetical recessions that we—that we used in December, which were quite stringent."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thanks, Chair Powell, for taking these questions."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,You laid out the standards to lift off.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"And back in June of 2020, you said, you know, you’re not even thinking about thinking about raising rates."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,But I see seven members seeing liftoff in 2023 and 4 next year.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"How, how much debate—and how can you characterize that conversation—has there been about moving off the lower bound earlier than signaled?"
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"Well, you know, it all depends."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’ve set out very clear criteria for liftoff, right, where we’ve said we want to see labor market conditions that are consistent with our estimates of, of maximum employment."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"And that doesn’t just mean unemployment, it means a much broader set of criteria."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"We want inflation at 2 percent, and not on a transitory basis."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,And we want inflation on track to be moderately—to run moderately above 2 percent for some time.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,Those are the three conditions.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"Everybody on the Committee agrees to that, right?"
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"So it comes down to, what’s your projection for the economy?"
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"If you want to—if you want to—you know, people will have a range of, of assessments for how good the economy is going to be."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, we, we don’t—I would say that we’re in a relatively highly uncertain situation."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"If you look at the uncertainty, people, people on the Committee broadly say that uncertainty about the forecast is, is very high compared to the normal level."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,EDWARD LAWRENCE.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,Edward Lawrence.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"We, we found some other areas that need strengthening, and that’s what we’re working on now."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,Hannah Lang.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,HANNAH LANG.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, thanks so much for taking our questions."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"I wanted to ask if the Fed is planning on extending the same restrictions on bank dividends and share repurchases— I’m sorry, share repurchases that are currently in place into the second quarter, and if you’re considering at all the scenario analysis and midcycle stress tests that were in place last year, this year."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, kind of, what would make you consider doing something like that again?"
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,We haven’t come out of a pandemic before.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,We’re a couple weeks away from announcing that decision.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"I, I won’t foreshadow it here today."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"I will say, we’re going to continue our data-driven approach."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know that we restricted buybacks and dividends, so the firms are preserving capital."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"Through 2020, the banks actually increased their level of capital and their level of reserves."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’re right in the middle of our 2021 stress tests, and we’ll release those results before the end of June."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"And that layers, you know, very significant additional stress on top of the stress the banks have already absorbed over the past year, with the unemployment rate going to 11 percent and stock prices falling more than 50 percent."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"So—but all of that, you know, the results of the stress tests and the decision on distributions—all of that is to come fairly soon, as I mentioned."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,So we haven’t made a decision on that.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"We haven’t had this kind of fiscal support before, totaling it all up."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"So you’re going to have different perspectives from Committee participants about how fast growth will be, how fast the labor market will heal, or how fast—sorry, inflation will move up."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,And those things are going to dictate where people write down an estimate of liftoff.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"Do you still, I guess, maybe see the country in a place right now where it wouldn’t be a concern if there were to be more spending at this time?"
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, Brian, it’s not up to us to decide what, what Congress should spend money on or when."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"I was answering Jeanna’s question, which really was, how do we assure lack of damage to—scarring, for example, or lack of damage to the productive capacity of the economy?"
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,And I think what’s happened so far has done a pretty good job of that.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, really, I wanted to make the longer-run point that if—to work on the productivity—on productivity over longer periods, that is—that is—comes down to a number of things."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"But one of those things is investment: investment in people, in their skills, education, aptitude, all of those things."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,I’m not in any way suggesting that that’s something Congress should work on right now.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,So where do you see the fiscal space right now?
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"Or that, you know, that’s just not my—that’s not our job."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,Those things are completely tools that Congress has.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, again, I wasn’t making a comment at all on the current fiscal setting."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,Next to Michael Derby.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHAEL DERBY.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you for taking my question.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"I just wanted to get your—an updated view on your sense of your view on financial stability risks and whether or not you see any pockets of excess out in financial markets that concern you, either, you know, specifically to that, that area of the market or as in terms of, like, the threat that it could pose to—propose to the overall economy."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"I’m just saying, that, that is what fiscal policy can do that, really, monetary policy can’t do—is, is invest in the future productive capacity of the economy, raise potential growth."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,Sure.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,So we just had $1.9 trillion dollars in spending.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,I wanted to elaborate a little bit on your commentary about the fiscal stimulus.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"Of course, this isn’t a decision to lift off now."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,We’ll make that decision then.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,But it’s an estimate based on—based on assumptions about growth.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"And it’s, it’s meant to be a tool to generally show the public how, how our objective function works, how we think about the future."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,It isn’t meant to actually pin down a time when we might or might not lift off.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"We—you know, we’re not going to make that decision for some time."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,The chances are that the economy in that time and place will be very different from the one we think it’ll be.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I—sometimes with the dots, I have to be sure to point out that they—they’re not a Committee forecast."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"So it sounds like you, I guess, see the case for even maybe more investment, at least from Congress, to support the more productive economy, as you answered to Jeanna’s question."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"And you know this, but it’s—they’re not a Committee forecast."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,We think it serves a useful purpose.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s not meant to, to actually be a promise or even a prediction of when the Committee will act."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"That will be very much dependent on economic outcomes, which are highly uncertain."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,We’ll go to Brian Cheung.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,BRIAN CHEUNG.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hey there, Chairman Powell."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s just compiling these projections, really, of individual people."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,SCOTT HORSLEY.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"Anneken, CNN."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"That part of the economy—and travel and hotels—that part of the economy is, is really not functioning at, at full capacity, right?"
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"But as that happens, people can start to spend."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s also—wouldn’t be surprising if—and you’re seeing this now, particularly in the goods economy—there’ll be bottlenecks."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"They won’t be—they won’t be able to service all of the demand maybe, maybe for a period."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"So those things could lead to—and we’ve, we’ve modeled that."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,Other people have too.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,We’ve—and what we see is relatively modest increases in inflation.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,So—but those are not permanent things.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, what’ll, what’ll happen is—the supply side—the supply side in the United States is very dynamic."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"People start businesses, they, they reopen restaurants, you know, the airlines are, will be flying again, all of those things will happen."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"And so it’ll turn out to be a one—a one-time sort of bulge in, in prices, but it won’t change inflation going forward, because inflation expectations are strongly anchored around 2 percent."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,We know that inflation dynamics do evolve over time.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"And there was a time when, when inflation went up, it would stay up."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, and that time is not now."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,That hasn’t been the case for some decades.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,And we think it won’t—it won’t—we won’t suddenly change to another regime.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,These things tend to change over time.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"They’re not going to restaurants, not going to theaters."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,And so— and they’re not doing that now.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"Past that, as the economy reopens, people will start spending more, and then, you know, you can only go out to dinner once per night, but a lot of people can go out to dinner."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’ll wear off quickly, though, because it—just the way the numbers are calculated."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Chair Powell."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"As you know, households, households are sitting on a lot of excess savings."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I wonder if, combined with that, you have an unleashing of, you know, pent-up demand."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,How much do you think that would affect—that would affect inflation?
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,And would you expect that to be transitory?
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"We, you know, we and everyone who’s forecasting these—what, what we’re all doing is, we are looking at the—at the amount of savings."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’re looking at—you know, we have reasonably good data on that."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,And they tend to—tend to change when the central bank doesn’t understand that having inflation expectations anchored at 2 percent is the key to it all.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,And we’re looking at the government transfers that’ll be made as part of the various laws.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"And from that, you can develop an estimate of the impact on spending, on growth, on hiring, and, ultimately, on inflation."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"So that’s, that’s what we’re all doing."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we have, you know, we have—we can look at history, and we can make estimates, and those are all very transparent and public."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,And you can compare one to the other.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, of course, we’ve all—we’ve all done that."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,And I think we’ve made very conservative assumptions and sensible mainstream assumptions at each step of that process.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"And what, what it comes down to is what I said before, which is, there very likely will be a step-up in inflation as March and April of last year drop out of the 12-month window, because they were very low inflation numbers."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s a—that’ll be a fairly significant pop in inflation.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we’re trying to make an assessment on what will be the tendency of people to spend that money, the marginal propensity to consume."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,DON LEE.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"The, the—having them anchored at 2 percent is what gives us the ability to push hard when the economy’s really weak."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’re committed to having inflation expectations anchored at 2 percent, not materially above or below 2 percent."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, the, the really strong economic data is coming."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"It should be coming, assuming we stay on this track."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"And that’s when you’ll really know where, where the bottlenecks are."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"But you can see, though, that they’re not—these are not permanent."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s not like the supply side will be unable to adapt to these things.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,It will—the market will clear.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,It just may take some time.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, and some of the answer to that may be price."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"In many cases, it won’t be price."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,You’ll see that people are reluctant to raise prices.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, it’s a little bit the story about, you know, the wage—the wage Phillips curve does show that as unemployment goes down, wages move up."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"So you’ll see a lot of that here too, I think."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"Anyway, we’ll, we’ll see."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"But that’s, that’s my basic, basic sense."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you very much.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"Vaccination is moving, now, quickly."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,COVID cases are coming down.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"And that’ll, that’ll add to spending."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, you’re, you’re—right now the, the checks are going out just, just now."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"So that’s—I think if you—if you look at the savings, look at all of that, model it, that’s, that’s kind of what comes out of our assessment."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,There are different possibilities.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think it’s, it’s a relatively unusual—very unusual situation to have all these savings and this, this amount of fiscal support and monetary policy support."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"Nonetheless, that, that is our most likely case."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"And you know, as the—as the data come in and the economy performs, we’ll of course adjust."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"Our outcome-based guidance will immediately adapt, we think, to meet whatever the actual path of the economy is."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"If we saw inflation expectations moving materially above 2 percent, of course, we would conduct policy in a way that would, would make sure that that didn’t happen."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,We’ll go to Scott Horsley for the last question.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thanks, Chairman Powell."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"My question is about those supply chain bottlenecks, especially on the goods side."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"Are they getting better, or are they getting worse?"
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,We saw they were sort of a drag on the industrial production numbers we—that came out yesterday.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"And what do you expect them to do to prices in, in—just in the short run?"
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, I have to say, I think it’s impossible to say, frankly, with any confidence, but I, I would expect it’s very possible—let’s put it that way—that you will see bottlenecks emerge and then clear over time."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"And you’ll probably see that over a period of time, because, you know, really, the, the strong data are ahead of us."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s all ahead of us, but the data should, should get stronger fairly quickly here and remain strong for some time here."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"Don Lee, L.A. Times."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,Okay.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,ANNEKEN TAPPE.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,If they offset each other—the persistent pandemic unemployment.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"Yes, I think I’m hearing you correctly."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,So I would say a couple things.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,There was a time when there was a tight connection between unemployment and inflation.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,That time is long gone.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"We had extremely low unemployment in, in—not extremely low."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,We had low unemployment in 2018 and ’19 and the beginning of ’20 without having troubling inflation at all.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,We were at 3.5 percent.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,We were bouncing around with unemployment 3.5 percent to 4 percent.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,And it wasn’t just unemployment.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"Participation was high, wages were moving up."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,It was a very healthy thing.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,And we didn’t see price inflation move up.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,There is a relationship between wage inflation and unemployment.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"Yes, exactly."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,ANNEKEN TAPPE.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,Is that—is that the question?
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,ANNEKEN TAPPE.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks for taking my question.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"Chairman Powell, could you talk to us a little bit about the relationship between the persistent pandemic unemployment and the expected increase in, in inflation?"
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,Does the former offset the latter to some degree?
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"I’m sorry, could you repeat that?"
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,You broke up there for a second.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,ANNEKEN TAPPE.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"But that has not— what, what happens is that when wages move up because unemployment is low, companies have been absorbing that increase into their margins rather than raising prices."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"Oh, no, I was hoping that wouldn’t happen."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"Yes, yes."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,ANNEKEN TAPPE.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"Okay, great."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,I was asking if you could talk to us a little bit about the relationship between the persistent pandemic unemployment and the expected increase in inflation.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,I’m wondering whether the former offsets the latter and to which degree you guys are monitoring this.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,You’re asking about the relationship between unemployment and inflation?
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,Can you hear me now?
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,And that seems to be a feature of late-cycle behavior.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we’re, we’re not—when, when we—when we seek to achieve low unemployment, high levels of employment, which is our mandate, you know, we think we have the freedom to do that based on the data without worrying too much about inflation."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"And it’s—we don’t want to get into—I don’t want to get into trying to put a pin on the calendar someplace, because it’s going to be data dependent."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"When we see—when we see ourselves on track to make substantial further progress, we’re going to—we’re going to say so."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,We understand fully that that test is one that involves judgment.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"If you remember, during the Global Financial Crisis recovery, we said quantitative easing, number three, was—the test was a substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"Well, what does that mean?"
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"Well, it means a substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,It meant we would communicate when we thought we had that.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"This is just like that, in a way."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"So what, what I’m saying is, to achieve substantial progress from where we are, having had three months of, of very little progress, is going to take some time."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"What we’re saying is, substantial further progress toward our goals."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"And as we approach it, well in advance—well in advance—we will give a signal that, yes, we’re on a path to, to possibly achieve that, to consider tapering."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"So that’s, that’s how we’re planning to handle it."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s not different, really, from, from QE3."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I think we’ve learned—what we’ve learned from the experience of these last dozen years is to communicate very carefully, very clearly, well in advance, and then follow through with, with your communications."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"In this case, it’s, it’s an outcome-based set of guidance, as our rate guidance is, and it’s going to depend on the progress of the economy."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s why it’s not appropriate to start pointing at dates yet.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,GREG ROBB.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’ll tell people when we think—until we—until we say—until we give a signal, you can assume we’re not there yet."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,Okay.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,And I think it will be.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,Going to Greg Robb.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,GREG ROBB.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,Hi.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks for taking my question.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,I wanted to follow up a little bit.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"I, I understand what you’re saying about the dot plot and, and the message you’re trying to send with the dot plot."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,But does the same apply for the taper tantrum?
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"That’s—the expectation is, you’ll see now, I think, really strong job creation return—not as high as it was in the very early days of the recovery, the reopening of the economy, but, nonetheless, very strong."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"You’ve said that it’s going to take “some time” to get some fundamental progress on your goals, but it seems like “some time” could now be any time."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we’ve said “substantial further progress.” Now, if you go back, October, November—sorry, November, December, and January, progress in the labor market slowed very sharply."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"So you had an average of 29,000 jobs per month."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"If you go back and look at the, the level of job creation before that, it was very, very high—very high."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,So we weren’t making any progress on the labor market from November through January.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"February, we saw a nice—a nice pickup, a good jobs report—379,465 private sector."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,So that’s good.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"It can go so much higher, though."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, and, you know, it would be nice to see—to really make faster progress that’s different from substantial progress, we’d like to see it be, be higher than that."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,I think we’re—I think we’re in a good place.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"But companies choose not to try to, to pass that, that price increase along to their customers."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"But I don’t worry too much about us in the near term, because we’re, we’re on a very good track."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"Well, then I’ll ask about unemployment."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, there’s—the unemployment rate is—you all have projections for the U-6 rate, but you’ve also been, you know, really emphasizing the fact that that’s not the only thing that you all are looking at."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,You’re also looking at labor force participation and things like that.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,So are you all looking at ways of maybe adding to how you’re projecting the unemployment rate to the Summary of Economic Projections?
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"Well, let me say, as we say in our Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, we look to a range of indicators on the labor market."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"We never only looked at the unemployment rate, which is the only indicator of, of labor market outcomes that’s in the SEP. We look at a very broad range."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"You hear us talk all the time about participation; about employment to population, which is the combination of the two; about different measures of, of unemployment."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"So it’s wages, it’s, it’s the job flows, it’s, you know, all of those things."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,They go into an assessment—disparities of various groups.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,All that goes into an assessment of maximum employment.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"The, the—trying to incorporate all of that into the Summary of Economic Projections would not be practical."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, obviously, the thing that we do include is just the unemployment rate, and that’s a very insufficient statistic."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"So—it, it doesn’t include a lot of other things that we—that we do look at."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I, I wouldn’t want to say that we’re looking to include the other dozen things that we look at into the SEP."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"But at time—from time to time, we do look at, at adding different things."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"But I, I would just say the SEP is, it’s a summary."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,Okay.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,Sure.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,VICTORIA GUIDA.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"Because, because that one—I’m just going to say that we’ll have something in coming days."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"Nonetheless, you know, the bulk of the Committee—the, the largest part by far of the Committee is, is—doesn’t show a rate increase during this period."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, again, part of that is wanting to see actual data rather than just a forecast at this point."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"We do expect that we’ll begin to make faster progress on both spending—you know, labor markets and inflation as the year goes on because of the progress with the vaccines, because of the fiscal support that we’re getting."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,We expect that to happen.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, you know, we’ll have to see it first."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"Great, thank you."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,Victoria.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s one device.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,VICTORIA GUIDA.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,I wanted to ask about the supplementary leverage ratio.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, there’s been a lot of talk about what you all are going to do this month, which—I’m happy to hear an update if you have one."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"But just sort of more broadly, do you think, long term, that the leverage ratio poses problems for implementing monetary policy at a time when the reserve supply is going to remain large?"
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, if so, do you think the changes to the leverage ratio, including the SLR, are the way to deal with that problem?"
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"Victoria, we’ll have something to announce on that in coming days."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,And I’m not going to expound upon your questions.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,Why don’t you—why don’t you ask another question if you’d like to?
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Chair Powell."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s probably not a surprise that some people would bring in their estimate of the appropriate time for liftoff.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s not going to include all of the things that we look at.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,So we’re not actually looking actively at significantly broadening those indicators in the SEP right now.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,We will wait until the requirements set forth in that guidance are clearly met before considering a change in our policy rate.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"And the last thing I’ll say is this: The state of the economy in two or three years is highly uncertain, and I wouldn’t want to focus too much on the exact timing of a potential rate increase that far into the future."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"So that’s how I would think about the, the SEP. MICHELLE SMITH."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,Paul Kiernan.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,PAUL KIERNAN.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you, Chairman Powell."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,My question is twofold.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"One, how high are you comfortable letting inflation rise?"
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"There, there is some ambiguity in, in your new target, as you mentioned, “expectations driven.” And, and do you think that that ambiguity might cause markets to price in a lower tolerance for inflation than the Fed actually has, thereby causing financial conditions to tighten prematurely?"
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,Is that a concern?
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,So we’ve said we’d like to see inflation run moderately above 2 percent for some time.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we’ve resisted, basically, generally, the temptation to try to quantify that."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"Part of that just is, talking about inflation is one thing; actually having inflation run above 2 percent is the real thing."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I—you know, over the years we’ve, we’ve talked about 2 percent inflation as a goal, but we haven’t achieved it."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,It says that we’re committed to our framework and to the guidance we’ve provided to implement that framework.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"So what does—what does this, this SEP really say?"
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"And to meet these standards, we’ll need to see data, as I mentioned."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,It is the guidance that we chose carefully to implement our new framework.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"Chris Rugaber, Associated Press."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,CHRIS RUGABER.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"Chair Powell, I wanted to ask about the forecast overall."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"You’re forecasting a very low unemployment rate next year and in 2023, you have inflation—or, the Fed overall is, in the SEP, forecasting inflation at or above 2 percent by 2023, yet no rate hike in any of this—in any of this forecast horizon."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,So is this telling us that we could see a higher inflation rate than was projected?
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think you know the things that we look at—we, we talk about them all the time."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"Or do you not—as you’ve been talking about, is the unemployment rate insufficient?"
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I guess the first thing to say is that the, the SEP is not a Committee forecast."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s, it’s not something we sit around and debate and discuss and approve, and say, “This represents our, you know, our reaction function as a Committee.” It’s a compilation of projections from different people."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I—since we don’t debate it or discuss it, it would be hard for me to say why—exactly why each participant did what they were going to do."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,So all I would say about this is that we’ve—we laid out what I think is very clear guidance on liftoff.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"And it’s really three things: labor market conditions that are consistent with our estimates of maximum employment—and, as I mentioned, we consider a wide range of indicators in assessing labor market conditions, not just the unemployment rate; inflation that has reached 2 percent, and not just on a transitory basis; and inflation that’s on track to run moderately above 2 percent for some time."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,The first two of those three are very much data based; the third does have a little bit of a—of an element of expectations in it.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,So we are very much determined to implement this guidance in a robust way.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"Or what is this telling us about the Fed’s reaction function, that it seems you’re meeting the Fed’s dual mandate by 2023, yet, again, no rate hike expected?"
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, as, as data improve, as the outlook improves very significantly since the December meeting, you would expect forecasts to move up."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, you know, the, the strong bulk of the Committee is, is not showing a rate increase during this forecast period."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, we, we have—we debate things, we discuss things, and we always come together around a—around a, a solution."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"The overall recovery in economic activity since last spring is due importantly to unprecedented fiscal and monetary policy actions, which have provided essential support to households, businesses, and communities."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"The recovery has progressed more quickly than generally expected, and forecasts from FOMC participants for economic growth this year have been revised up notably since our December Summary of Economic Projections."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"In commenting on the stronger outlook, participants noted progress on vaccinations as well as recent fiscal policy."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"As with overall economic activity, conditions in the labor market have turned up recently."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"Employment rose by 379,000 in February, as the leisure and hospitality sector recouped about two-thirds of the jobs that were lost in December and January."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"Nonetheless, employment in this sector is more than 3 million below its level at the onset of the pandemic."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"For the economy as a whole, employment is 9.5 million below its pre-pandemic level."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"The unemployment rate remains elevated at 6.2 percent in February; this figure understates the shortfall in employment, particularly as participation in the labor market remains notably below pre-pandemic levels."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"Looking ahead, FOMC participants project the unemployment rate to continue to decline; the median projection is 4.5 percent at the end of this year and moves down to 3.5 percent by the end of 2023."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"The economic downturn has not fallen equally on all Americans, and those least able to shoulder the burden have been the hardest hit."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"In particular, the high level of joblessness has been especially severe for lower-wage workers in the service sector and for African Americans and Hispanics."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,The economic dislocation has upended many lives and created great uncertainty about the future.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,Overall inflation remains below our 2 percent longer-run objective.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"Over the next few months, 12-month measures of inflation will move up as the very low readings from March and April of last year fall out of the calculation."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"Beyond these base effects, we could also see upward pressure on prices if spending rebounds quickly as the economy continues to reopen, particularly if supply bottlenecks limit how quickly production can respond in the near term."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"However, these one-time increases in prices are likely to have only transient effects on inflation."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,The median inflation projection of FOMC participants is 2.4 percent this year and declines to 2 percent next year before moving back up by the end of 2023.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"The housing sector has more than fully recovered from the downturn, while business investment and manufacturing production have also picked up."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"In contrast, household spending on services remains low, especially in services that typically require people to gather closely, including travel and hospitality."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,Household spending on goods has risen notably so far this year.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"Following the moderation in the pace of the recovery that began toward the end of last year, indicators of economic activity and employment have turned up recently, although the sectors of the economy most adversely affected by the resurgence of the virus and by greater social distancing remain weak."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"Very strong fiscal support coming, now vaccination going quickly, and cases coming down."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"Transcript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference March 17, 2021 CHAIR POWELL."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,Good afternoon.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,I would like to start by noting that it has been a full year since the pandemic arrived with force on our shores.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"Looking back, it was clear that addressing a fast-moving global pandemic would be plainly and primarily the realm of health- care providers and experts, and we are grateful to them and to all the essential workers for their service and sacrifice."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,The danger to the U.S. economy was also clear.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"Congress provided by far the fastest and largest response to any postwar economic downturn, offering fiscal support for households, businesses, health-care providers, and state and local governments."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"Here at the Federal Reserve, we rapidly deployed our full range of tools to provide relief and stability, to ensure that the recovery will be as strong as possible, and to limit lasting damage to the economy."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"The Fed’s response to this crisis has been guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people, along with our responsibilities to promote the financial—the stability of the financial system."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,We are strongly committed to achieving the monetary policy goals that Congress has given us: maximum employment and price stability.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"More people held on to their jobs, more businesses kept their doors open, and more incomes were saved as a result of these swift and forceful policy actions."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"And while we welcome these positive developments, no one should be complacent."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,Today the FOMC kept interest rates near zero and maintained our sizable asset purchases.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"These measures, along with our strong guidance on interest rates and on our balance sheet, will ensure that monetary policy will continue to deliver powerful support to the economy until the recovery is complete."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,The path of the economy continues to depend significantly on the course of the virus and the measures undertaken to control its spread.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"Since January, the number of new cases, hospitalizations, and deaths has fallen, and ongoing vaccinations offer hope for a return to more normal conditions later this year."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"In the meantime, continued observance of social-distancing measures and wearing masks will help us reach that goal as soon as possible."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"The economic recovery remains uneven and far from complete, and the path ahead remains uncertain."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"The economic fallout has been real and widespread, but with the benefit of perspective, we can say that some of the very worst economic outcomes have been avoided by swift and forceful action—from Congress, from across government, and in cities and towns across the country."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"As we say in our Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, we view maximum employment as a “broad- based and inclusive goal.” Our ability to achieve maximum employment in the years ahead depends importantly on having longer-term inflation expectations well anchored at 2 percent."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"As the Committee reiterated in today’s policy statement, with inflation running persistently below 2 percent, we will aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time so that inflation averages 2 percent over time and longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2 percent."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,We expect to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until these employment and inflation outcomes are achieved.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, as you—as you pointed out, we’ve said that we would continue asset purchases at this pace until we see substantial further progress."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"And that’s actual progress, not forecast progress."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"So—and that’s a difference from, from our past approach."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"So—and what we mean by that is, is pretty straightforward."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"It is, we want to see that, that the labor markets have moved—labor market conditions have moved—you know, have made substantial progress toward maximum employment, and inflation has made substantial progress toward the 2 percent goal."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s what we’re going to want to see.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"Now, that obviously includes an element of judgment."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,And when we see—we’ll be—we’ll be carefully looking ahead.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,[Laughter] Not yet.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"We, we also understand that we, we will want to provide as much advance notice of any potential taper as possible."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,And we’ll say so well in advance of any decision to actually taper.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,HOWARD SCHNEIDER.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"If, if I could follow up on that, this shift in the dots—why wouldn’t that suggest a weakening of the commitment here?"
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"An awful lot of people shifted into 2022, it seems."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"I, I don’t see that at all."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, we, we have a, a range of perspectives on the Committee."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,I welcome that.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"So when we see that we’re on track, when we see actual data coming in that suggests that we’re on track to perhaps achieve substantial further progress, then we’ll say so."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I, I would say we’d like to, you know, perform."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"That still seems like some progress there, 4½ percent unemployment."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"With regard to interest rates, we continue to expect it will be appropriate to maintain the current 0 to ¼ percent target range for the federal funds rate until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee’s assessment of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"I would note that a transitory rise in inflation above 2 percent, as seems likely to occur this year, would not meet this standard."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"In addition, we will continue to increase our holdings of Treasury securities by at least $80 billion per month and of agency mortgage-backed securities by at least $40 billion per month until substantial further progress has been made toward our maximum-employment and price-stability goals."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,The increase in our balance sheet since last March has materially eased financial conditions and is providing substantial support to the economy.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"The economy is a long way from our employment and inflation goals, and it is likely to take some time for substantial further progress to be achieved."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"Our forward guidance for the federal funds rate, along with our balance sheet guidance, will ensure that the stance of monetary policy remains highly accommodative as the recovery progresses."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,Our guidance is outcome based and ties the path of the federal funds rate and the balance sheet to progress toward reaching our employment and inflation goals.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"Overall, our interest rate and balance sheet tools are providing powerful support to the economy and will continue to do so."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,Is it time to start talking about talking about tapering yet?
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"To conclude, we understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,We are committed to using our full range of tools to support the economy and to help assure that the recovery from this difficult period will be as robust as possible.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,I look forward to your questions.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,JOE PAVEL.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,Howard from Reuters.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,HOWARD SCHNEIDER.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Chair Powell, and, and thanks for that."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"So could you talk us through how the, the forecasts for 2021 map into the “substantial further progress” definition—you know, 2.4 percent inflation—I understand that’s considered transitory."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,Everything we do is in service to our public mission.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"That’s what we’d really like to do, is to get inflation moderately above 2 percent."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"At the Fed, we will continue to provide the economy the support that it needs for as long as it takes."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,And we haven’t done it yet.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"As recently as a year ago, February of last year, we had those, those disparities quite low."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"What happens in a downturn, though, is they move up at twice the speed of white unemployment."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,So we monitor those things.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"We—our tools, of course, affect unemployment generally, but we’re going to look at those as, as a form of slack in the labor market and hope that, you know, that there’s progress there."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, and this particular downturn, of course, was just a direct hit on, on a part of the economy that employs many minorities and lower-paid workers."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"The public-facing workers in the service industries in many cases don’t have a lot of financial assets, they’re not tremendously well paid, they might have other jobs, and things like that."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,So this was a direct hit on that part of the economy.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,And it’s the slowest part of the economy to recover.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, you know, we’d like to see those people continue to get supported, you know, as we—as the broader economy recovers, which, which it’s very much doing now."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"In terms of disparate levels of vaccination, that’s—those are facts and unfortunate facts."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"They’re really not something we, we have within our policy toolkit to address."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"But it is—it is true, though, that the data we have suggests that there are—there are significant disparities between different ethnic groups and—you know, but that’s, that’s not for us."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"That’s for fiscal authorities and the government more generally to, to work on."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,Jeanna Smialek.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,JEANNA SMIALEK.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s, it’s sad to see, because those disparities had really come down to record lows since we started keeping the data that way."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we look at those and we see those as, you know—it’s, it’s slack in the labor market."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"So the African American unemployment rate is substantially elevated, and so is the Hispanic unemployment rate."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we, we do monitor and communicate very regularly about different labor market—disparities in the labor market, let’s say."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, we—the tools we have are the tools we have."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"What I’m telling you is that the stance of monetary policy we have today, we believe, is appropriate."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"We think that our asset purchases in their current form—which is to say, you know, across the curve, $80 billion in Treasuries, $40 billion in mortgage-backed securities on net—we think that that’s, that’s the right place for our asset purchases."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"Now, we can—we can change them, of course, in, in a number of different dimensions should we deem that that’s appropriate."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, for now, we think that our policy stance on that is appropriate."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,Rachel Siegel.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hey, Chair Powell."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,RACHEL SIEGEL.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks very much for taking my question.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"You’ve spoken about the pandemic’s disproportionate toll on Black Americans, Hispanic Americans, Asian Americans, and other groups in the labor market."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,And I’m curious if you can speak to specific indicators that the Fed will be using to measure job gains for groups that have persistently higher rates of unemployment compared to white Americans.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, relatedly, since you’ve described vaccines as key to the economic recovery, is the Fed concerned about lower vaccination rates in communities of color?"
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,And what barriers do you think exist there?
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks very much.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, which measures."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Chair Powell."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks for taking our questions.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about how you see the fiscal policy support that has come down the line affecting the economy’s potential in the longer term, just in the sense that you’ve talked a lot about the potential for labor market scarring and how that might weigh on our, sort of, future prospects."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,And I wonder whether you see that sort of working in reverse.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,I wanted to ask a question about the euro zone.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"While the outlook for the U.S. economy has much improved, progress in the euro zone has been far less encouraging."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"And it’s showing signs of serious weakness due, due to the slower vaccination rollout and renewed lockdowns and restrictions."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"How worried are you about transatlantic economic divergence and the possibility that, that trouble in the euro zone and weakness in the euro zone could, could drag down the U.S. recovery as it did, in a way, in the aftermath of the financial crisis?"
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"You’re right that the pace of the recovery is that we’re having diverging recoveries here, as we did after the last crisis."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"And in this case, as well as the other one, the U.S.’s recovery is, is leading the global recovery."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, we conduct policy, of course, here."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you, Chair Powell."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"Our, our focus is on—our, you know—our, our objectives are domestic ones."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I think U.S. demand—very strong U.S. demand, if, if—as the economy improves is going to support global activity as well over time."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"That, that’ll be through imports."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, when the U.S. economy is strong, that strength tends to be—tends to support global, global activity as well."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,So that’s one thing.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,I don’t—I don’t worry in the near term.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mean, I’d love to see Europe growing faster."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,I’d love to see the vaccine rollout going more smoothly.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"I don’t want to be too specific about what that means, because I think it’s hard to do that."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s, it’s maximum employment and price stability here in the United States."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,JAMES POLITI.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, if we put people back into the labor market more quickly, does that improve our chances?"
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I do think that fiscal policy overall will have really helped us to avoid much of the scarring that we were very, very concerned about at the beginning."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I think that’s just the size and the speed with which Congress has delivered—you know, with the CARES Act and since then, has—is going to wind up very much accelerating the return to full employment."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s going to make a huge difference in people’s lives.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,And it has already.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"As I mentioned in my remarks—opening remarks, the recovery has been faster than we expected."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"Part of that just is, it’s very hard to predict, given we’ve never seen an event like this."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,James Politi.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"But part of it is just the strength of the fiscal response, which I think will, will look good over the years."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, and I hope we keep at it, and we will keep at it with our policies, of course, to do whatever we can to make sure that’s—that continues."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"Longer term though, what it takes to drive productive capacity per capita or per hour worked, to raise living standards over time, is investment: investment in people’s skills and aptitudes, investment in plant and equipment, investment in software."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"It takes a lot of investment to, to support a more productive economy and raise living standards."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"And that’s—you know, that hasn’t been the principal focus with these measures—our measures, certainly."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,And we don’t have those tools.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"But what Congress has been doing has mainly been replacing lost income and beginning to, you know, support people as the economy returns to normal."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"But there should be a focus on—a longer-term focus, I think, would be healthy on, on the investment front."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"Longer term, you know, to, to really—that’s—the first part of it is about avoiding scarring, and I think we’ve not avoided all of the scarring, but we’ve probably avoided the worst cases there."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,Is that something you feel to be the top of your toolbox or something that you don’t really prefer?
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"We monitor developments abroad, and we know—because they know we know that they can—those can affect our outcomes."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,STEVE LIESMAN.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mean, we’re—what we’re focused on is, is the part that we control, which is the support that we provide to the economy."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,And there we’ve provided very clear guidance.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"And in the case of asset purchases, it’s at their current level until we make substantial further progress."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"There is an element of judgment in that, and we’ll, we’ll— therefore, we’ll supply clear communication well in advance of, of actually tapering, and we just went through, you know, the, the criteria for raising interest rates."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,They’re very specific.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, we’re, we’re very much committed to having them fulfilled robustly."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"I, I would agree with you that the, the path of the virus continues to be very important."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"We, we have these, you know, new strains with—which, which can be quite virulent."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,And we’re not actually done yet.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I, I—we’re clearly on a good path with, with cases coming down, as I mentioned, but we’re not done."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,And I’d hate to see us take our eye off the ball before we actually finish the job.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,So that’s how I would look at that.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,MATTHEW BOESLER.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"If I could just briefly follow up, how do you see sort of the disconnect in terms of an economy that is expected to be widely reopened this year but full employment taking longer to achieve?"
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"Is it, is it the case that factors related to the virus will still be with us over the coming years?"
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,Is that how to interpret the forecasts?
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we’ll, we’ll leave that whole discussion to the experts."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,We’re not responsible for defining it.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,We don’t control that.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, on, on herd immunity, I, I’m really going to leave that question to the experts."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, when we’re actually above 2 percent, we can do that."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"Could, could you give us an idea of how you sort of feel about that tool, of being able to come into a particular part of the market and either operating—doing an Operation Twist or something like that?"
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"I—look, I, I would say this."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"The fundamental change in, in our framework is that we, we’re not going to act preemptively based on forecasts for the most part."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,And we’re going to wait to see actual data.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I think it will take people time to, to adjust to that—and to adjust to that new practice."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,So that’s how I would think about that.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,I think there’s some of that.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,MATTHEW BOESLER.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Chair Powell."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,This is Matthew Boesler with Bloomberg News.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,So there’s a widespread presumption at this point that the U.S. will reach herd immunity sometime this year.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"And all along, you’ve said that the path of the economy is going to be determined by the course of the virus."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"I’m curious, based on the projections that you released today that show unemployment will still be above estimates of maximum employment through the end of next year and perhaps sometime into 2023, do you think policymakers need to be doing more here to sort of align the herd immunity and full employment timelines, if you will?"
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,Matthew Boesler.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"Sure, there’ll be some of that."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,And the only way we can really build the credibility of that is by doing it.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"People may be, for example, going into spaces that, that, you know, that involve close contact with others."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"Would you comment on the current level of the 10-year yield and some other long rates out there, whether or not you think they would have a negative effect on the economy?"
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, if not, is there a level that would give you concern?"
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, finally, the third part: Other central bankers have expressed concern about what’s happened to yields in their countries and even some taken action, but not you."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"Could you give us your general idea or orientation towards the idea of, of coming into the market and affecting a particular tenor of the bond market?"
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,Do—do you like that idea?
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,Do you not like it?
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"Is it at the top of your toolbox, or is it something that you think is at the bottom of the toolbox?"
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,Sure.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we monitor a broad range of financial conditions, and we’re always attentive to market developments, of course."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,And we’re committed to maintaining that patiently accommodative stance until the job is well and truly done.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’re still a long way from our goals, and it’s important that financial conditions do remain accommodative to support the achievement of those goals."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"And if you look at various indexes of financial conditions, what you’ll see is that they generally do show financial conditions overall to be highly accommodative."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"So that’s, that’s how we look at it."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"I would add, as I’ve said, I would be concerned by disorderly conditions in markets or by a persistent tightening of financial conditions that threaten the achievement of our goals."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,We think the stance of our—of monetary policy remains appropriate.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,There will still be some social distancing.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"I wonder if you could—kind of a three- parter here, but all related."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"Mr. Chairman, thank you."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,And that is appropriate.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you, Steve Liesman."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,Some people will do that right away.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,STEVE LIESMAN.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,And so I think there’ll—there’ll be some of that.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"In addition, though, remember, there are—there are 10 million people—in the range of 10 million people who need to get back to work."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,And it’s going to take some time for that to happen.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, it can—it can happen maybe, maybe more quickly than it has in the past, because it involves the reopening of a sector of the economy, as opposed to stimulating aggregate demand and waiting for that to produce job demand for workers."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,This could be a different sort of a process.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,And it could be quicker.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,We don’t know that.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,Others will hold back.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,And it’s not going to happen overnight.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"But it’s, it’s just a lot of people who have—who need to get back to work."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, realistically, given the numbers, it’s going to take some time."
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,We’d welcome nothing more than that.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,I think the faster the better; we’d love to see it come sooner rather than later.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,Our guidance on the federal funds rate and on asset purchases is providing strong support for the economy.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,It would be—it’s going to take some time.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,So that’s all I can say.
2021-03-17,Press Conf - Full Text,"No matter how well the economy performs, unemployment will take quite a time to go—to go down, and so will participation."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"We, we also expect these, these bottleneck effects to come in."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,We don’t know how persistent they’ll be.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"We, we think they’ll—you know, it’s a matter of, of when they will pass through, not whether they will pass through."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,But we can’t be confident about the exact timing of that or the size of them.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"They don’t seem especially large at the moment, but, you know, we, we don’t know."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mean, you know, this is—this is all about the reopening of the economy."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s what’s happening.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"We had it—we were in a deep, deep hole a year ago, and now, with a lot of help from fiscal policy, some additional help from monetary policy, and, you know, a great deal of help from vaccination, we’re seeing a strong rebound in activity."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHAEL DERBY.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"And what’s happening is, it’s, it’s—demand can be spurred with fiscal transfers and—the saved-up fiscal transfers and, and people going back to work and things like that."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,The supply side will take a little bit of time to adapt.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,New restaurants will have to be opened.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,The supply of various inputs into the goods part of the economy will have to be brought back up to speed.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,And you—you’re seeing some of that.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"That’ll happen over a period of time, over coming quarters."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"You’ll see some of the bottlenecks resolved, but the last one may not be resolved for some time."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"We expect—as I mentioned, we expect core and, and headline PCE to move up because of base effects, and—you know, I—and we expect that to go away."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, we’re, we’re—inflation measures are always going to be a bit volatile."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,It doesn’t work that way.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"Inflation expectations before the pandemic hit—and here we think of survey, market based—survey being either households or, or economists and, and market based."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"You look at all of those, and I would say that they were at the low end of what would have been consistent with a 2 percent inflation target, particularly our 2 percent inflation target, which calls for 2 percent average inflation."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,So they’re at the low end.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"Inflation expectations actually went down a bit at the beginning of the pandemic, and now they’ve just moved back up to levels broadly—that, that are where they were in 2018, or in some cases 2014, and, I would say, more consistent with our mandate."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we want them to be—we want them to be higher and—you know, on a persistent basis."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,We want inflation to run a little bit higher than it has been running for the last quarter of a century.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"We want it to average 2 percent, not 1.7 percent."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"And for that, we need to see inflation expectations that are consistent with that, really well anchored at 2 percent."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"We don’t really see that yet, but I would say that, that, you know, breakevens have moved up, in a way."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"Breakevens are based on CPI, of course, but they’re, they’re now at levels that are—that are pretty close to mandate consistent, whereas before, they were below."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"We monitor inflation expectations very, very carefully, as you would obviously know."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,So that’s where—that’s where I would say it is.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHAEL DERBY.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,Right.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"Do you have any redlines on inflation readings where if, you know, you hit, like, a certain number on, say, you know, core PCE, that would be, you know, a trigger response from the Fed?"
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,Just one small follow-up.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"I won’t say it has nothing to do with monetary policy, but it also—it has a tremendous amount to do with vaccination and reopening of the economy."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,Asset prices was one.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"Leverage in the financial system is, is not an issue; we have very well capitalized large banks."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"We have funding risks for, for our largest financial institutions that are also very low."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"We do have some funding risk issues around money market funds, but I would say they’re not systemic right now."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, and the household sector is actually in pretty good shape."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"It was in—it was in a very good shape as a relative matter before the financial crisis—sorry, the pandemic crisis hit."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"There were real concerns, of course, with high levels of unemployment and loss of wages and all of that, that the—that the household sector would, would, would weaken dramatically."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s a—that’s a—that was one of the four pillars.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,That hasn’t happened.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,You see relatively low defaults and that kind of thing.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"So the overall financial stability picture is mixed, but, on balance, it’s—you know, it’s manageable, I would say."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"And it’s—by the way, I think it’s appropriate and important for financial conditions to remain accommodative to support economic activity."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"Is that something that worries you, or do you see that as, maybe, you know, the success of the Fed’s new inflation framework, you know, making it out to the, to the broader public?"
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"Again, 8½ million people who had jobs in February don’t have them now, and, you know, there’s a long way to go until we reach our goal."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,So that’s what I would say.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,BRIAN CHEUNG.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, with the fiscal transfers, money that’s on household balance sheets, they’re in good shape."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"The other—the other things, though—you know, leverage in the financial system, is it— is, is not a problem."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"So that’s, that’s part of what’s going on."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s really what has been moving markets a lot in the last few months is this turn away from what was a pretty dark winter to now a fast—a much faster vaccination process and a faster reopening.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,Brian Cheung.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,BRIAN CHEUNG.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"Brian Cheung with—hi, Chairman Powell."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,Brian Cheung with Yahoo Finance.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"I wanted to ask about financial stability, which is a part of the Fed’s reaction function here."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"It seems like to people on the outside who might not follow finance daily, they’re paying attention to things like GameStop, now Dogecoin."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"And it seems like there’s interesting reach for yield in this market—to some extent, also Archegos."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"So does the Fed see a relationship between low rates and easy policy to those things, and is there a financial stability concern from the Fed’s perspective at this time?"
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,Right.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we look at—financial stability for us is really—we have a broad framework, so we don’t just jump from one thing to another."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"I know many people just look at asset prices, and they look at some of the things that are going on in the—in the equity markets, which, which I think do reflect froth in the equity markets."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"But really, it—really, we try to stick to a framework for financial stability so we can—so we can talk about it the same way each time and so we can be held accountable for it."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"So one of the areas is asset prices, and I would say some of the asset prices are high."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"You are seeing, seeing things in the capital markets that, that are—that are a bit frothy."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s a fact.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I wondered, you know, if, if that was something that you saw consistent with your inflation outlook."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I think, you know, we bring that understanding into our lives and, frankly, into our work—the work that we do as well."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"I wanted to ask you another question about inflation, and it has to do with inflation expectations."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I—you know, I—I’ve met with homeless people many times, a number of times, anyway, let’s say."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I, I think it’s always good to talk to people and hear what’s going on in their lives."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"What you find out is, they’re you."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,They’re just us.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mean, they’re, they’re—these are people who, in many cases, had jobs and, you know, they have lives, and they’ve just, they’ve just found themselves in this place."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s, it’s a—it’s a difficult problem, though."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, there are many, many facets of it, and I’m well aware that this is not something that the Fed has all the tools for or anything like that."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"But I will—I will go visit when, when it’s no longer a, a news story."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"But I, I will do that when, when the need arises and when, when it’s not so much, you know, in the public eye."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,And is there anything specifically that you would be looking to learn there?
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,Not really.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mean, I, I think I know what I’ll find there."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"I, I think you, you connect with these people and what you—again, what you find is, they’re like you."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,That could be you.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mean, that could be your sister."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"That could be, you know, your kid."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"I don’t want to visit it at a time of a lot of media attention, because I don’t want that to be part of the story."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, frankly, yes."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"In the grand scheme of these large institutions, the Archegos risks were not systemically important or were not of the size that they would have really created trouble for any of those institutions."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"As a follow-up, you mentioned money market pressures."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"What was troubling, though, was that this could happen in a business for a number of firms that is thought to be—to carry relatively well understood risks."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"The prime brokerage business is, is a well understood business, and so it was surprising that a number of them would have had this."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"And it was essentially, I believe, the fact that, that they had the same big risk position on with a number of firms, and they weren’t—some of the firms were not aware that there were other firms that had those things."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"I, I wouldn’t say it’s in any way an indictment of our supervision of these firms."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"It, it—in some cases, it may be they were—it seems as though there were risk-management breakdowns at some of the firms, not all of them."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"I have not had a chance to do it yet, but I’ve been very busy, but I will visit."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,And that’s what we’re looking into.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,Nancy Marshall-Genzer.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Chair Powell."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"I—I’m wondering, are you planning to visit the homeless encampment that’s near the Fed in Washington that you drive by?"
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"Have you been invited, and if you went, what would you be looking to learn there?"
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"A number of different surveys and, and market indicators are showing, you know, multiyear highs in inflation expectations ratings."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"You, you always feel that way in that sort of an encounter, and, you know, it just is a—it’s a—it’s an important thing to engage in, I think."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I’m not so concerned about, about that."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,I am really concerned about getting it right.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"It is—it is a—it is a tricky set of questions that we have to navigate in a world where we already have, remember, a highly evolved payment system."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,We have FedNow and other immediately available funds.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"Pretty soon everybody will be able to, to do what people do in other parts of the world, which is just use their phone to make immediately available payments all the time."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,It’ll be normal.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,And what would be the role of a central bank digital currency in that kind of an environment?
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, ask yourself the question, does that mean that, if you were a company that’s doing international business, would you then suddenly start to use that currency to use your—do your international transactions, or would you still do them in dollars, where, where— which is what everyone does?"
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,Far more important to get it right than it is to do it fast or feel that we need to rush to reach conclusions because other countries are moving ahead.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s, it’s one that really allows the government to see every payment that’s used—for which it is used in real time."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s much more to do with things that are happening within their own financial system than it is, I think, to do with, with the global—you know, sort of global competition."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,Michael Derby.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHAEL DERBY.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you for taking my question.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mean, that—what the China—the currency that’s being used in China is not one that would—that would work here."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,I am—I’m less concerned that someone—that another country might have a digital currency first.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, of course, we have open capital accounts, which is essential if you’re going to be the reserve currency."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,Hannah Lang.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,HANNAH LANG.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,Hi.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,I wanted to ask about digital currency.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,You previously said a few times that you think it’s important for the U.S. to get a central bank digital currency right rather than be first.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"But with countries like China moving very quickly on CBDC, I was wondering what you think the risks are of, of moving too slow on, on digital currency."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,So those are the factors that make us the reserve currency.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,Right.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"Central bank digital currencies are now possible, and we’re going to see some of them around the world."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,And we need to understand whether that’s something that would be a good thing for the people that we serve.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,How would it work in our system?
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"And there are some very, very difficult questions to answer, but I think we—and we are engaged in a serious program to understand both the technology and the policy issues."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"I am—I would say this: We’re the world’s reserve currency, and that means that the dollar is used in transactions all around the world, far more than any other currency."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"And that’s because of our rule of law; our democratic institutions, which are the best in the world; our economy; our industrious people; all the things that make the United States the United States."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"That’s why we’re the, the reserve currency."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I think the first thing to say is that we feel an obligation to understand the technology and all of the policy issues very, very well."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,The Fed didn’t make changes to interest on reserves or excess reserves.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Greg Robb from MarketWatch."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,It seems like SOFR has been drifting closer to zero.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"And for the last question, we’ll go to Mike McKee."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHAEL MCKEE.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"Since I am last, let me go back to Paul’s question, the first question, and ask him—ask you whether—not whether you’re thinking about thinking of tapering, but why you’re not."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,We’re seeing bank lending fall.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,The markets seem to be operating well.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"Or is it, as one money manager put it, “If you get out of the markets, there aren’t enough buyers for all of the Treasury debt, and so rates would have to go way up”?"
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"The bottom-line question is, what do we get for $120 billion a month that we couldn’t get for less?"
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,So it’s really not more complicated than this.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"We, we articulated the “substantial further progress” test at our December meeting."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, really, for the next couple of months, we made relatively little progress toward our goals."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, remember, substantial further progress from December—from our December meeting."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,Are you afraid of a taper tantrum?
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,And then vaccination started to get more widespread.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,GREG ROBB.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"So—and, you know, it’s, it’s a situation where we will, we will taper asset purchases when the time comes to do that, and those, those purchases will come to zero over time."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,Greg Robb.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,GREG ROBB.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you—thank you so much for the—for the opportunity.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,I wanted to circle back to the housing market.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s just kind of confusing that the question and your answer—you know, the housing market is strong, prices are up."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,And yet the Fed is buying $40 billion per month in mortgage-related assets.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"Why is that, and are those purchases playing a role at all in pushing up prices?"
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,And that time is not yet.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,Yes.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"I, I mean, we’re—we started buying MBS because the mortgage-backed security market was, was really experiencing severe dysfunction, and we’ve sort of, sort of articulated, you know, what our exit path is from that."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s not meant to provide direct assistance to, to the housing market."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,That was never the intent.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,It was really just to keep that as—it’s a very close relation to the Treasury market and a very important market on its own.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"And so that’s, that’s why we, we bought as we did during the Global Financial Crisis; we bought MBS too."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"Again, not, not an intention to send help to the housing market, which was, which was really not, not a problem this time at all."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,The economy reopened.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,We got a really nice job report for March.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,It doesn’t constitute substantial further progress.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s, it’s really part of overall accommodative financial conditions."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"We, we have tried to create accommodative financial conditions to support economic activity, and we did that."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we articulated the—you know, the, the tests for withdrawing that accommodation."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we think, you know—so we’re waiting to see those tests to be fulfilled both for asset purchases and for liftoff of rates."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, when the tests are fulfilled, we’ll, we’ll go ahead."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"As we—you know, we’ve done this before."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"We did it in, in the last—after the last crisis, and, you know, we’ll do it in, in maybe—we’ll do it—as those tests are satisfied, we’ll do it."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mean, I think the effect is proportional to the amount we buy."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"And the—and the only thing that will guide us is, are the tests met?"
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"That will be the test for, for tapering asset purchases and for raising interest rates."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you very much.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,Take care.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"We don’t manage their companies for them or, or try to manage individual risks."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, that, that’s what we focused on: Is—have, have the macroeconomic conditions that we’ve articulated, have they been realized?"
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"But if we bought less, you know, no."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"So if someone has the volume, they can turn it up."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"You’re, you’re very faint."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s not close to substantial further progress.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,We’re hopeful that we will see along this path a way to that goal.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,And we believe we will; it just is a question of when.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"And so, when that time—when the time comes for us to talk about talking about it, we’ll do that."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,And—but that time is not now.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s—we’re just not—we’re not that far.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,We’ve had one great jobs report.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s not enough.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, we’re going to act on actual data, not on our forecast."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,And we’re just going to need to see more data.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"That’s—it’s no, no more complicated than that."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHAEL MCKEE.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"Well, if you leave rates where they are, it doesn’t change anything."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,But does it change anything if you actually tapered a bit?
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"If you spent less, would you still get the same effect on the economy?"
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,If we bought less?
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,What was the logic behind that?
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,We don’t seek a seat at that table.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"So capital is, is in a good place, as far as I’m concerned, in the banking system."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, to your point, what we saw was—so what, what kind of happened during the pandemic crisis that, that requires attention, and number one is money market funds and corporate bond funds where we saw run dynamics again, and we need to—we’re, we’re looking at that."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we’re looking at ways, and people around the world are looking at ways, to make those vehicles resilient so that they don’t have to be, you know, supported by the government whenever there’s, you know, severely stressed market conditions."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s a private business.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"They, they need to have the wherewithal to stay in business and not just count on the Fed and others to—around the world to come in."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,So that was that.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,The other one is Treasury market structure.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"And the banks really made it through a real stress test very well and passed three, three of our—two of our stress tests, and that is another one that’s pending."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"Dealers are committing less capital to that activity now than they were 10 or 15 years ago, and the need for capital is higher because there’s so much more supply of Treasuries."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,It needs to be liquid.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,It needs to function well for the good of our economy and the good of our citizens.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"So it’s not clear what, what—where that takes you, but we, we are taking a careful look—and the Treasury Department is, is really going to be leading this—at, at Treasury market structure and all of the various aspects of that to make sure that we do have a resilient, strong Treasury market that can work even in difficult times."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"As, as you know, at the very beginning of the financial—of the—of this recent crisis, there was such a demand for selling Treasuries, including by foreign central banks, that, really, the dealers couldn’t handle the volume."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"And so what was happening was, the market was really starting to lose function, and that’s—that was a really serious problem which we had to solve through really massive asset purchases."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, so we’d like to, we’d like to see if there isn’t something we can do to—is—do we need to build against that kind of an extreme tail risk, and if so, what would that look like?"
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"And so there are some questions about Treasury market structure, and there’s a lot of careful work going on to understand whether there’s something we can do about this, because we—you know, the U.S. Treasury market is probably the most single important—single most important market in, in the economy and the world."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I think capital requirements for banks are, to me—went up tremendously, really, over the course of the 10 years between the financial crisis and the arrival of the pandemic."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,So just hoping for clarification on that.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,Right.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"So the federal funds rate has been well within target and—at target range, and money market funds—money market conditions are, are fine."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,We have the ability to use our administrative tools to make sure that that remains the case.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"We do expect further downward pressure on, on rates through asset purchases and also the runoff in the—in the Treasury General Account."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, at this point, we didn’t see a need for—to, to deploy our tools to, to support rates."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, of course, we will do so if, if the need does arise."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,Jean Yung.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,JEAN YUNG.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Chair Powell."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"I wanted to ask a, a similar question."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"We are seeing elevated market valuations, and some economists are concerned that the economy might overheat, at least for a period of time."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,So should the Fed and other regulators be thinking about tightening capital requirements or extending oversight to the nonbank sector so that financial stability risks stay as low as they have been?
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,Edward Lawrence.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,EDWARD LAWRENCE.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you, Fed Chairman, for the question."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"That’s, that’s really all it is."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"It doesn’t have any, any external, virus- related specific requirement, although, again, I do think it’ll—you know, the, the virus will need to continue to be controlled for us to achieve those economic goals."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,But it’s really the economic goals.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"Now, your second question."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"Sorry, just say again."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,I didn’t quite get that question.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,EDWARD LAWRENCE.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,But it’s about substantial further progress toward our goals.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"Yes, sure."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,So it’s really up to Congress.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,We—we’re not an adviser to Congress.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, we don’t, we don’t weigh in on specific fiscal bills or proposals."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s really between elected parties.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, basically, fiscal policy is the province of people who stand for democratic election and win, and they get to make those very difficult decisions, and they get to be accountable to the voters."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"We didn’t do any of that, and we don’t have a seat at that table."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"With all the fiscal spending that’s happened and the accommodation and—does, does the system need more spending either from the fiscal side or accommodation, or would more spending affect the transitory nature of the inflation and put those upward, upward pressures on inflation long term?"
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, and so there’ll be a lot of warning and that kind of thing."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’re going to let, you know, the, the public know that that’s what we’re thinking."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we’re, we’re going to communicate well in advance of any decision."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,So I’m interested in your thoughts.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,There’s so much fiscal help and accommodation from the Federal Reserve.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"You said today the vaccinations will follow the normal economic conditions or, or lead to more normal economic conditions later this year."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"When do you see the economy being able to stand on its own feet, so to speak?"
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, along those lines, with the fiscal spending and the accommodation you talked about with transitory inflation, does more spending need to be injected into the system, or will that affect that transitory nation—nature of the inflation?"
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"When will the economy be, be able to stand on its own feet?"
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,I’m not sure if—I’m not sure what the exact nature of that question is.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,EDWARD LAWRENCE.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"What, what I’m saying is, is, you know, when will the—when will you need to lower the, the amount of Treasuries you’re buying to sort of taper off a little bit?"
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,When can it stand without having that support from the monetary policy side?
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"And then—and then, further, the transitory."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,Okay.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,Sorry.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we have—you know, we’ve articulated our test for that, as you know, and that is just, we’ll continue asset purchases at this pace until we see substantial further progress."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"So that’s really something for Congress and the Administration to, to deal with."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’re, we, we supervise banks to make sure that they have risk- management systems in place so that they can spot these things."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"There are, you know, many, many, many factors that go into it."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"And then, what regulatory changes would you like to see implemented to change that going forward?"
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s much more likely that we would—having achieved maximum-employment conditions—we’d also be seeing 2 percent inflation and be on track to see inflation moving above 2 percent.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,They tend to move together.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"So that’s not to say inflation won’t—might not move up, but for inflation to move up in a persistent way that, that really starts to move inflation expectations up, that would have to—that would take some time."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"And you would think that, that it would be quite likely that, that we’d be in very strong labor markets for that to be happening."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"If it—if that actually were to happen, though, there is a—there’s a paragraph in the—in the Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy which says that when the two goals are somewhat in conflict, we weigh various factors, including the, the time it would take to get back and [so] forth."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we do—it doesn’t really tell you what to do, but it tells you that we will weigh those two factors and how far we are away from them and how long it would take to reach them were we to reach that sort of pretty unlikely state."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"I won’t say that it’s impossible, but it, it seems—it seems unlikely."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,STEVE LIESMAN.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"Mr. Chairman, I want to follow up on Jonnelle’s question, and I wonder if you can help us understand better your thinking about how COVID infection rates and the virus calibrate with monetary policy."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"As you recall, we had a major resurgence in the virus last fall."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I’m wondering, would you need to be assured that there wasn’t such a resurgence coming before you began—I mean, for lack of a better term—thinking about thinking about tapering?"
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,And what kind of comfort level would you need?
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"Would it be something that would be declared from the CDC or the, or the World Health Organization—for example, downgrading the virus from a pandemic—before you have the comfort level to reverse course on policy?"
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,Steve Liesman.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"So it seems unlikely, frankly, that we would see inflation moving up in a persistent way that would actually move inflation expectations up while there was still significant slack in the labor market."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"So—and that is, that is what it is, substantial further progress."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"For interest rates, as I—as I said a moment ago, we want to see labor market conditions consistent with maximum employment, we want to see inflation at 2 percent, and we want to see it on track to exceed 2 percent."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,So those are our tests.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,We don’t have an independent test to do with the virus.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"I will say, though, as I—as I started with, you know, the, the path of the virus is going to have an effect on our ability to achieve both of those tests."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,Great.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,Right.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,JEANNA SMIALEK.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Chair Powell."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks for taking our questions.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,I wonder if you could talk a little bit about that test for raising interest rates that you just elaborated.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,You’ve obviously made it very clear that you want to see improvements in the real economy and the real data and not in just sort of expectations data before making that move.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,But I guess I wonder what happens if inflation expectations were to move up before you see some sort of return to full employment.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, it seems like a lot of sort of the stability in inflation has been tied to the fact that those have been so low and stable, and I guess I wonder how, how your reaction would be—sort of how your reaction to that is, is—how you’re thinking about that."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,Jeanna.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"So for, for asset purchases, we’ve said that we would continue at the current pace of asset purchases until we see substantial further progress toward our goals."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"We, we really have—just articulated the goals that I’ve—that I’ve just mentioned a couple of times, which is substantial further progress toward our goals before we taper."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"Same thing with these small businesses, many of which are the work of generations."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,Were we going to wipe out many of those unnecessarily?
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,That was a big concern.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"I would say that, so far, you know, here we are in late April of 2021."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,We haven’t experienced that level of scarring either in the labor market or among smaller businesses.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we’re not living that, that downside case that we were very concerned about a year ago."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"Notwithstanding that, we’re a long way from full employment."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,The evidence is clear that it becomes much more difficult if you’re out for a long time to get back in and get back to the life that you had.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’re—you know, payroll jobs are 8.4 million below where they were in February of 2020."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"And also, it’s going to be a different economy."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we’ve been hearing a lot from companies that they are—they’ve been looking at deploying better technology and perhaps fewer people, including in some of the service industries that have been employing a lot of people."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, it, it may well be—it seems quite likely that a number of the people who, who had those service-sector jobs will struggle to find the same job and may need time to find work and get back to the working life they had."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,These were people who were working in February of 2020.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,They clearly want to work.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,So those people are going to need—they’re going to need help.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"And so, while I would say we haven’t seen really highly elevated levels of unemployment for—you know, up in the teens that we thought we might have for an extended period of time, we’ve still got a lot of people who are out to—out of work."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,We’ve got a long ways to go.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,Yes.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I would say that we were very worried about scarring, both in the labor market from people being out of—out of the labor market for an extended period of time."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,Where are you most worried about that showing up?
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"Now, that’s very likely—for us to achieve that, it’s very likely going to be the case that we’ve also made really significant progress on controlling the virus through vaccination and, and other—it, it—you know, those two things should more or less coexist."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"We haven’t articulated a separate test for a state of the virus that we’d like to achieve because we’re not—you know, we’re not experts in that area."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’re, we’re really focused on the economic outcomes, and, again, my, my guess is that we—it’s very likely, it seems to me, that for us to achieve the economic outcomes, we would need to taper or to raise interest rates."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"We would also have to have made very substantial progress in getting the virus under control—not, not necessarily fully under control."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"There is a, a possibility, of course, that we will, will have ongoing outbreaks over the summer and various regional outbreaks and potentially next winter as well."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,But we’ll be looking for substantial progress toward our goal—substantial further progress toward our goals as we think about tapering asset purchases.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,STEVE LIESMAN.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,Victoria.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,VICTORIA GUIDA.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Chair Powell."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"I wanted to ask, you’ve talked a lot during this crisis about the need to have a lot of help from fiscal policy and monetary policy to make sure that there’s not long-term scarring in the economy."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I was just wondering, you know, given all of the policies that have been put in place, do you expect there to still be some long-term scarring?"
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, if so, you know, what are you most worried about?"
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"There may be people who are around the edges of the labor force who won’t come back in unless they feel really comfortable going back to their old jobs, for example, and there, there may be parts of the economy that will—that just won’t be able to, to really fully reengage until the pandemic is decisively behind us."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,The economy can’t fully recover until people are confident that it’s safe to resume activities involving crowds of people.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"Yes, so we have to leave questions about herd immunity and what that looks like to the health experts, but, but I would certainly say that what matters the most to the economic recovery continues to be controlling the virus."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"For the economy as a whole, payroll employment is 8.4 million below its pre-pandemic level."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"The unemployment rate remained elevated at 6 percent in March, and this figure understates the shortfall in employment, particularly as participation in the labor market remains notably below pre-pandemic levels."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"The economic downturn has not fallen equally on all Americans, and those least able to shoulder the burden have been the hardest hit."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"In particular, the high level of joblessness has been especially severe for lower-wage workers in the service sector and for African Americans and Hispanics."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,The economic dislocation has upended many lives and created great uncertainty about the future.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,Readings on inflation have increased and are likely to rise somewhat further before moderating.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"In the near term, 12-month measures of PCE inflation are expected to move above 2 percent as the very low readings from early in the pandemic fall out of the calculation and past increases in oil prices pass through to consumer energy prices."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"Nonetheless, employment in this sector is still more than 3 million below its level at the onset of the pandemic."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"Beyond these effects, we are also likely to see upward pressure on prices from the rebound in spending as the economy continues to reopen, particularly if supply bottlenecks limit how quickly production can respond in the near term."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"The Fed’s response to this crisis has been guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people, along with our responsibilities to promote the stability of the financial system."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"As we say in our Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, we view maximum employment as a broad-based and inclusive goal."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,Our ability to achieve maximum employment in the years ahead depends importantly on having longer-term inflation expectations well anchored at 2 percent.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"As the Committee reiterated in today’s policy statement, with inflation running persistently below 2 percent, we will aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time so that inflation averages 2 percent over time and longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2 percent."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,We expect to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until these employment and inflation outcomes are achieved.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"With regard to interest rates, we continue to expect it will be appropriate to maintain the current 0 to ¼ percent target range for the federal funds rate until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee’s assessment of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,I would note that a transitory rise in inflation above 2 percent this year would not meet this standard.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"However, these one-time increases in prices are likely to have only transitory effects on inflation."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"In addition, we will continue to increase our holdings of Treasury securities by at least $80 billion per month and of agency mortgage-backed securities by at least $40 billion per month until substantial further progress has been made toward our maximum-employment and price-stability goals."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"Employment rose 916,000 in March, as the leisure and hospitality sector posted a notable gain for the second consecutive month."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"In the meantime, continued observance of public health and safety guidance will help us reach that goal as soon as possible."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"Transcript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference April 28, 2021 CHAIR POWELL."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,Good afternoon.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"At the Federal Reserve, we are strongly committed to achieving the monetary policy goals that Congress has given us: maximum employment and price stability."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,Today my colleagues on the FOMC and I kept interest rates near zero and maintained our sizable asset purchases.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"These measures, along with our strong guidance on interest rates and on our balance sheet, will ensure that monetary policy will continue to deliver powerful support to the economy until the recovery is complete."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"Widespread vaccinations, along with unprecedented fiscal policy actions, are also providing strong support to the recovery."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"As with overall economic activity, conditions in the labor market have continued to improve."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"Since the beginning of the year, indicators of economic activity and employment have strengthened."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"The housing sector has more than fully recovered from the downturn, while business investment and manufacturing production have also increased."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"Spending on services has also picked up, including at restaurants and bars."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"More generally, the sectors of the economy most adversely affected by the pandemic remain weak but have shown improvement."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"While the recovery has progressed more quickly than generally expected, it remains uneven and far from complete."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,The path of the economy continues to depend significantly on the course of the virus and the measures undertaken to control its spread.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"Since March, progress on vaccinations has limited the number of new cases, hospitalizations, and deaths."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"While the level of new cases remains concerning, especially as it reflects the spread of more infectious strains of the virus, continued vaccinations should allow for a return to more normal economic conditions later this year."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,Household spending on goods has risen robustly.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,The increase in our balance sheet since March 2020 has materially eased financial conditions and is providing substantial support to the economy.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"The economy is a long way from our goals, and it is likely to take some time for substantial further progress to be achieved."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,Our guidance for interest rates and asset purchases ties the path of the federal funds rate and the size of the balance sheet to our employment and inflation goals.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,We first articulated this “substantial further progress” test at our December meeting.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,Economic activity and hiring have just recently picked up after slowing over the winter.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,And it will take some time before we see substantial further progress.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,PAUL KIERNAN.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"In the meantime, we’ll be monitoring progress toward our goals."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,Jonnelle at Reuters.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,Okay.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,Hi.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you so much.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"My question is about what’s going on with the virus, and what if we don’t reach a level of herd immunity, per se."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, in your scenario, thinking about the outlook and the economy, do you have some model where you might start to still normalize policy even if there’s like a baseline of infection still going on?"
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"Or how can you, you know, talk about how you’re weighing those things?"
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,JONNELLE MARTE.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’ve said that we would let the public know when it is time to have that conversation, and we said we’d do that well in advance of any actual decision to taper our asset purchases, and we will do so."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, no, it is not time yet."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,This outcome-based guidance will ensure that the stance of monetary policy remains highly accommodative as the recovery progresses.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"To conclude, we understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,Everything we do is in service to our public mission.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,We at the Fed will do everything we can to support the economy for as long as it takes to complete the recovery.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,I look forward to your questions.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you, Mr."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,Chair.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,First we’ll go Paul Kiernan.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,PAUL KIERNAN.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Chairman Powell."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks for doing this.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"I guess, since I’m first, I’ll go ahead and re-up Howard’s question from the last press conference: Is it time to start talking about talking about tapering yet?"
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,Have you and your colleagues had any conversations to this effect?
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"We want to get them back to work as quickly as possible, and that’s really one of the things we’re trying to achieve with our policy."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, you know, we’ve articulated particular guidance for tapering our asset purchases and for lifting off and raising interest rates."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,Rachel Siegel.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,That process has already started to show up.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"You saw it in the March CPI reading, and you’ll see it later this week in the PCE price data."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,These base effects will contribute about 1 percentage point to headline inflation and about 0.7 percentage point to core inflation in April and May.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, significant increases, and they’ll disappear over the following months."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,And they’ll be transitory.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,They carry no implication for the rate of inflation in later periods.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,So that’s base effects.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,Twelve-month measures of inflation are likely to move well above 2 percent over the next few months as the very low inflation readings recorded in March and April of last year drop out of the calculation.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,The other big one I would talk about is bottlenecks.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, the Fed has a network of contacts that is unequaled in businesses and in nonprofits for that matter, too."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,So what do we mean by a bottleneck?
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"A bottleneck really is a temporary blockage or restriction in the supply chain for, for a particular good or goods, something that slows down the process of producing goods and delivering them to the market."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"We think of bottlenecks as things that, in their nature, will be resolved as workers and businesses adapt, and we think of them as not calling for a change in monetary policy since they’re temporary and expected to resolve themselves."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,We know that the base effects will disappear in a few months.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s much harder to predict with confidence the amount of time it will take to resolve the bottlenecks, or for that matter, the temporary effects that they will have on prices in the meantime."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, you know, I’ll just sum up and say, we understand our job."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"So this is what we’re seeing in supply chains in various industries, and we’re, we’re in close touch with all of these industries."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we are, we are focused—as you’ve seen, for many years, we’ve been focused on inflation deviating below 2 percent, and we used our tools aggressively to keep it back up at 2 percent."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,The first is the base effects.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"So that’s a very different situation than you had back in the 1960s—or many, many differences, actually."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks for your question.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I actually have a couple things I’d like to say about inflation, including addressing your question."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,So let me start with just saying that we’re very strongly committed to achieving our objectives of maximum employment and price stability.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"Our, our price stability goal is 2 percent inflation over the longer run, and we believe that having inflation average 2 percent over time will help anchor long-term inflation expectations at 2 percent."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"With inflation having run persistently below 2 percent for some time, the Committee seeks inflation moderately above inflation for two times—above 2 percent for some time."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, with a, a little bit of context, we’re, we’re making our way through an unprecedented series of events, really, in which a synchronized global shutdown is now giving way to widespread reopening of economies in many places around the world."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"So let me talk quickly about the two reasons—two, or you could say three, but really two main reasons why we think inflation will move up in the near term."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"In the United States, fiscal and monetary policy continue to provide strong support: Vaccinations are now widespread, and the economy is beginning to move ahead with real momentum."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,But those pressures are likely to be temporary as they are associated with the reopening process.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"In an episode of one-time price increases as the economy reopens is not the same thing as, and is not likely to lead to, persistently higher year-over-year inflation into the future— inflation at levels that are not consistent with our goal of 2 percent inflation over time."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"Indeed, it is the Fed’s job to make sure that that does not happen."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"If, if, contrary to expectations, inflation were to move persistently and materially above 2 percent in a manner that threatened to move longer-term inflation expectations materially above 2 percent, we would use our tools to bring inflation and expectations down to mandate-consistent levels."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I would say, if I may, that is a principal difference from—we’re all very familiar at the Fed with the history of the 1960s and ’70s, of course."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,And we know that our job is to achieve 2 percent inflation over time.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’re committed to that, and we will use our tools to do that."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"During this time of reopening, we are likely to see some upward pressure on prices, and I’ll discuss why."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"If, if we see inflation moving materially above 2 percent in a persistent way that risks inflation expectations drifting up, then we will use our tools to guide inflation and expectations back down to 2 percent."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,No one should doubt that we will do that.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,This is not what we expect.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"On, on “largely,” there are a bunch of factors."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,I was really thinking—we were thinking of the base effects and also the energy effects.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,I wasn’t meaning to say there are some real effects.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mean, there are always—there are always relative prices going up and down within inflation."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, there’s a basket for CPI or PCE."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,Relative prices are always moving up and down.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"This, this—we think it’s, it’s very fair to say that the increases we see and, frankly, are about to see later this week are largely due to base effects."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s going to take some time.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"It would have been more contentious to say “entirely due to base effects” because there are some things that are always going up, and so we just said “largely.” MICHELLE SMITH."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Chair Powell."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks for taking our questions.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"Over the past decade, the Fed has invested significant resources in large-scale bank supervision—has completely overhauled that approach."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,And it’s even created a special committee that looks horizontally across the largest banks to find common risks.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,Did the Fed not see that multiple banks had large exposures to Archegos?
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.

2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we have—we’re a long way from our, our goals."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’re 8½ million jobs below where we were in February of 2020, and that doesn’t account for growth in the labor force and growth in the economy, that trend we were on."

2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"Chair Powell, you said a few weeks ago that it would—thank you, Chair Powell."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,You said a few weeks ago that it would take a string of months of job creation of about a million to achieve progress towards your goal.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"Can you define what your, what your definition of “a string of months” is more specifically?"
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, on inflation, the FOMC said the rise in inflation we’re beginning to see largely reflects transitory factors, as you just described."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"But why use the word “largely,” and what are the factors driving higher prices that may not be transitory, based on the initial data that you’re seeing?"
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, what is “a string”?"
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,What do I mean by “a string”?
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"Well, I would say, what we have right now is one really good—I can tell you what it’s not."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s not one really good employment reading, which is what we got in March."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,We got close to a million jobs in March and a very strong labor market reading.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,And I was just suggesting that we’d want to see more like that.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"Why are you confident with, with the lags in monetary policy that the Fed can get ahead of inflation and, and make sure it doesn’t go too far above the 2 percent target?"
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"So my question is, can you tell us, what is different this time versus previous periods like in the ’60s when inflation got out of control?"
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,We will do our job.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you, Michelle, and thank you, Chair Powell, for taking our questions."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, in that sense, it’s good."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, my hope would be that, over time, housing builders can react to this demand and, and come up with more supply and workers will come back to work in that industry."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, you know, it is—it’s not an unalloyed good to have prices going up this much, and we’re watching it very carefully."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"I don’t see the kind of financial stability current concerns, though, that really do reside around the housing sector."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"So many of the financial crackups in all countries, all western countries, that have happened in the last 30 years have been around housing."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,We don’t—we really don’t see that here.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,We don’t see bad loans and unsustainable prices and that kind of thing.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mean, we—it’s part of a strong economy, with people having money to spend and wanting to invest in housing."

2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks for taking my question.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,I wanted to ask about the labor market.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"Do you—do you see things, such as in the Beige Book—you saw in the Beige Book anecdotes about businesses not able to find workers, [inaudible] back to the labor market for fear of getting sick, childcare concerns, and so forth."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,Do you see these as also just sort of temporary bottlenecks that won’t have much effect on the long-term health of the labor market?
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,Or how are you thinking about these kinds of issues?
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"And if you’re—if you’re an entry level housing buyer, this is—this is a problem, because it just is going to be that much harder for people to get that first house, and that’s a problem."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,Inventories are tremendously low.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,RACHEL SIEGEL.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"I wanted to ask you, you know, you’ve been hearing, of course, these concerns raised by Larry Summers and others about inflation and the fact that they think the Fed might be—might let things get out of hand with the new policy stance."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"The housing market in many American cities is seeing booming prices, bidding wars, and all-cash offers well above asking price."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,And this is happening at the same time that housing is becoming much more expensive for lower-income Americans and people who are still struggling from the pandemic.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"Do you have concerns that there are localized housing bubbles or that there’s the potential for that, and what is the Fed doing to monitor or address this?"
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’re, we’re all hearing those stories."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we do monitor the housing market very carefully, of course."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,And one of the main differences was that households were in very good shape financially compared to where they were.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"In addition, most people who got mortgages were people with pretty high credit scores."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"There wasn’t the subprime—you know, low-doc, no-doc lending practices were not there."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,So we don’t have that kind of thing where we have a housing bubble where people are overlevered and owning a lot of houses.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"There’s no question, though, that housing prices are going up, and so we’re watching that carefully."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s, it’s partly because there’s, there’s clearly strong demand, and there’s just not a lot of supply right now."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"So builders are, you know, struggling to keep up with the demand, clearly."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I would say that, before the pandemic, it’s a very different housing market than it was before the Global Financial Crisis."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"Chris, you were breaking up a little there, but I think I did get your question."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s clearly the strongest housing market that we’ve seen since the Global Financial Crisis.

2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,HEATHER SCOTT.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I think there are a number of—a number of things going on there: the tension between a high level of unemployment and yet many, many companies saying they can’t find— an elevated number of companies saying that they can’t find workers."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"Good afternoon, Chair Powell."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"So my guess is, it will come back to this economy where we have, you know, equilibrium between labor supply and labor demand."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"But I do think that—and I do think also that unemployment insurance benefits will run out in September, so to the extent that’s a factor, which is not clear, it will no longer be a factor fairly soon."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"So my guess would be that you will see people coming back into the labor force, and these jobs will be—the labor market will reach equilibrium."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,Maybe pay will go up.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"It, it should be a number of different things."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,There are workers who don’t actually have the specific skills that the employers are looking for.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,There may be geographical differences.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"It, it may also be that, for example, there—one big factor would be, schools aren’t open yet, so there are still people who are at home taking care of their children and would like to be back in the workforce but can’t be yet."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"There are people afraid of—there are virus fears that are weighing on people, so some—some people don’t want to go back to work."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"Now, it’s hard to say whether they will come back in as the labor market strengthens and as COVID, you know, becomes a—in the rearview mirror, in the history books, if you will."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"So—but clearly there’s something going, going on out there, as, as many companies are reporting labor shortages."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,There are also a significant number of people who say they’ve retired—a large number of people that say that they’re retired.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,And we may well start to see that.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"I do think—so what will happen—what we saw during the last expansion, and it may be a different expansion, we don’t know, but, but what we saw was that labor supply generally showed up."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"In other words, if you were worried about there—about running out of workers, it seemed like we never did."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, labor force participation held up."
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,People came in the labor force.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,They stayed in the labor force longer than expected.
2021-04-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"We don’t see wages moving up yet, and presumably we would see that in a real—you know, in a really tight labor market."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we’re, we’re very much attuned to the risks and, and watching the data carefully."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"In the meantime, I would say, you know, we should—as I mentioned earlier, there’s so much uncertainty around this."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s, it’s just a unique situation that we need to see how things evolve in coming months and, and see how that story holds up and act accordingly."

2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thanks, Chair Powell, for taking this."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,I don’t want to miss the moment here.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,And I just—I noticed that in the statement you dropped the language saying that the pandemic is weighing on the economy.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So is this the effective end, in your view, of the pandemic as a constraint on economic activity, even though it’s still cited as a risk?"
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Forecasters have a lot to be humble about.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"What you’ve seen with the pandemic is sharply declining cases, hospitalizations, and deaths."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,HOWARD SCHNEIDER.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, and in that we’re joined by many other forecasters, but there’s a lot to be humble about among forecasters."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"The overall story is one that, that we think is right, and we think the incoming data support it and, you know, so do many, many forecasters."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"We do not expect that, though."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,And that’s great.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"But in terms of, of overcorrecting, I mean, I think there, there is a possibility on the other side of this that, that inflation could be—could actually be quite low going forward."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,But that’s not—that’s not really where our focus is right now.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Our focus right now is, we need to—our, our expectation is that these, these high inflation readings that we’re seeing now will start to abate."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And that’s, that’s what we think."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And it’ll be like the lumber experience, and like we expect the used car experience to be."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"With things like airplane tickets and hotels, which are the other two factors in the most recent CPI report that went up a lot, we expect that those prices will get back up to where they were, but there’s no reason to think that they’re going to keep going up a lot."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,That is not our base case.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Because if they are, people will build new hotels."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,So we think that’ll happen.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think in terms of the timing and the effects on inflation in the near term, there’s a lot of uncertainty."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And if you look at the forecasts on the FOMC, you will—you will see that as well."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"But we don’t—we don’t in any way dismiss the chance that it can work out that, that this goes on longer than expected."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And the risk would be that over time, it does begin to affect inflation expectations."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And if we see inflation expectations and inflation—or inflation moving up in a way that is really materially above what we—what we would see as consistent with our goals, and persistently so, we wouldn’t hesitate to use our tools to address that."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Price stability is half of our mandate, and we would certainly do that."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,There’s no reason for supply and demand to be out of whack in the hotel business over any period of time.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, and, you know, that should continue."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, I know that’s obviously—you know, take that with a grain of salt."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,And it’s—and it’s causing them to have to—to have to react to that.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,We’ve seen growth coming higher than we expected.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,We’ve seen very strong labor demand.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’ve also seen—we have seen inflation above target, though, and I think even though, you know, in, in our forecasters’ case, they do see inflation coming back down over ’22 and ’23 into, into areas that are very consistent with our—with our mandate."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Nonetheless, the risk is, is something that can factor into people’s thinking about appropriate monetary policy."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"The thing is, you know, these are 18 different forecasts, and I can’t stand here and say exactly what was in all 18 people’s minds."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"But that, that is something that I think can factor into things as well—factor into our forecast as well."

2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, you know, you, you also saw in the United Kingdom, which has, I think, at least as high if not higher vaccination rates, they’ve had an outbreak of the Delta variety."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Very strong outcomes in the economy will be achieved.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,I think it’s both.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,So you’re not—you’re not out of the woods at this point.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And it would be premature to—in my thinking, it would be premature to declare victory."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Vaccination still has a ways to go to get to levels—it would be good to see it get to a substantially higher level.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, that can only help."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, look, I—but you’re right, the statement language is evolving."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,I would expect it to continue to evolve.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,There’s a lot of judgment in that.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, I think, clearly, since March what’s happened is, people have grown more confident in these very strong outcomes, that they’ll be achieved."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"But you can expect us to drag our feet a little bit on that, because that’s what you do with statement language."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, again, I would not declare victory yet."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"I would say it is so great to see the reopening of the economy, though, and to see people out living their lives again."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, who doesn’t want to see that?"
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And it appears to be safe, and I just would encourage people to continue to get vaccinated."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,HOWARD SCHNEIDER.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"If I could follow up on that, if you—if you view this statement in, in toto and the—and the dots and the substance as well, do you think this is more a mark-to-market exercise around the improvement in health or around the inflation risks you see developing out there?"
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s, it’s great to see the progress."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,We’re seeing the service sector reopening.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"All the data is pretty—has been pretty roiled by the pandemic, and we’re not really sure where EPOP is going to settle in, we’re not sure where participation is going to settle in."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Incomes are high, people have money in their bank accounts."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"At the same time, we understand this is a different economy."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, the, the demographics are, people are getting older, and that should have a secular effect of, of reducing participation over time."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we have to be sensible about what, what can be done."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,But I think we’re going to be—we’re going to lean into that and be optimistic.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,You asked about wages.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, we’re seeing wage increases."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"That’s, that’s sort of a natural thing to be seeing in a strong economy."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,So we’re all going to be informed by that.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And what we’re seeing is—we don’t see anything that’s troubling in the sense of—what would be troubling would be, you know, very wide across the economy, wages at unsustainable levels without high inflation."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"In other words, wages in excess of productivity and inflation, you know, by a meaningful amount broadly across the economy, sort of forcing companies to keep raising prices and getting into a wage–price cycle."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"That’s, that’s the old formula for—one of the old formulas for having high inflation."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,We don’t see anything like that now.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,We do see high wages.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"We see them for, for people who are mostly new, you know, entering into new jobs, many of them in low-skilled jobs."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, but we, we do think—you’ve got to—you’ve got to think in the labor market right now, where, where supply and demand are just not matched up well."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, we think it’s a flexible economy and, and it will clear."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Chair.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,There will—there will be a level at which supply and demand meet.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, it was quite remarkable."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I think if you—during the last cycle, there were—there were waves of concern that we were reaching full employment as early, you know, as, as 2012, when I arrived at the Fed."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,But that would suggest that you all could theoretically see inflation sustainably staying above 2 percent.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And wages are already looking, you know, decent."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I guess I wonder what full employment means in this context and, and sort of how you’re thinking about those wage data."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Yeah.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"As, as you well know, there isn’t one indicator we can look to, and there’s no one number that we can therefore point to."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"We look at a range of indicators, and it’s a very broad range, you can count to a high number just quickly—but, but, certainly, it will include things like unemployment and participation and wages and many different flavors of that."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know—you know, nine years later— eight years later, we were still creating jobs."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,So how do we think about it?
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’re all going to be informed by what we saw in the last cycle, which was labor supply outperforming expectations over a long period of time."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Now, that hadn’t happened in many other cycles, but this was a very long cycle."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,So we’re going to have to be alert to see whether that can happen again.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,It is a different—it’s a different economy.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"We, we have had a slew of retirements, and that may weigh on participation."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"That, that effect, though, should wear off in a few years and, and, you know, as you move through that window, because they would have—people would have retired anyway, and you’ll be back where you, you would have been."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I think we’re—I think that lesson number one is, is just to be careful about assessing maximum employment."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,A couple of things.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And that’ll—we think that’ll, that’ll be happening in coming months."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So—but the last thing I’ll say is, again, if you look at, at the forecasts, we are going to be in a very strong labor market pretty quickly here."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,There are still a big group of unemployed people.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Sorry, I can’t give you any more."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s just something we’re working on.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Now we’ll go to Anneken Tappe at CNN Business.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,ANNEKEN TAPPE.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Hi there.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"We would also, just to be really clear, we will take whatever actions are necessary to assure that any changes we do make or recommend do not erode the overall strength of bank capital requirements."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks for taking my question.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,And it looks like we’re at the beginning of suppliers catching up with demand.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"But I wonder if you’re worried at all, if we’re going to end up with excess supply immediately after those shortages wear off and if we just continue this mismatch, as we’re recovering and getting out of the pandemic economy."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,And I wonder how that would affect the Fed’s outlook at all.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Well, that is really not the problem we’re having right now."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"But— and, actually, people who work in commodity industries are very focused on that, because they know that, you know, they don’t want to build, build capacity and then find out that it’s not necessary."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, really, the problem now is, is that demand is very, very strong."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Chairman Powell, the price jumps we’ve seen in some raw materials—lumber, for example, you mentioned that earlier—seem to be easing."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we do think it’s appropriate to consider ways to adapt it to this new high-reserves environment, and, and we’re looking hard at the issue."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And because of the substantial increase in reserves, Treasuries, and other safe assets in the banking system, the SLR is rapidly ceasing to become— ceasing to be the intended backstop for big firms that we want it to be."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s a straightforward thing.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, we’re not going to forget about them."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,We’re going—we’re going to do everything we can to get people back into work and give them the chance to work.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"But there’s every reason to think that we’ll be in a—in a labor market with very attractive numbers, with low unemployment, high participation, and rising wages across the spectrum."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So that’s, that’s a little bit how we’re looking at the—at the labor market."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Now we’ll go to Hannah Lang at the American Banker.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,HANNAH LANG.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, I wanted to ask about the status of your thinking around the supplementary leverage ratio right now."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Is the Fed still thinking about ways to permanently adjust this to account for the high growth in deposits?
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,And do you ultimately believe a permanent fix is needed?
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,And any information on the timing around that would be—would be helpful.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"What I can say is, we’re working on it."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"I don’t have anything to share with you in terms of the particulars or the timing right now, unfortunately."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"But we’ve, we’ve always—our position has been for a long time and, and it is now that we’d, we’d like the leverage ratio to be a backstop to risk-based capital requirements."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"When leverage requirements are, are, are binding, it does skew incentives for firms to substitute lower-risk assets for high-risk ones."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Demand for goods is extremely high, and it hasn’t— it hasn’t come down."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And so, I guess my question is, what would be causing that inflation?"
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you, Mr."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,So would that be the result of a tight labor market?
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Another is that you have a long runway, you’ve said, for tapering with announcements."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"But if the data keep coming in faster than expected, are you trapped by fear of a taper tantrum from advancing the time period in which you announce a taper?"
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, finally, you’ve said the Fed knows how to combat inflation, but raising rates also slows the economy."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,And there’s a concern that you might be sacrificing the economy if you wait too long and have to raise rates too quickly.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,So that’s a—that’s a few questions there.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So let me say, first, I think people misinterpret the framework."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,I wanted to get your view on how you square that.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think the—there’s nothing wrong with the framework, and there’s nothing in the framework that would in any way, you know, interfere with our ability to pursue our, our goals."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,All of our discussions and all of our thinking and planning are taking place in the context of our new framework.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’re strongly committed to it, we think it’s well suited to our goals, including in this—in this unique time."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I think if you look at the—look at the forecasts that we’ve written down, you know, our Committee is solidly behind them."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,The forecasts are all consistent with that.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, your specific question, I guess, was, will we be behind the curve?"
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, that’s, that’s not the situation we’re facing at all."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"The situation that we, we addressed in our—in our Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy was a situation in which employment was at very high levels, but inflation was low."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s for starters.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And what we said was, we wouldn’t raise interest rates just because unemployment was low and employment was high if there was no evidence of inflation or other troubling imbalances."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"One is that the new policy framework is that you react to actual data and do not react to forecasts, yet the actual inflation data is coming in hot and you’re relying on the forecast that it will cool down in order to make policy."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Mr. Chairman, of course you’ll be shocked to learn that you have some critics on Wall Street."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, we, it’s—you can’t estimate it with great—with great precision."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think we would be alert to—I mean, studying r* is a—is a whole industry unto itself."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I, I think we would be alert to factors that might raise r*, the neutral rate of interest."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, we, we try to keep up with that."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I think we’re, we’re, we’re all thinking about that and the possibility of that."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, there are many—there are a lot of stories right now that could—that essentially could lead to higher productivity growth and higher r*."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,We don’t know which of those stories will come true.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,And I would like to paraphrase a couple of their criticisms and get your reaction to them.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, I mean, I’ll give you an example."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,And is that going to have that effect?
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,We don’t know.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,But we’ll be watching those things carefully.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Great, thank you."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"For the last question, we’ll go to Michael McKee at Bloomberg TV."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHAEL MCKEE.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s just there are—there are a lot of start-ups, a lot of early-stage companies."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,So that’s what we said.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,That is not at all the current situation.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"In the current situation, we have many millions of people who are unemployed, and we have inflation running well above our target."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,And the history of the Fed is that sometimes you go too far.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s right.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we—look, we have to balance the two—the two goals: maximum employment and price stability."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Often they are—they do pull in the same direction, of course."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"But when we—when we raise interest rates to control inflation, there’s no question that has an effect on activity."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,And that’s the channel—one of the channels through which we get to inflation.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"If you raise rates to control inflation, you also slow the economy."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,We don’t think that we’re in a situation like that right now.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"It turns out it’s a heck of a lot easier to create demand than it is to, you know, to bring supply back up to snuff."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s happening all over the world.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,There’s no reason to think that that process will last indefinitely.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"But we’re going, you know, we’re going to watch carefully to make sure that, that evolving inflation and our understanding of what’s happening is, is, is right."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And in the meantime, we’ll conduct policy appropriately."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"I was wondering if you could follow up a little bit on your response to Rachel at the very beginning and talk a little bit about how we should understand what full employment means in a world that, as you mentioned, is pretty roiled."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"We think that the economy is recovering from a deep hole—an unusual hole, actually, because it’s to do with, with shutting down the economy."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHAEL MCKEE.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,The third thing was—what was the third thing?
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, ultimately, when we achieve our macroeconomic goal, we will—we will taper as appropriate."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,The question we face with this inflation has nothing to do with our framework.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s a very different, very difficult version of a standard investment—sorry, a central banking question."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And that is, how do you separate in inflation—how do you separate things that, that follow from broad upward price pressures from things that really are a function of, of sort of idiosyncratic factors in a particular—due to particular things?"
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mean, a classic example was, to pick a narrow example, was the cellphone price war back in 2017."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"If you remember, there was—prices were incredibly low, and it held down core PCE by three-tenths or something for a year, and then it fell out."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,So this is much bigger than that.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, of course, it’s not—it’s not easy to tell in real time which is which, but that’s, that’s the question you would face under, really, any framework."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, we’re trying to sort that out."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"I’ve tried to, to explain that today about how we think about that."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, we do think that these are temporary factors, and that they’ll wane."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"We can’t be absolutely certain about the timing of that, and we’re prepared to use our tools as appropriate."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Your second one was?
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Oh, you know, we will—we will taper when we feel that the economy has achieved substantial further progress."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,And we will communicate very carefully in advance on that.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,And that’s what we’re doing.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"That’s what we’re going to do, and, and we will follow through on that."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"There’s no—I mean, we will do what we can to avoid a market reaction."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"It would give us more room and, therefore, then, that would tend to result in better outcomes for the economy over time."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"What, what would be—because it seems like you all now see a situation in which inflation would be rising in a way that isn’t caused by transitory factors in the—in the next couple of years."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"A higher neutral rate would, would be—from that narrow standpoint, would be a good thing for us."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And if you look, for example, at the European Central Bank, their, their policy rate was well below zero when, when the pandemic hit."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"They might move up as a consequence of this or, or, or as a consequence of, of, of the new framework."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, we did see inflation expectations moving up in the—in the wake of the announcement of the framework."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, you know, we don’t really know that."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, ultimately, I think it’s consistent with both those things."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Now we’ll go to Greg Robb at MarketWatch.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"But it wouldn’t surprise me if there’s an element for some people in, you know, seeing the inflation performance that we’ve had and thinking that I have more confidence that we could see inflation above 2 percent, that it may not be as hard to do that as we thought, and that inflation expectations may move up to a—to a level—they were—they were really at a level that was kind of a little below 2 percent."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,GREG ROBB.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, thank you for taking my question."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Chair Powell, I’m just looking at the forecast, and one thing I just don’t think has been talked about all that much is how much you guys—the Fed thinks that the economy is going to slow next year."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mean, are we looking at a scenario of a slowing economy next year with higher inflation?"
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, and what do you think about that?"
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’re looking at an economy that will not have the degree of, of fiscal support."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,The fiscal support in the forecast is much less than it was this year.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Hi.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So—but you’ve, you’ve still got a very strong growth, well above the longer-run potential output of the— of the economy."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I’m, I’m a little bit speculating, which I shouldn’t do."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, it’s all in people’s individual thinking, and you can’t—it’s hard to say."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Would that be because this whole situation has raised people’s inflation expectations?
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,How are you thinking about that?
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So what we’re seeing in the near term—again, our base case is that what we’re seeing in the near term is, is principally associated with, with the reopening of the economy and not with a tight labor market or tight resource constraints, really."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,So—but you’re right.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"When, when you get to—in, in the forecast, all of that, you know, supply and demand sides of the economy adapt."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"We have a very highly adaptive, you know, flexible economy, more so than most."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s not something the Committee debates in terms of, you know, what, what the outlook is for 2023."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And by 2023, those increases are really about, about, you know, rising resource utilization or, to put it a different way, you know, low unemployment, or high employment is a way to think about it."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"That’s about the kind of broad inflationary pressure that results from, you know, a really strong expansion tightening up resource utilization across the whole economy and lifting, lifting up inflation."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And that’s why—that’s why you would see it then, because by then, you know, in the forecast—and it’s just a forecast, they’re just individual forecasts."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"In people’s forecasts, that’s what’s happening."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,VICTORIA GUIDA.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So the, the, the change in the projections reflect the fact that you all are more optimistic about the economic outlook, and not necessarily that you think that this will change the way people think about inflation?"
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Yeah, I think—there may be an element of the latter as well, because inflation expectations have continued to move up."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,So that’s what that’s about.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"You’ve got—you’ve got growth meaningfully above that, and inflation is lower next year in all of our—in all of our forecasts."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think the range of, of core PCE forecast for next year is 1.7 to 2.5 in 2022 and, and 2 to 2.3 in 2023."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So you’re right, you’re seeing—I, I can’t remember the number, but it might be in the 3s—3, 3½ percent growth for next year."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And if, if we see inflation moving above our goals in, in a time—sorry, to an extent, to a level or, or persistently—or persistently enough, you know, we would be prepared to use our tools to address that."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Going to Brian Cheung with Yahoo.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,BRIAN CHEUNG.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Chair Powell, Brian Cheung, Yahoo Finance."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"On that point, you talked about maybe some of the more structural changes in that last answer with regards to productivity."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Yes.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"I noted that the median projection for r*, the longer-term interest rate, is still the same at 2.5 percent."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,What would the implications of that be for monetary policy?
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Do you think that maybe the Fed could have the possibility of underestimating the long-run neutral rate?
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,And what might be the impact of that?
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,A higher neutral rate would mean that interest rates would run higher by that amount.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, and that would be a good thing from the standpoint of the economy, because it would give the Fed more room to cut rates."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"The problem with, with interest rates being close to the lower bound, of course, is that it really cuts into our ability to react to a downturn—for example, a pandemic."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"But there’s been some literature out there that maybe the COVID crisis could have actually changed some of the underlying fundamentals of the economy and maybe changed productivity, in addition to combined with demographic changes that have already been in effect to suggest that that longer-term neutral rate or r* might be higher."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Nonetheless, is there a risk that inflation will remain higher than we—than we thought?"
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, when we get through this, we may well—we’ll be facing those same forces."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,All that’s out there still.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"That’s, that’s a really good year—coming on the back of a 7 percent growth year, that’s a really good year."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"That’s, that’s a year with a lot of momentum."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"That’ll see—you know, that’ll cause significant job creation and, and it will—I mean, we would take 3½ percent."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,We didn’t have a 3½ percent growth year—we didn’t have a 3 percent growth year between the Global Financial Crisis and the end of the expansion.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,So that would be a good year.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,GREGG ROBB.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Doesn’t it seem like there’s a risk of, of, you know, like stagflation— where that—you’re going to go from 7 percent and down, that means the economy’s really, you know, dropping in some way."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"We haven’t seen that, right?"
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Well, the economy’s not, not decel—the economy is still growing, and growing at a, at a very healthy rate."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Our estimate—I mean, different people have different estimates—but, broadly speaking, economists think the economy has the potential to grow at around 2 percent per year."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"If you’re growing above that, then the unemployment rate should be declining, people should be being pulled into the labor force, wages should be going up, lots of things should be happening, businesses should be investing."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, you know, I guess to answer your question a different way, is there a risk that inflation will be higher than we think?"
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Yes.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"As I said earlier, you know, we, we don’t have any certainty about the timing or the extent of these effects from reopening."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,And therefore we don’t—we don’t think that—we think it’s unlikely that they would materially affect the underlying inflation dynamics that the economy has had for a quarter of a century.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"The underlying forces around the globe that have created those dynamics are intact, and those are aging population, low productivity, globalization, all of those things that, that we think have, have, you know, really held down inflation."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,So we don’t want to be in a place where we can’t react.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you for taking our questions.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,And do you believe that the changes in the Fed’s rate control toolkit today will have any impact on that?
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,JEANNA SMIALEK.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,And so I think we have to be humble about our ability to understand the data.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s not a time to try to reach hard conclusions about the labor market, about inflation, about the path of policy."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,We need to see more data.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,We need to be a little bit patient.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I do think, though, that we’ll, we’ll, we’ll be seeing some things coming up in coming months that will—that will inform our, our thinking."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we, we really don’t have a template or, or, you know, any experience of, of a situation like this."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Paul Kiernan.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Chairman Powell."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks for the question.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Your—the Committee’s median forecast on inflation seems to assume a pretty, pretty tame outlook for the rest of the year."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"As you know, the three-month annualized rate for the past three months was, I think, 8.4 percent in the CPI."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I’m just wondering sort of how much longer we can sustain those, those kinds of rates before you get nervous."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,PAUL KIERNAN.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,So inflation has come in above expectations over the last few months.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"I will also say, though, the last thing I’ll say is, this is an extraordinarily unusual time."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,So you would think that that would add to an increase in job creation as well.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"There are very large amounts of job openings, and there are a very large number of people who, who are unemployed."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And the pace of, of filling those jobs is—somehow feels slower than it might be."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I’d point to a number of things, the first of which is just that most of the, the act of sort of going back to one’s old job—that’s kind of already happened."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,So this is a question of people finding a new job.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,And that’s just a process that takes longer.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,There may be something of a speed limit on it.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"You’ve got to find a job where, where your skills match what, you know, what, what the employer wants."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So you put all those together, I would expect that we would see strong job creation building up over the summer and going into—going into the fall."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s got to be in the right area.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So that’s, that’s sort of a natural thing."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"In addition, I would say that we, we look at, for example, a, a significant number of people still say that they’re concerned about going back to work in jobs where there’s a lot of public facing because of—because of COVID."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So that’s clearly holding back some people, and that should diminish as vaccinations move ahead."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,There’s also the question of childcare.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Many are engaged in, in caretaking."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And as schools reopen and, and, and childcare/daycare centers open in the fall—in the fall, then we should see—we should see that supporting labor force participation by caretakers."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Finally, unemployment insurance for something like 15 million people will either end or be diminished as we move through the summer and into, into, into the fall by the end of September, and I’d like some—that may also encourage some to go back in and take jobs."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,There’s just a lot that goes into the function of finding a job.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"In terms of the near term, you ask as well—so we see a couple of things, a few things that seem likely to be holding back labor supply."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"But if you look behind the headline numbers, you’ll see that the incoming data are, are consistent with the view that prices—that prices that are driving that higher inflation are from categories that are being directly affected by the recovery from the pandemic and the reopening of the economy."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"The thought is that prices like that that have moved up really quickly because of the shortages and bottlenecks and the like, they should stop going up, and at some point, they, they, in some cases, should actually go down."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Now we’ll go to Ylan Mui at CNBC.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,YLAN MUI.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Hi.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you, Chair Powell, for doing this."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"My question for you is that you mentioned that your colleagues did have a discussion about the progress that you’re making toward your, your goals in order to consider tapering your asset purchases."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"In that discussion, you said that you didn’t—haven’t made substantial progress yet, but that you expect to continue to make progress."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"In that discussion, did you guys talk about a timeline for when you expect to see that progress be made and when you might consider starting to reduce those purchases?"
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I, I expect that we’ll be able to say more about timing as we see more data."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Basically, there’s not a lot of more light I can—I can shed on that."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"But you can think of this meeting that we had as the “talking about talking about” meeting, if you like."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I now suggest that we retire that term, which has—which has served its purpose well, I think."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So Committee participants were of the view that since we adopted that guidance in December, the economy has clearly made progress, although we are still a ways from our goal of substantial further progress."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Participants expect continued progress ahead toward that objective.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And assuming that is the case, it will be appropriate to consider announcing a plan for reducing our asset purchases at a future meeting."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Right.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, for example, the experience with, with lumber prices is, is illustrative of this."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"If you look at the—if you look at the forecast for 2021 and—sorry, 2022 and 2023 among my colleagues on the, on the Federal Open Market Committee, you will see that people do expect inflation to move down meaningfully toward our goal."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,And we did see that in the case of lumber.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Another example where we haven’t seen that yet is prices for used cars, which accounted for more than a third of the total increase in core inflation."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Used car prices are going up because of sort of a perfect storm of very strong demand and limited supply.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s going up at just an amazing annual rate.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"But we do think that it makes sense that that would stop, and that in fact it would reverse over time."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,So we think we’ll be seeing some of that.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,When will we be seeing it?
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I think the full range of, of, of inflation projections for 2023 falls between 2 and 2.3 percent, which is consistent with our—with our goals."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,We’re not sure.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"But over time, it seems likely that these very specific things that are driving up inflation will be—will be temporary."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we’ll be, you know, we’re going to be looking."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,We’ll be looking at the monthly pricing data.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"I’ll, I’ll also say that the labor market is going to be important, both for the maximum- employment goal, but also for inflation."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,And we’ll be looking at that.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, and as I—as I mentioned, we expect and I expect that we’ll see increases in supply over coming months as the factors that we believe have been suppressing supply abate, wane, move down."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I, I can’t give you an exact number or an exact time, but I would say that we do expect inflation to move down."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"That narrative seems, still seems quite likely to prove correct, although, you know, as I pointed out at the last press conference, the, the timing of that is, is pretty uncertain, and so are the, the effects in the near term."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"But overall, this is—this is going to be, you know, a very strong labor market."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And so we, we don’t actually know exactly what labor force participation will be as we go forward, but I, I would tend to, to look at it and think that it—that it can return to high levels, although it may take some time to do that."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"At the same time, we have seen—in terms of participation, we’ve seen a significant number of, of people retire."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Looking ahead, FOMC participants project the labor market to continue to improve, with the median projection for the unemployment rate standing at 4.5 percent at the end of this year and declining to 3.5 percent by the end of 2023."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"The economic downturn has not fallen equally on all Americans, and those least able to shoulder the burden have been hardest hit."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"In particular, despite progress, joblessness continues to fall disproportionately on lower-wage workers in the service sector and on African Americans and Hispanics."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Inflation has increased notably in recent months.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,The 12-month change in PCE prices was 3.6 percent in April and will likely remain elevated in coming months before moderating.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Part of the increase reflects the very low readings from early in the pandemic falling out of the calculation as well as the pass-through of past increases in oil prices to, to consumer energy prices."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Beyond these effects, we are also seeing upward pressure on prices from the rebound in spending as the economy continues to reopen, particularly as supply bottlenecks have limited how quickly production in some sectors can respond in the near term."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"These factors should wane in coming months against a backdrop of rising vaccinations, leading to more rapid gains in employment."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"These bottleneck effects have been larger than anticipated, and FOMC participants have revised up their projections for, for inflation notably for this year."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"The process of reopening the economy is unprecedented, as was the shutdown at the onset of the pandemic."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"As the reopening continues, shifts in demand can be large and rapid, and bottlenecks, hiring difficulties, and other constraints could continue to limit how quickly supply can adjust, raising the possibility that inflation could turn out to be higher and more persistent than we expect."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Our new framework for monetary policy emphasizes the importance of having well-anchored inflation expectations, both to foster price stability and to enhance our ability to promote our broad-based and inclusive maximum-employment goal."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Indicators of longer-term inflation expectations have generally reversed the declines seen earlier in the pandemic and have moved into a range that appears broadly consistent with our longer-run inflation goal of 2 percent.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"If we saw signs that the path of inflation or longer-term inflation expectations were moving materially and persistently beyond levels consistent with our goal, we’d be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,The pandemic continues to pose risks to the economic outlook.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Progress on vaccinations has limited the spread of COVID-19 and will likely continue to reduce the effects of the public health crisis on the economy.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"As these transitory supply effects abate, inflation is expected to drop back toward our longer-run goal, and the median inflation projection falls from 3.4 percent this year to 2.1 percent next year and 2.2 percent in 2023."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"However, the pace of vaccinations has slowed, and new strains of the virus remain a risk."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Factors related to the pandemic, such as caregiving needs, ongoing fears of the virus, and unemployment insurance payments, appear to be weighing on employment growth."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Employment in this sector and the economy as a whole remains well below pre- pandemic levels.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hey, Chair Powell."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Good afternoon.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"At the Federal Reserve, we are strongly committed to achieving the monetary policy goals that Congress has given us: maximum employment and price stability."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Today the Federal Open Market Committee kept interest rates near zero and maintained our asset purchases.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"These measures, along with our strong guidance on interest rates and on our balance sheet, will ensure that monetary policy will continue to deliver powerful support to the economy until the recovery is complete."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Widespread vaccinations, along with unprecedented fiscal policy actions, are also providing strong support to the recovery."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Indicators of economic activity and employment have continued to strengthen, and real GDP this year appears to be on track to post its fastest rate of increase in decades."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"The unemployment rate remained elevated in May at 5.8 percent, and this figure understates the shortfall in employment, particularly as participation in the labor market has not moved up from the low rates that have prevailed for most of the past year."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Much of this rapid growth reflects the continued bounceback in activity from depressed levels.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Household spending is rising at a rapid pace, boosted by the ongoing reopening of the economy, fiscal support, and accommodative financial conditions."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"The housing sector is strong, and business investment is increasing at a solid pace."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"In some industries, near- term supply constraints are restraining activity."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Forecasts from FOMC participants for economic growth this year have been revised up since our March Summary of Economic Projections.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Even so, the recovery is incomplete, and risks to the economic outlook remain."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"As with overall economic activity, conditions in the labor market have continued to improve, although the pace of improvement has been uneven."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Employment rose 419,000 per month, on average, in April and May, with the leisure and hospitality sector continuing to post notable gains."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,The sectors most adversely affected by the pandemic remain weak but have shown improvement.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Continued progress on vaccinations will support a return to more normal economic conditions.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"The Fed’s policy actions have been guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people, along with our responsibilities to promote the stability of the financial system."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"As the Committee reiterated in today’s policy statement, with inflation having run persistently below 2 percent, we will aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time so that inflation averages 2 percent over time and longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2 percent."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Rachel Siegel, the Washington Post."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,RACHEL SIEGEL.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you, Michelle, and thank you, Chair Powell, for taking our questions."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"I’m wondering if you can walk us through expectations you have, specifically when it comes to the labor market going into 2023."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I’m curious about people who may have left the labor market, who have yet to come back, or who may face issues with childcare."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Perhaps they’ve retired early.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Any barriers that you see in keeping people from the labor market as you consider full employment going into 2023?
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I would say, if you look at the labor market and you look at the demand for workers and the level of job creation and think ahead, I think it’s clear, and I am confident, that we are on a path to a very strong labor market—a labor market that, that shows low unemployment, high participation, rising wages for people across the spectrum."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mean, I think that’s, that’s shown in our projections, it’s shown in outside projections."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And if you look through the current time frame and think one and two years out, we’re going to be looking at a very, very strong labor market."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"In terms of exactly what that means, we’ll, we’ll have to see how things evolve."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think we learned during the course of the last very long expansion, the longest in our history, that labor supply during a long expansion can exceed expectations, can move above its estimated trend."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, and I have no reason to think that that won’t happen again."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,I look forward to your questions.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,We at the Fed will do everything we can to support the economy for as long as it takes to complete the recovery.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,We expect to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until these employment and inflation outcomes are achieved.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"With regard to interest rates, we continue to expect that it will be appropriate to maintain the current 0 to ¼ percent target range for the federal funds rate until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee’s assessment of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"As is evident in the SEP, many participants forecast that these favorable economic conditions will be met somewhat sooner than previously projected; the median projection for the appropriate level of the federal funds rate now lies above the effective lower bound in 2023."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Of course, these projections do not represent a Committee decision or plan, and no one knows with any certainty where the economy will be a couple of years from now."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"More important than any forecast is the fact that, whenever liftoff comes, policy will remain highly accommodative."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Reaching the conditions for liftoff will mainly signal that the recovery is strong and no longer requires holding rates near zero.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"In addition, we are continuing to increase—continuing to increase our holdings of Treasury securities by at least $80 billion per month and of agency mortgage-backed securities by at least $40 billion per month until substantial further progress has been made toward our maximum-employment and price-stability goals."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,The increase in our balance sheet since March 2020 has materially eased financial conditions and is providing substantial support to the economy.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"At our meeting that concluded earlier today, the Committee had a discussion on the progress made toward our goals since the Committee adopted its asset purchase guidance last December."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"While reaching the standard of “substantial further progress” is still a ways off, participants expect that progress will continue."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"In coming meetings, the Committee will continue to assess the economy’s progress toward our goals."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"As we have said, we will provide advance notice before announcing any decision to make changes to our purchases."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"On a final note, we made a technical adjustment today to the Federal Reserve’s administered rates."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,The IOER and overnight RRP rates were adjusted upward by 5 basis points in order to keep the federal funds rate well within the target range and to support smooth functioning in money markets.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,This technical adjustment has no bearing on the appropriate path for the federal funds rate or stance of monetary policy.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"To conclude, we understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Everything we do is in service to our public mission.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So at coming meetings, the Committee will continue to assess the economy’s progress toward our goals, and we’ll give advance notice before announcing any decision."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"The timing, of course, Ylan, will depend on the pace of that progress and not on any calendar."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Transcript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference June 16, 2021 CHAIR POWELL."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Does the Committee have one?
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And if not, why not?"
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And if they don’t, why isn’t this just flexible inflation targeting without an average in a range of 2 to 2¼ percent?"
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, so as part of our year-and-a-half-long process, the review that we did and came out with at the end of that with the—with the new Statement on Longer- Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, we looked carefully at the idea."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,We’ve all read all the literature around different formulas for makeup and things like that.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,So what is your look-back period?
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we concluded—and, you know, I strongly agree—that it’s not wise to, to wed yourself to a particular formulation of that."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, it says that we will seek to—seek inflation that runs moderately above 2 percent for some time."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And it’s, it’s meant to create a broad sense that we want inflation to average 2 percent over time."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And that under the old—under the old formula, under the old framework, what was happening was, 2 percent was a ceiling because all of the errors were below."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,You were always getting back to 2 percent.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So you were bouncing back and forth between 1½ and 2, and we wanted them to be centered around 2."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, so that’s, that’s the approach that we’re taking."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,So we did adopt a discretionary—there’s an element of discretion in it.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,We were clear on that when we announced the framework.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Or does it plan to suppress inflation in outer years because, over the next three years, you’re going to be above inflation?"
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"If I were a businessman looking at the forecast today, I would ask how and when the Fed seeks to achieve an average of 2 percent inflation."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And so all I can say is that we, we think it’s important—we think where the balance sheet’s concerned, a lot of notice, as much transparency as we can give, and as far—as far in advance as we can to give people a chance to adjust their expectations."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, we expect to be in that business until we reach substantial further progress and then have a—have a decision."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Again, I have nothing further on time."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,It wouldn’t be appropriate to say.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,We’re going to have to see more data.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’re a ways away from substantial further progress, we think."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,But we’re making progress.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"In other words, does the FOMC have a look-back period?"
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Again, as we—as we approach that goal, we’ll provide, you know, as much clarity as we can."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Great, thank you."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Going to Craig Torres at Bloomberg.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,CRAIG TORRES.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Craig Torres at Bloomberg.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,So you can’t say generally how far in advance you would signal?
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, as I mentioned, we’ll, we’ll give advance notice before announcing a decision to taper."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Was there another part of your question, Craig?"
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"That pretty much answers it, Chair Powell."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,It could have some impact.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,I think we’ll have to see empirically.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"But it’s designed to keep the federal funds rate, you know, within the range."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I do think it could have some effect on, on broader money market conditions below as it relates to, you know, the very low rates and the downward pressures."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHAEL DERBY.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And will it—do think it will lower uptake on the reverse repo facility, or that’s just not even really a focus of what the change was?"
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s not, honestly."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s, it’s possible that that would not be the case."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s going to be an empirical question.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHAEL DERBY.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Okay, cool."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’ll go to Jeanna Smialek, the New York Times."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, the funny thing, you would think that it would, but we’ll have to see."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,CRAIG TORRES.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Will that have any impact on money market conditions that, you know, beyond the fed funds rate setting?"
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHAEL DERBY.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Now we’ll go to Michael Derby.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHAEL DERBY.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks for taking my question.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,So I wanted to ask you about the reverse repo usage that we’ve seen lately.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Yeah, I mean, the change in the rate control toolkit, will that have any impact on—do you think that will reduce the, the amount of money coming into reverse repos?"
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,I was curious if you are at all concerned about the level of money flowing into the reverse repo facility.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So on the—on the facility, we think it’s doing its job."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"We think it’s doing—the reverse repo facility is, is doing what it’s supposed to do, which is to provide a floor under money market rates and keep the federal funds rate well within its—well within its range."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,So we’re not concerned with it.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s doing—you have an unusual situation where the Treasury General Account is, is shrinking and bill supply is shrinking."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And so there’s, there’s downward pressure—we’re buying assets—there’s downward pressure on short-term rates, and that facility is, is doing what we think it’s supposed to do."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Sorry, your second question was again?"
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And then, in a related question, do you think that Fed asset purchases are taking too many safe assets out of the market right now and creating maybe some dislocations in the money markets?"
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,And we’ll try to be clear.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And you’re right, it’s not—it’s not a formulaic approach."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So our intention for this process is that it will be orderly, methodical, and transparent."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So it’s, it’s good, actually, to see inflation—longer-term inflation expectations move back up to a range—it’s a range that’s consistent with what our objectives are."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And that’s why we look at a broad range of them and tend to look at the movement of that broad range of, of, of indicators, which are from, you know, surveys of economists, surveys of the public, and also market based."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s, it’s, it’s a wide index, as I’m sure you know."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"We look at that, and we see them back in the range where they were."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, by the way, they’ve been broadly higher than that, somewhat modestly higher than that, not so many years ago, at a time when inflation was, was, was still anchored at around 2 percent or maybe even a little bit below."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So the answer is, yes, I think they are anchored and they’re at a good place right now."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s gratifying to see them having moved up off of their pandemic lows.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,So that was a concern.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, as you know, it’s, it’s fundamental in our framework, our new framework, to, to assure that inflation—longer-term inflation expectations are anchored at a place that is consistent with our goal."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"If, if inflation expectations are not anchored at a place that’s consistent with your goal, it’s not clear why you would expect to hit your goal over the longer term."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,So it’s important.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMTH.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Okay, now we’ll go to James Politi with the FT. JAMES POLITI."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Chair Powell—thanks, Chair Powell."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Your economic projections today forecast 7 percent growth in 2022, unemployment at 4½ percent, and core inflation of 3 percent."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"If those conditions are achieved by the end of the year, would that constitute substantial further progress, in your mind?"
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"We, we think that’s an important reason."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And kind of more broadly, when you look at the sort of median forecast for interest rates in 2023 showing not one but two interest rate increases at the time, I mean, is this kind of—can you describe the sort of tone of the—of the discussion in the Committee?"
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"They moved down during the beginning of the pandemic, you know, sort of further exacerbating concerns that we might find ourselves where, for example, the ECB and the Bank of Japan have been, where you have expectations and inflation itself sliding down and you have a really hard time stopping that process once it begins."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, and that’s, that’s maybe not a good signal for future inflation if, if gas happens to spike and then go back down again."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Now we’ll go to Chris Rugaber, AP."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I can just tell you, we, we, we see real value in communicating well in advance what our thinking is."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,CHRIS RUGABER.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Right.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Well, you mentioned—let me ask about inflation expectations."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,You said they were—I think you mentioned in your opening statement that you saw them as within target.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we—yes, I think if, if you look at the broad range of longer-term inflation expectations, they’ve moved up."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Does that mean that some of the shorter-term measures we’ve seen out there such as the New York Federal Reserve’s three-year outlook, which jumped a bit—should those sort of be dismissed?"
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,And would you describe those as still well anchored at this point?
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And on a related note, would the Fed consider publishing its index of common inflation expectations on a monthly basis?"
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we, we do tend to look at the longer-term inflation expectations, because that’s really, we think, what matters for, for inflation."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So and, and, you know, the shorter-term ones do tend to move around based on, for example, gasoline prices."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So you’ll see if gasoline prices were to spike, you’ll see the shorter-term inflation expectation measures, particularly the surveys, move up."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,And are we only looking at longer-term inflation expectations?
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,And are we really moving towards sort of a post-pandemic stance?
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"These are not precise measures, and that’s—and they, they contain risk premiums of various kinds."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,And that would be a welcome development.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"If such outcomes materialize, it means the economy will have made faster progress toward our goals."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So the other thing I’ll say is, rate increases are really not at all the focus of the Committee."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,The focus of the Committee is the current state of the economy.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"But in terms of our tools, it’s about asset purchases."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s what we’re thinking about.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Liftoff is, is well into the future."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"The conditions for liftoff—we’re very far from maximum employment, for example."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s, it’s a consideration for the future."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So the near-term thing is really—the real near-term discussion, discussion that will begin is really about the, the path of asset purchases."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, as I mentioned, we had a discussion about that today and expect to, in future meetings, continue to think about our progress."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,We’ll go to Nancy Marshall-Genzer from Marketplace.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Is there greater confidence that, you know, the recovery will be, you know, a full recovery sooner than expected?"
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, honestly, the main message I would take away from the SEP is that participants—many, many participants are more comfortable that the economic conditions in the Committee’s forward guidance will be met somewhat sooner than previously anticipated."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"In the projections, it gives some sense of how participants see the economy evolving in their most likely case."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Continuing—Chair Powell, continuing in that vein, when you’re ready, how will you go about signaling the start of tapering when you do decide to do that?"
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And it’s outcome based, it’s not time based."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, as I mentioned, it’s labor market conditions consistent with maximum employment, inflation at 2 percent and on track to exceed 2 percent."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"On your first question, the judgment of when we have arrived at substantial further progress is one that the Committee will make."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,And it would not be appropriate for me to lay out particular numbers that do or do not—that do or do not qualify.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"That is—that is, you know, the process that we’re beginning now at the next meeting."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"We will begin, meeting by meeting, to, to assess that progress and talk about what we—what we think we’re seeing and, and just do all of the things that you do to sort of clarify your thinking around the process of deciding whether and how to adjust the pace and composition of asset purchases."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"In terms of the, the, the two hikes—so let me say a couple things first of all, not for the first time, about the—about the dot plot."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"They’re not a Committee forecast, they’re not a plan."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we did not actually have a discussion of whether liftoff is appropriate at any particular year, because discussing liftoff now would be— would be highly premature, wouldn’t make any sense."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"These are, of course, individual projections."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Often they don’t.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And the last thing to say is, the dots are not a great forecaster of, of future rate moves."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,And that’s not because—it’s just because it’s so highly uncertain.
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"There is no great forecaster of, of future dots."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, so dots to be taken with a—with a big, big grain of salt."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"However, so let me talk about this, this, this meeting."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"The Committee spelled out, as you know, in our FOMC statements the conditions that it expects to see before an adjustment in the target range is made."
2021-06-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"If you look at the transcripts from five years ago, you’ll see that sometimes people mention their rate path in their interventions."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, today, I’ve, I’ve given you what I can give you because, again, this, this was the first, really, I would say, deep dive on the issues of timing, pace, and composition."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"There’s a range of views on, on what timing will be appropriate."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"And those views ultimately track, track back to people’s views about the economy and, and what will happen as we make progress towards, towards our—towards our goal."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"So that’s, that’s really what it is."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I, I—we will, of course, as we—you know, we’re going to continue to try to provide clarity as appropriate on, on timing, pace, and composition."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"All I’m saying is, is, we’re not at substantial further progress."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,And it was a good meeting.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I am going to give a speech, and—but I, I, I wouldn’t want to—I wouldn’t want to say what will be in there at this point."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,I—but I will say we’re making progress.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,We expect further progress.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we expect that, if, if things go well, then we will—we will reach that goal."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"And when we reach it and the Committee is comfortable that we have reached it, then, then we’ll taper at that point."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"I can’t, I really—there’s nothing I can say about Jackson Hole."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, I’m in—we’re in the process of writing that speech."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHAEL MCKEE.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"And—but no decisions are made, and, and I’m just not in a position to, to give you much guidance, really any guidance, on the actual timing."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"So in any decisions about the timing, and I did not—if I—if I said we’re looking at wanting a couple more months of data, I wasn’t—I’m not meaning to suggest anything about a particular time at which we might taper, because we really have not made that decision."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,We’ll go to Michael McKee at Bloomberg TV.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"Is that—is that the plan, or are we not going to see anything until the fall?"
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"Well, if I could follow up, several people have recently noted that the Fed has got the markets working well."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,And so we’ve got to be very careful about that.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, but I, I, I think it’s a good point that it’s, it’s a term—what it really means is temporary."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,But then you’ve got to understand that it doesn’t mean that the—that the increases will be taken back.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"Some of them will be, but, but that’s not really what it means."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"In terms of—so we’re, we’re working virtually here, and we’ll be coming back down the road in a couple of months, starting to bring people back here at the Board of Governors in Washington."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, we’re going to follow public health guidance and things like that."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,We really haven’t made the fundamental decisions about exactly what that will look like.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHAEL MCKEE.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"Chairman, I wanted to ask you a little bit about your taper timeline in the sense that you said you want a couple more months of data."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"And the statement says that the Fed is going to use—to, to evaluate the developments in the two markets, in jobs and inflation, in coming meetings."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,Does that suggest that we wouldn’t see anything before September or November in your meetings?
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,And I know a lot of people on Wall Street have basically felt you’re going to lay out your taper plans at Jackson Hole.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"And it’ll depend on, to some extent, on what—on what, you know, CDC guidance looks like when we actually do bring people back in."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,And you’ve got bank loans up.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,We’ll go to Chris Rugaber at the AP.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"But savers and companies, like insurance companies and pension funds, are getting hammered by the low rates."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"Well, I think strong capital requirements are essential for banks, particularly for the largest banks."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I think that an undercapitalized banking system, as we’ve seen, can be a real threat to the economy and most—mostly, or to, to the greatest extent, to people at the lower end of the income spectrum."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"So if you look back at not this previous—not this crisis but the previous one, the bank—the banking system was undercapitalized."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"So higher capital requirements are, are, you know, are, are really a good thing because they allow banks to weather downturns and continue to perform the functions that they perform."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think it’s other tools that we have to—and the Fed has some of these tools, Congress has some of these tools, other agencies have some of these tools—to assure or support the wide availability of credit, particularly to low- and moderate-income communities."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,So that’s CRA.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,We enforce CRA.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s also the anti—anti– lending discrimination statutes that we enforce.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,And it’s some of the programs that Congress has in place to support the flow of credit to low- and moderate-income communities.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"I, I don’t think it’s capital standards at all."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,I think capital standards work the other way.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"Strong capital is what enables banks to continue to serve their communities, including low- and moderate-income communities."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’re working on a—on a new CRA proposal right now with the other banking agencies, and we think it’s going to be—it’s going to be good and will support the flow of credit to low- and moderate-income households."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"In other words, you’ve stimulated demand."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"Basically, is it possible to achieve the balance of a safe banking system with one that also provides equitable loan access?"
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,Hi.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,And they’re wondering if the balance hasn’t started to shift away from benefiting the economy to doing more harm than good.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,We—asset purchases were just a key part of our response to the critical phase of the crisis.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"They, they really helped us restore market function to these key markets, really, on which—on which, which are very, very important to our economy and the global economy."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"And then they were a big part of, of creating accommodative financial conditions to support demand."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,They were strongly needed.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"It was that commitment to continue asset purchases that provided strong support for the economy and, and has been a part of the story for why the economy is so strong right now."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"You’ve been asked a lot previously if the Fed’s monetary policy at all contributes to inequality, but I was really curious to know where you think the Fed’s regulatory policy lands, particularly if you think that the Fed’s bank capital requirements have had the effect of penalizing lower-income households seeking loans."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,So we said we would taper when we—when we achieve substantial further progress.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mean, it’s—and, and, again, we’re talking about it right now and meeting by meeting and, and moving in that direction."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,We will taper when we reach that goal.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we’ll provide more, you know, more clarity on that as we go, as is appropriate."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,We’ll go to Hannah Lang at the American Banker.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,HANNAH LANG.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, and, you know, we’re going to honor that commitment."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"Price stability, for us, means inflation averaging 2 percent over time."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"It may take some time, though."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,All the evidence is that it’s not happening.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"People—what’s happened is, first of all, many people are vaccinated."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,They’re going on with their lives.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"Secondly, we’ve kind of learned to live with it."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"A lot of industries have, have kind of improvised their way around it—particularly, for example, buying a new home."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"That, that process of buying a new home very quickly moved to much more of a virtual process."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"And so they were able to, you know, to, to do that."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"And other industries as well have gone to take-out and, you know, no-contact things."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"And it was much less than, than people thought."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s—so that can all—it seems like we’ve learned to, to handle this."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I, I, I hope to some extent, we will over time."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, of course, the big wave we had last winter did have significant employment effects, particularly in, you know, hospitality and leisure and other entertainment—other, other areas with a lot of direct contact."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"A lot of jobs were lost then because that was a very strong wave that happened in, in, in the winter months last year, just before the vaccines arrived."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"So with Delta, we’re just going to have to watch."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"Again, with, with, with a reasonably high percentage of the country vaccinated and the vaccine apparently being effective—we’re not experts on this—but it, it seems like the—a good—a good going-in estimate would be that the effects will probably be less."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,There probably won’t be significant lockdowns and things like that.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, again, those, those are not decisions for us or, or, or—nor is it something we’re be— we’d be expert in."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"Now, I think people would like to get back to, to, you know, the way things were."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"In terms of the, the, the channels, you know, I—this is—this is kind of speculation, but it’s pretty—it just is that people, you could imagine school districts deciding to wait a month or two for the—for the—for the Delta wave to go."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"And then this big second wave hit, and I think the natural thing to do is to expect that, that it would have a real impact on the economy."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"So if you remember the, the summer wave last year of COVID, which was largely southern and western states, the economy just performed much better than anyone expected."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, generally speaking, Americans want to work, and, and they’ll find their way into the jobs that they want."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,CHRISTOPHER RUGABER.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,Rachel Siegel at the Washington Post.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,RACHEL SIEGEL.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you, Michelle."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, we, we were coming off the spring wave, where there were a lot of shutdowns."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"And thank you, Chair Powell, for taking our questions."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,Could you elaborate on what you’ve seen to that end during previous waves?
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"And then, looking forward, how vulnerable is the labor market to the Delta variant?"
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,I’m thinking or wondering if you have concerns that jobs that may have come back in travel or tourism could be susceptible if people started reconsidering their travel plans or if caretakers were suddenly faced with the prospect of schools not reopening.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,How do you see some of those risks going forward?
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you so much.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,Sure.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,I wanted to follow up on what you said about there tending to be less in the way of economic implications from each wave of COVID cases.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"I’m not saying this’ll happen, but that it’s easy to imagine that."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s also easy to imagine that some people might say, you know what?"
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,I’m just going to—I’m just going to wait a couple of months before going back to work.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,The concept of “transitory” is really this: It is that the increases will happen.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,We’re not saying they will reverse.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s not what “transitory” means.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"It means that the increases in prices will happen, so there will be inflation but that the process of inflation will stop so that—so that there won’t be further—when, when we think of inflation, we really think of inflation going up year upon year upon year upon year."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s inflation.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"When you have inflation for 12 months or whatever it might be—I’m just taking an example; I’m not making an estimate—then, then you have a price increase, but you don’t have an inflation process."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"And so part of that just is that, if it doesn’t affect longer-term inflation expectations, then it’s very likely not to infect—to affect the process of inflation going forward."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"So what, what I mean by “transitory” is just something that doesn’t leave a permanent mark on the inflation process."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"That’s, that’s not the idea."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s just that they won’t go on indefinitely.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"So to the extent people are, are, are implementing price increases because raw materials are going up or labor costs or something’s going up, you know, the question, really, for inflation really is, does that mean they’re going to go up the next year by the same amount?"
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"So you’re going to be in a process where inflation, the inflation process, gets going."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, and that happens because people’s expectations about future inflation move up."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,And we don’t think that’s happening.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,There’s no evidence that it’s happening.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"Again, we don’t mean—I don’t mean that, that, that, that, you know, producers are going to take those price increases back."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,And I wonder if that’s something that you would like to see or expect to see Systemwide going forward.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,And your colleague in Minneapolis has placed a mandate on vaccinating employees coming back to that Federal Reserve Bank.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, and quickly as well, you’ve talked about vaccines a bit."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,Wouldn’t be hard to imagine that happening.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"If, if schools don’t open, then caretakers have to stay home."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"And if people don’t go back into the labor force, then the job growth won’t be as strong, those kinds of things."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I don’t—it doesn’t—it doesn’t—again, sitting here today, not being able to really know the future—it doesn’t seem as though the effects will be very large."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,But there may be effects.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,And they—it may be that the effect is to slow the economy down just for a period of months—or not.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"There are many parts of the country where it might not have an effect, and we’re just going to have to, to see what the economic effects are."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,Now we’ll go to David Gura at NPR.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,DAVID GURA.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"I was going to ask if you’ve started drafting your Jackson Hole speech, but I’m going to go in a—in a different direction here."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,Steve Liesman asked you about semantics.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"I’m going to take a cue from him and ask you about the term “transitory,” because I think of you as somebody who’s so lucidly explained policies and programs in recent months and made a real concerted effort to explain them to, to the American public as a whole."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"I wonder about this term and what you would say to people who don’t know it definitionally, don’t know what it means, and see prices going up and wonder how long they’re going to have to wait."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,So just some broader definition from you—I’d like to hear just about what it means or how you understand it.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, nonetheless, we have to watch this very carefully because this is—you know, we have two mandates: maximum employment and price stability."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,Hi.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"Not, not really."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"Chair Powell, I guess I wanted to ask about the last—when you were before Congress earlier this month, you mentioned, I think, something along the lines of, it won’t take too long before we see if you’re right about inflation and its temporary aspect."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,This is—this is not that.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"That was the kind of inflation we were thinking about that comes from, you know, from a very, very strong labor market and a—and a booming economy maybe."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"That, that was the kind of inflation—this, this is something different."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"This is really driven by the supply side, which is not able to hand—to handle this big spike in demand that we’re seeing."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"As the economy reopens with vaccination and fiscal support and monetary policy support, the supply side—just all over the world, you’re seeing the same thing, which is, it just can’t keep up."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"And there are labor shortages in, in a lot of places, the same sort of thing."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, you know, there’s, there’s absolutely no sense of panic."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,This is a different thing.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"I just—I’ve explained, I think, several times here today that the best—my, my best estimate is that this is something that will pass."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, if you—if you look at where forecasters are—people who actually write down a forecast for a living—very, very strongly they see it that way."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"Now, we—but, you know, are—we’re actually responsible for this, though, so we have to take seriously the risk, the risk case, which is that inflation will be more persistent, that it might actually move inflation expectations up, and that we might—that the kind of things that might require a response."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"We, again, we don’t see that now."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"But we, we have to be on the alert for it."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"And people have to understand and believe that we will react if, if we need to."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,And we will.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, again, it’s not—it’s not my base case."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s really a shock to the economy that will pass through.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"My base case is that—is, as I’ve said repeatedly, is that inflation will move back down."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"So the bigger picture is that, you know, that, that, that would be a healthy thing."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"We, we want inflation expectations to be centered on, on 2 percent."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,Okay.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,Let’s go to Greg Robb at MarketWatch.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,GREG ROBB.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,Hi.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,We feel like they may be a little bit below that.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks for taking my question.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,I’m just kind of surprised by your tone.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"It, it seems like you’re just sort of warning that, if inflation gets too high, you know, the Fed will act."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"Isn’t it true that, I mean, a little inflation is good for the economy and, and that we—if somehow maybe we can get the economy out of this sort of place where we’re always going to be close to the zero lower bound, isn’t there a good story to tell, and you’re sort of panicking people?"
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"I certainly don’t, don’t have that in mind."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,No.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"Look, we—as you know, we’re targeting a moderate overshoot of 2 percent inflation for some time."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"Chair Powell, I was going to go back to inflation a little bit."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHAEL DERBY.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"And no, we’re not—we, we have not at all changed our view, and I haven’t changed my view that inflation running above 2 percent, moderately above 2 percent, is a desirable thing."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,This is well above 2 percent.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"Now, when it happens gradually, when that—if you—we’ve seen in a long expansion, sometimes unit labor costs do move up and, and put some pressure on margins."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"In a long expansion, that’s been happening late in the expansion."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"That’s not a problem, either."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,The problem is if it happens in a way that pushes firms broadly into raising prices.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,It was called the “wage–price spiral.” We don’t see that now.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"This is something that was a feature of the high inflationary era of the Great Inflation, but it’s not a feature now."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,And we don’t see that now.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"And that really is if what we call “unit labor costs” move up and, and, and, which really puts—move up in a way that is—that is hard for companies to manage and puts them in a situation where they have to accept substantially lower margins or raise prices."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"Of course, we’ll be watching it."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"Given the very large number of job openings and the very large number of unemployed people, we’d like to see, you know, those— some matching going on there so people get back to work."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,We think labor supply would be— would be a healthy thing.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, but wages moving up across the spectrum, consistent with inflation and productivity, is a—is a good thing."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you, Chair Powell."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,And thank you all.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,Some people will retire.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,And this is one of the reasons why we’re watching so carefully to see whether labor force—whether people do come back and accept jobs.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,This is not moderately above 2 percent.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we, we don’t see—there, there is a form of wage inflation that can lead to price inflation, and we’re not seeing that right now."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,And it’s—a lot of it is driven at relatively low-paid jobs in the service industries as people come back.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,But it’s also not the kind of inflation we were looking for.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,This is really driven by a supply-side shock.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,GREG ROBB.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,We’ll go to Don Lee at the Los Angeles Times for the last question.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,So that’s not troubling.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,DON LEE.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,I wonder if you could talk about wages.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"Many workers seem to have gotten some good wage gains in, in recent months."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,What can workers generally expect going forward?
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,And it doesn’t sound like you’re concerned about rising wages feeding into broader inflation.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,Is that right?
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,So wages have moved up.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Chair Powell."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you for taking my question.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"At some point, the rates will not be so attractive as, as the whole rate cluster normalizes, and, and you’ll see it shrink back down."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,Not at this point.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"And so, if we start to see those things happen fairly widely among the—among the things that have really moved up quickly, then we’ll, we’ll—they won’t all happen at once or happen quickly—but we’ll know that our basic understanding of the situation is broadly correct."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I don’t think it will take, or what I said was, I don’t think it’ll take a very long time to see whether that’s the case."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"It, it, it is probably the case that, frankly, the, the overall reopening of the economy is going to play out over a period of time."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"This is a historic, world historical event, that the global economy is now reopening."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s not going to—it’s not going to happen quickly.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s going to take some time.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"And it’s going to be very uneven, as we discussed before."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"If they flatten out, then their, their contribution to inflation becomes zero over time so that they’re not contributing to inflation."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"But I think we will—we will know, you know, when we know."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,I don’t want to put a number on it.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"But I do think that, that, if we see those things happening, we’ll know that we have the story basically right."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,We’ll go to Brian Cheung at Yahoo Finance.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,BRIAN CHEUNG.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Chairman Powell."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,But I don’t think it will take that long.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"Brian Cheung, Yahoo Finance."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,Do they actually move down?
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,So what we want to see is these other things.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,You also mentioned learning a lot more in the next six months about the economy.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,Can you tell us a little more of what you mean by that?
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,When do you think you’ll get a clean reading on inflation that is free of most of the distortions that we’re seeing now?
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,Right.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"So with inflation, as I mentioned, we’re, we look not just at the headline number, but we look at all the components that go into the calculation of inflation."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"And if you do that, if you look under the hood, what you see is not that, widely, across the whole range of goods and services that, that are in the economy, we’re seeing upward, upward pressure on prices."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,Do they—do they—do the prices flatten out?
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s not really what we’re seeing.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, as I mentioned, it’s things like cars."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, new, used, and rental cars have moved up in price because of the car shortage because of the semiconductor shortage."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"And housing—sorry, hotels and air, air fares have moved back up, but that really just is retracing the very large downward movement in prices that they had before."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"So that’s, that’s a big, big part of, of why the inflation readings are so high."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"And those don’t—those, frankly, don’t carry significant implications in the long run for the—for inflation or for the American economy."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"So what I said was, we, we’re going to see whether these things—we don’t need to see everything do what lumber prices have done."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"So if you look at lumber prices, they went up and then they went down."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"What we’re seeing is a handful of things that are really—that really account for the, the overshoot of inflation."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mean, money markets, private money market funds are, are choosing to, to invest because the rates are attractive."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,I’m just wondering if you could provide a little bit more color in terms of how you’re thinking about mortgage-backed securities purchases as you inch towards taper.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"Is that more because of the optics, or is it because there’s an observed relationship from the Committee’s view between MBS purchases under QE and the hot housing market?"
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"So it, it really is a backstop."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"So it’s, it’s set at 25 basis points, so out of the money, and it’s, it’s there to help address pressures in money market—money markets that could impede the effective implementation of monetary policy."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, really, it’s, it’s to support the function of—functioning of monetary policy and its, its effectiveness."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s the purpose of it.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,And it’s set up with that purpose in mind.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"Your question on, on the, the [ON]RRP, so we think it’s doing what it’s supposed to do, what we expect of it to do, which is to help provide a floor for money market rates and help ensure that the federal funds, funds rate stays within the target range."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, it’s essentially, essentially, what’s happening is that it just results in a lower aggregate amount of Federal Reserve liabilities that are in banks in the form of reserves and a higher amount of Federal Reserve liabilities in money market funds in the form of overnight RRP balances."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"So on the standing repo facility, what is it going to do?"
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"So that, that’s all that’s really happening there."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s being driven, of course, by, by the relatively lower quantity of Treasury bills and, and, and also the onset of the debt ceiling and the decline in the TGA, things like that."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we don’t— we don’t have a problem with, with what it’s doing."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s kind of doing the job we expected.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHAEL DERBY.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"And you don’t see any issues with, like, disaggregating, you know, markets from, you know, investing in private money market securities?"
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, like, the idea that the Fed’s footprint in money markets is getting too big, you don’t see any issues there?"
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,And we expect it to be high for some time.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"Within the context of home prices continuing to rise, we’ve heard a lot of people talk about the idea that maybe they’d like to cool off on, specifically, the MBS purchases."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"And also, kind of in a similarly related point, the reverse repo numbers have just gotten even bigger since you raised the reverse repo rate at the last Fed meeting."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"So a number of participants raised that—the questions around MBS and tapering at, at today’s meeting, as a matter of fact, and yesterday’s meeting."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I’ll just say that, generally speaking, I don’t think and—I don’t think that—I think that Treasury and MBS purchases affect financial conditions in very similar ways."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"There may be modest differences in terms of, of contribution to housing prices, but it’s, it’s not something that’s big."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s not—it’s—so where I think we are is, there, there really is little support for the idea of tapering MBS earlier than Treasuries."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,I think we will taper them at the same time.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, are you concerned to see, you know, nearly $1 trillion a day, you know, pouring in through that facility?"
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"It seems likely, based on where people are now."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,And I think it’s something that we’ll be continuing to discuss.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,Let’s go to Michael Derby.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHAEL DERBY.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you very much.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,So I wanted to ask you about the standing repo facility and get your sense of what you think it will do for market trading conditions.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"The idea of reducing MBS purchases at a somewhat faster pace than Treasuries does have some attraction for some people—others, not so much."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"If you look at where labor force participation can get, people will go back to work unless they retire."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,A lot of that is driven by new hires.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"And that may be because people, people are shopping carefully for their next job."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,I’m sorry.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"Yes, yes."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,We can hear you.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,ANN SAPHIR.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,I apologize.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"I—just to follow up on the question, I want to ask, you know, is it—is it correct to see this as the, the start of the advance notice process, you know, before a taper?"
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,Can you hear me?
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, and, and also, can you speak to how the recent surge in COVID factors into your thinking on, on the taper?"
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, as you know, we’re, we’re in a process now where what we said is that as—at this meeting and in coming meetings, we’re going to be continuing to assess the economy’s progress toward our goals and give advance notice."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’ll be—try to provide additional clarity about our thinking, both in the—in the postmeeting statement and in the minutes and in the public comments that people make."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, our, our approach here has been to be as transparent as we can."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,We have not reached substantial further progress yet.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we’re, we’re not there, and we see our ways as having some—we see ourselves as having some ground to cover to get there."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,So that’s what I would say.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"In terms of—in terms of, of COVID and the Delta strain, I’ll say a couple things."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,[No response] Hello.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,Hello.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,I would want to see some strong job numbers.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, and that’s, that’s kind of the idea."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,STEVE LIESMAN.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"If, if I could follow up, you talked about one side of the equation."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,You didn’t—does it mean you feel like you’ve reached your goal when it comes to the inflation side?
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,Can you hear me?
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"So inflation is running well above our 2 percent objective and has been for a few months and is expected to run up certainly above our objective for a few months before we believe it’ll, it’ll move back down toward our objective."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,I can’t—I can’t do that by myself.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"But it’s clear that, at this time, inflation is actually running above 2 percent."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, and, again, has been and will be, at least we expect it will, in coming months before returning down toward our target."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,Ann Saphir with Reuters.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,ANN SAPHIR.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,The question whether we’ve met that objective formally is really one for the Committee to make.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think we’re, we’re some way away from, from having had substantial further progress with, with max—toward the maximum-employment goal."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"Of course, it will have significant health consequences for many."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"This is a—rising cases in, in a number of parts of the country, and some forecasts are for them to rise quite significantly."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,It really isn’t relevant now.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"It—because we’re really—we’re looking at, at tapering asset purchases."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,We’re clearly a ways away from considering raising interest rates.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s not something that, that is on our radar screen right now."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, so when we get to that question, when we start to get to the question of, of liftoff, which, which we are not at all at now or near now, that’s when we’ll ask that question."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"That is when that, that will become a real question for us."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"That’s—what the guidance is for liftoff, we had to have labor market conditions consistent with full employment, inflation at 2 percent and on track to run—to run moderately above 2 percent for some time."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,JEANNA SMIALEK.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Chair Powell."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you for taking our questions.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,I wonder if you could talk a little bit about [inaudible] reacting [inaudible].
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, does that affect, affect how you’re thinking about tapering?"
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"Does it affect how you’re thinking about, you know, potential liftoff down the road?"
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"And if you could, just talk a little bit about that."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,Jeanna Smialek at the New York Times.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,And we need to keep that in mind before we start—before we mention and move to the economic questions.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"But I would really say, the guidance that you’re talking about is really the guidance to do with liftoff, right?"
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,We’ll see.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"What we’ve seen, though, is with successive waves of, of COVID over the past year and some months now, there has tended to be less economic—less in the way of economic implications from each wave."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,And we will see whether that is the case with the Delta variety.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"But it’s, you know, it’s a—it’s certainly a—not an unreasonable expectation."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"So it, it certainly is plausible if people would pull back from some activities because of the risk of infection."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"Dining out, traveling, schools might—some schools might not reopen."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"We may just—we may see economic effects from some of that, or it might weigh on, on the return to the labor market."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"That, that would, again, be a question for the Committee."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"Some people might choose—again, we, we don’t have a strong sense of how that might work out, so we’ll just be monitoring it—monitoring it carefully."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,We’ll go to Nick Timiraos at the Wall Street Journal.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,NICK TIMIRAOS.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Chair Powell."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,Nick Timiraos at the Wall Street Journal.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"In your opening statements in March and April, you noted that a transitory rise in inflation above 2 percent this year would not meet the threshold of moderately exceeding 2 percent for some time, and I noticed you didn’t repeat that qualification last month or today."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, and so, in your view, has the rise in inflation this year met the threshold of moderately exceeding 2 percent for some time?"
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"I’d say we have some ground to cover on, on the labor market side."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,And that’s what we’re going to try to do.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"In particular, despite progress, joblessness continues to fall disproportionately on lower-wage workers in the service sector and on African Americans and Hispanics."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,Inflation has increased notably and will likely remain elevated in coming months before moderating.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"As the economy continues to reopen and spending rebounds, we are seeing upward pressure on prices, particularly because supply bottlenecks in some sectors have limited how quickly production can respond in the near term."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"These bottleneck effects have been larger than anticipated, but as these transitory supply effects abate, inflation is expected to drop back toward our longer-run goal."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"Very low readings from early in the pandemic as well as the pass-through of past increases in oil prices to consumer energy prices also contribute to the increase, although these base effects and energy effects are receding."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"The process of reopening the economy is unprecedented, as was the shutdown at the onset of the pandemic."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"As the reopening continues, bottlenecks, hiring difficulties, and other constraints could continue to limit how quickly supply can adjust, raising the possibility that inflation could turn out to be higher and more persistent than we expect."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"The economic downturn has not fallen equally on all Americans, and those least able to shoulder the burden have been hardest hit."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"Our new framework for monetary policy emphasizes the importance of having well-anchored inflation expectations, both to, to foster price stability and to enhance our ability to promote our broad-based and inclusive maximum-employment goal."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"If we saw signs that the path of inflation or longer-term inflation expectations were moving materially and persistently beyond levels consistent with our goal, we’d be prepared to adjust the stance of policy."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"The effects of the pandemic on the economy have continued to diminish, but risks to the economic outlook remain."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,Progress on vaccinations has limited the spread of COVID-19.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"However, the pace of vaccinations has slowed, and the Delta strain of the virus is spreading quickly in some areas."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,Continued progress on vaccinations would support a return to more normal economic conditions.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"The Fed’s policy actions have been guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people, along with our responsibilities to promote the stability of the financial system."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"As the Committee reiterated in today’s policy statement, with inflation having run persistently below 2 percent, we will aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time so that inflation averages 2 percent over time and longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2 percent."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,Indicators of long-term inflation expectations appear broadly consistent with our longer- run inflation goal of 2 percent.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,We expect to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until these employment and inflation outcomes are achieved.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"These factors should wane in coming months, leading to strong gains in employment."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"The unemployment rate in June—in June was 5.9 percent, and this figure understates the shortfall in employment, particularly as participation in the labor market has not moved up from the low rates that have prevailed for most of the past year."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mean, I, I, I think the bottom line on this is, people want to work."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"Transcript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference July 28, 2021 CHAIR POWELL."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,Good afternoon.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"At the Federal Reserve, we are strongly committed to achieving the monetary policy goals that Congress has given us: maximum employment and price stability."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,Today the Federal Open Market Committee kept interest rates near zero and maintained our asset purchases.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"These measures, along with our strong guidance on interest rates and on our balance sheet, will ensure that monetary policy will continue to support the economy until the recovery is complete."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"Indicators of economic activity and employment have continued to strengthen, and real GDP this year appears to be on track to post its fastest rate of increase in decades."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"Factors related to the pandemic, such as caregiving needs, ongoing fears of the virus, and unemployment insurance payments, appear to be weighing on employment growth."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,Much of this rapid growth reflects the continued bounceback in activity from depressed levels.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"Household spending is rising at an especially rapid pace, boosted by the ongoing reopening of the economy and ongoing policy support."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"The housing sector remains very strong, and business investment is increasing at a solid pace."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"In some industries, near-term supply constraints are restraining activity."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"These constraints are particularly acute in the motor vehicle industry, where worldwide shortages of semiconductors have sharply curtailed production so far this year."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"As with overall economic activity, conditions in the labor market have continued to improve."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"Demand for labor is very strong, and employment rose 850,000 in June, with the leisure and hospitality sector continuing to post notable gains."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"Nonetheless, the labor market has a ways to go."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,The sectors most adversely affected by the pandemic have shown improvement but have not fully recovered.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,So what would substantial further progress be?
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"With regard to interest rates, we continue to expect that it will be appropriate to maintain the current 0 to ¼ percent target range for the federal funds rate until labor market conditions have reached level—levels consistent with the Committee’s assessment of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,Our asset purchases have been a critical tool.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,Great.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,So more detail on substantial further progress.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,So let’s talk about the maximum-employment part of that.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"As you know, with maximum employment—unlike with, with price stability, where we can target a number of 2 percent on average—with maximum employment, there isn’t a single number that we can target."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"That the— we monitor a broad range of, of, of data about different aspects of the labor market."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"There’s unemployment, unemployment among different, different age groups, and such."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,There’s wages.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,There’s all kinds of flow data.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,And we look at all of it to try to arrive at a picture of what—of what is maximum employment.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"So there isn’t—I can’t give you a, a, a set of numbers—for example, a numerical threshold like we used for a time back in 2012, I guess it was."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,We didn’t do that here.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,What we said was substantial further progress toward our goals.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"And what we said was, we would keep, effectively, we’d—we would give advance warning as we—and, and, you know, more and more clarity—as, as we move forward."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,There’s participation.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"In addition, we are continuing to—continuing to increase our holdings of Treasury securities by at least $80 billion per month and of agency MBS by at least $40 billion per month until substantial further progress has been made toward our maximum-employment and price- stability goals."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,And if you could be more specific about what substantial further progress would look like and if that would then lead you to an announcement of an actual reduction in the purchases of your assets.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you very much.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,They helped preserve financial stability and market functioning early in the pandemic and since then have helped foster accommodative financial conditions to support the economy.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"At our meeting that concluded earlier today, the Committee continued to discuss the progress made toward our—toward our goals since the Committee adopted its asset purchase guidance last December."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"We also reviewed some considerations around how our asset purchases might be adjusted, including their pace and composition, once economic conditions warrant a change."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"Participants expect that the economy will continue to move toward our standard of “substantial further progress.” In coming meetings, the Committee will again assess the economy’s progress toward our goals, and the timing of any change in the pace of our asset purchases will depend on the incoming data."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"As we’ve said, we will provide advance notice before making any changes to our purchases."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"On a final note, we announced the establishment of two standing repo facilities, a domestic one for primary dealers and additional banks and another for foreign and international monetary authorities."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,These facilities will serve as backstops in money markets to support the effective implementation of monetary policy and smooth market functioning.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"Mr. Chairman, I wonder if you might be able to put some, I don’t know, numbers or maybe more detail around this concept of “substantial further progress.” What counts as the progress numerically, if you will, or, or, or citing data, if you could, that you cited in the statement today?"
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"To conclude, we understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,We at the Fed will do everything we can to support the economy for as long as it takes to complete the recovery.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,I look forward to your questions.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,Let’s go to Steve Liesman with CNBC.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,STEVE LIESMAN.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,Everything we do is in service to our public mission.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"Jeanna, I’m sorry."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,Progress in vaccinations and unprecedented fiscal policy actions are also providing strong support to the recovery.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,Could you—could you say that again?
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, and, two, does it also mean you’d be prepared to raise interest rates even if you are still buying assets?"
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"So there’s a—there’s a part in our Statement on Longer-Run Goals and, and Monetary Policy Strategy, which, Rich, I’m sure—I’m sure you’re familiar with, which, which talks about that case in which the two goals are in tension."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"Most of the time, if you have high inflation, you also have high employment—they, they tend to go together."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,This is a situation where they’re temporarily in different directions.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’re not at full employment, but we are having high inflation."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"Does that mean you’d be prepared to raise interest rates even if we’re not at maximum employment at that point, should you see this danger of inflation?"
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"We feel like we’re going to be making good progress over the next—over the course of the next year, couple of years, really, toward maximum employment."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"If you look at the number of job openings compared to the number of unemployed, it’s—we’re, we’re clearly on a path to a very strong labor market with high participation, low unemployment, high employment, wages moving up across the spectrum."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"That, that’s, that’s the path that we’re on, and, and it shouldn’t take that long in macroeconomic time to get there."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"So that’s, that’s what I think is, is really the likely case."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, again, it’s not—it’s not timely for us to be thinking about, about raising interest rates right now."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"What we’re doing is, we’re, we’re looking at our asset purchases and judging what is right for the economy and judging how we—how close we are to substantial further progress and then—and then tapering after that."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"The question you asked about, would we raise rates if we hadn’t finished cutting—hadn’t finished the taper, hypothetical question."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, we’d, we’d face the circumstance at the time."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,This is a very strong labor market.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"We could always just—you know, one thing one could do would be to just cut asset purchases all the way to zero if you wanted to do that."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,I want to just try to understand that in the context of the framework and the forward guidance.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thanks very much, Michelle."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I, I, I don’t see in any of that that there is really anything that challenges the credibility of our framework, if, if that’s really your question."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,We are committed to achieving 2 percent average inflation over time.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"What we said was that, in particular, when we see a very strong labor market, high levels of employment, low levels of unemployment, that won’t be enough for us to raise interest rates until we see some inflation."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"Of course, what we have today is kind of the opposite."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’ve got, you know, 7 or 8 million people, fewer people, at work than were at work before the pandemic."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we’re, you know, we’re, we’re a ways away from full maximum employment."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"But we have high inflation, so it’s kind of the opposite case."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"Chairman Powell, you, you just alluded to the fact that you’re prepared to use your tools to slow the economy down if need be to—if inflation looks like it’s getting out of control."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,And we have to—we have to deal with that.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we’re monitoring that very carefully, and we’re prepared to use our tools as appropriate."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, again, I think our—I think our framework is pretty well understood."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, and I think the real test of it will be down the road when it’s time to think about raising interest rates and, and how we assess, assess that set of issues."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,We’ll go to Rich at Bloomberg.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,RICH MILLER.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"Any central bank has to deal with that by looking at the inflation and asking whether it is broad based and likely to be persistent and, and, and whether inflation expectations are implicated in a way that, that could cause them to rise."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"And there, there are also so-called technical factors, which is where you put things that you can’t quite explain."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"But it’s, it’s, it’s just hard to—it’s hard to answer what you would do without knowing a lot more about the situation."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,So that wouldn’t be ideal.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"So that’s a time-intensive, labor-intensive process."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,And there may be a bit of a speed limit on that.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"There, there’s research that suggests that there is a speed limit on that."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,So it’s not like you can have millions of people at the beginning of the recovery going back in a single month because they’re just going back to their old job.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"This is about job selection, things like that."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"There may also be some factors that are—that are holding people back, and that’s—this is what surveys say."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"There are people who, who are reluctant to go back to work because they still feel exposed to COVID."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s about finding a new job.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"These could be jobs where, where there was a lot of, of interaction with the public and where perhaps there’s a family member who’s vulnerable or for whatever reason."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"And there’s also been very generous unemployment benefits, which are now rolling off."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,They’ll be—they’ll be fully rolled off in a couple of months.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"And all of those factors should, should wane."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mean, ultimately, it’s unusual to see aspects like the job openings number in a context where there are that many unemployed people."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,That many job openings would typically suggest a tight labor market.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, of course, we hear from businesses all over the country that it’s very hard to hire people."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"For the first 15 seconds of your question, you froze."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"There’s also caretakers who are—where, where schools are not fully open and parents are at home or taking care of, of, of older people."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"Ideally, you wouldn’t be still buying assets and raising rates because, of course, you’re adding accommodation by buying and, and removing accommodation by raising rates."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"Maybe the place to start is, is just to say that this is now not so much about people going back to their old jobs."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s a—it’s a really unusual situation to have—to have the ratio of vacancies to unemployed be this high.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,I’ll say that.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,We’ll go to Edward Lawrence at Fox Business.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,EDWARD LAWRENCE.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"So thank you, Mr. Chairman."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for taking the question."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,And we think there are a number of things at work there.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"Now, so you’re talking about jobs."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, we have 9.5 million people unemployed as of the last labor market survey and 9.2 million job openings."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,So what’s the—what’s the disconnect?
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,Is it a skills gap?
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,Is it the extended unemployment benefits?
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,Is it the fact that people just aren’t willing to relocate?
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,What is the disconnect there?
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,You just said we’re on a path to a very strong job market.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"There was also some decline in inflation compensation, which has significantly reversed."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, we, we think we should see, because of that, we should see strong job creation moving forward."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,We’ve seen the long-term yields go down significantly.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s one way.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"Another way, though, is more on the risk side."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"And that is, as long as COVID is running loose out there, as long as there’s time and space for the development of new strains, no one’s really finally safe."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"These, these strains—there’s no reason they just can’t keep coming and one, you know, one more powerful than the next."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,We don’t know that.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"But that’s, that’s, that’s certainly a plausible outcome."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"Now, as, as vaccinations rise, we can nonetheless get back to our economic activity."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, you know, it, it is both the right thing to do and, and very much in our interest to make sure that vaccination happens broadly around the world, just for that reason."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,James at the FT. JAMES POLITI.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you very much.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"Chair Powell, how would you describe the risks to the outlook on inflation at the moment after the last data came out higher than expected?"
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"Do you believe the risks are, you know, tilted to the upside?"
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,And does the Committee share that view?
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"To the extent the global economy is weak and the United States is strong, it’ll—we’ll wind up, you know, we’ll wind up exporting some of our demand through, through imports rather than having, having a lot of exports."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, and, you know, that’ll help economic activity."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,And so a stronger global economy will lead to more U.S. exports.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"One just is that, in general, economies—and through financial markets and through trade—are, are deeply interconnected now."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"Some of it is a fall in real yields, which may have been connected to—some speculate—connected to sentiment around the, the spread of the Delta variant and concern about growth."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,JEANNA SMIALEK.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"Oh, yes."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,Sorry.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,Yes.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,So I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about how the divergence in global growth and the sort of multispeed recovery we’re seeing around the world impacts how the Fed thinks about its policies.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"So do you take into account that sort of multispeed recovery when you’re thinking about tapering QE, and do you take, take it into account when you’re thinking about liftoff?"
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,Or are they in balance?
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,So it’s an—it’s an important feature of this recovery is how uneven it is.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, in many cases, that’s related to the fact that some countries have had little in the way of access to, to vaccines."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"And so they’re seeing significant outbreaks, and it’s weighing on economic activity, whereas other countries—such as the United States, in particular—are having a very strong rebound."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, and now Europe is having a stronger rebound as well."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,So it’s a feature of our economy.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"Now, how does it affect our policy?"
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"In, in a couple of ways, potentially."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"Are you still worried that there could be a hit to demand from, from the Delta variant that could tilt them sort of to the downside again?"
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,No.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"And if we were to see inflation moving up to levels persistently that were—that were above, significantly, materially above our goal and particularly if inflation expectations were to move up, we would use our tools to guide inflation back down to 2 percent."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we won’t have an extended period of, of high inflation."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"We think that, that some of it will, will fall away naturally as the process of reopening the economy moves through."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,And it could take some time.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"In any case, we will use our tools over time as appropriate to make sure that we do have inflation that averages 2 percent over time."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,Price stability is half of our mandate.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,Victoria at Politico.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Mr. Chairman."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,So bond market pricing seems to suggest that investors think the Fed might eventually overtighten.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"So my question is, do you think that markets have bought into the central bank’s new framework?"
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,And how do you balance that with managing inflation concerns?
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"If you could give us a sense of that, that would be very helpful."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"Well, so in terms of what’s been happening in bond markets, I don’t think there’s a real consensus on, on what explains the moves between the last meeting and this meeting."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,VICTORIA GUIDA.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"I, I, I will say, though, that, you know, we—inflation is half of our mandate."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,I apologize.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"I, I, I have some confidence in the—in the medium term, that inflation will move back down."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"Again, it’s hard to say when that will be."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,I’d be glad to.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"So if you look, again, if you look at the, the most recent inflation report, what you see is that it came in significantly higher than expected."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,But essentially all of the overshoot can be tied to a handful of categories.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,It isn’t the kind of inflation that’s spread broadly across the economy.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s new, used, and rental cars."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s airplane tickets.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s hotels.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,Sure.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,And each of those has a story attached to it that is—that is really about the reopening of the economy.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,And it’s a couple of other things.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"Now, we don’t have any—much confidence, let’s say, in the timing of that or the size of the effects in the near term."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,And so we think that inflation should move down over time.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,And it’s a real—a real asset that we have.
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"I would say, in the near term, that the, the, the risks to inflation are probably to the upside."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"We have a very adaptive, adaptable, flexible economy and labor market."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we look at that, and we think that those are temporary things because the, the supply side will respond."
2021-07-28,Press Conf - Full Text,The economy will adapt.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"It would have been raised instantly, rather than once every five years."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"You’re right, though, these—as I mentioned, we have had a framework for a long time, and it’s similar to what other government agencies have, only it’s a little stricter."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"And it is that you can trade financial instruments, but not specific ones like bank debt."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,You can’t trade during the FOMC period and during the meeting—the blackout period and then during the meeting.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"And then you disclose all this, and we have disclosed it for years."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"So all of these things have been going—to the extent they’ve been going on, they’ve been a matter of public record."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"And now you look at it, and you see this, and you think, “We need to do better.” And we will."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHAEL DERBY.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"But you’re right, but it has not been part of the process."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, appropriately, I don’t think it should have been."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mean, I wouldn’t blame the people who conduct that review."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"I really think, if someone had raised concerns or if we’d had concerns, then it would have been, but it wouldn’t have been part of that process."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know—but, nonetheless—so that—you know, it was seeming to work just okay."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,We wouldn’t wait that day if there were concerns.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, you know, the five-year review that we do under this unusual provision of law where all of the Reserve Bank presidents are reviewed for reappointment at the same time every five years, that is really a broad review about their leadership of the institution, their performance on the FOMC, all of those things."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"So these, I don’t need to tell you, we file, people file these reports annually."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,And I think they were just quite recently filed for 2020.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,So I don’t have any reason to think people at the Board would have known about particular trading that’s going on.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"They will see that—there are people at the Fed who see the, you know, see the trading reports when they’re, you know, when they’re annually filed."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, in terms of having confidence and that sort of thing, I think no one is happy, no one on the FOMC is happy to be in this situation, to be having these questions raised."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s something we take very, very seriously."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"And if there were a concern—a public concern or a private concern—about something that someone had done, we wouldn’t wait for the five-year."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"This is an important moment for the Fed, and I’m determined that we will rise to the moment and handle it in ways that will stand up over time."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, when we have things to announce, we’ll go ahead and do that, but that’s really what I have for today."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,One small follow-up.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mean, I know that you didn’t have the 2020 forms in hand, but you would have had past-year forms in hand."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"And at least in the case of, like, the Dallas disclosure forms, similar trading activity was shown in years past."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"So that, in theory, could have been something that came up in the renomination process."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"So that’s, yeah, that’s a good question."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"I’m very reluctant to get ahead of the process and speculate, though, about different things."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHAEL DERBY.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,Let’s go to Jean Yung.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,We’ll go to Edward Lawrence.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,EDWARD LAWRENCE.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you, Michelle."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for taking the question."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"So on corporate debt, what happened with Evergrande that we’ve been watching, could that be—is that a preview of what could happen with the amount of corporate debt that’s out there?"
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,In the past you’ve said you’re watching the level of corporate debt.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"So is, what’s your level of concern right now?"
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,And would you consider the Evergrande Group issue sort of a warning signal?
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"About the United States, no."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,Corporate defaults are very low in the United States right now.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, going forward, do you still have confidence in the Dallas and Boston Fed Bank presidents to do their job?"
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,Corporate leverage built up over the course of the long expansion that ended with the pandemic.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,We were very concerned in the last year or so.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,Great.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"But we think, we do expect that this is sort of—because of the COVID shock and the reopening and all that, you’re seeing this temporarily."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"We don’t really think we’re in that—we’re sort of in that situation, I’d say, in a short-term way."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,JEAN YUNG.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you, Michelle."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"Chair Powell, I wanted to ask about how the Fed would balance the two parts of its dual mandate if inflation stays elevated but we still have a labor shortage and participation remains lower than ideal."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,Would you hold off on raising rates?
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,Or how would you think about that?
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"Well, let me say one thing."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"You’re looking for conditions consistent with maximum employment to lift off, and those conditions can change over time."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"But more to your point, really, we actually have a paragraph in our framework, and something like this has been there for a long time."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s, I think it’s paragraph six."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,And you’re talking about a situation in which the two goals are not complementary; they’re somehow in tension.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"And if we judge that’s effect—that is the case, what it says is, we take into account the employment shortfalls and inflation deviations and the potentially different time horizons over which employment and inflation are projected to return to levels judged consistent with the mandate."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, we used to call that the balanced-approach paragraph because it had those words."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,So it’s a very difficult situation for any central bank to be—pardon me—to be in a situation where the two goals are in tension.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"How long will it take, and how big are the gaps, and that kind of thing."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"So you’re not necessarily bound by a particular level of the unemployment rate or the participation rate or anything else like that, which can change over time."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,And that paragraph tries to address it by saying we would sort of weigh the equities between the two.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,So it’s just very important that the debt ceiling be raised in a timely fashion so that the United States can pay its bills when and as they come due.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,And Governor Brainard described it as a rigorous process at the time.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"Well, you really—I mean, first of all, ideally, there wouldn’t be any gap, of course."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,We would all love to see no such gap.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"This is a persistent gap, and it’s very hard to explain based on typical metrics."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s just, it’s quite troubling, but it really is—you know, we have, you know, famously broad and blunt tools."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think eliminating inequality and racial discrimination and racial disparities and that kind of thing is really something that fiscal policy and other policies—frankly, education policies and that kind of thing—are better at focusing on."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think we’ve identified the part that we can do, and we’ll do that part."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,But I’ve always been clear that it’s going to take policies broadly across society to work on these problems.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,STEVE MATTHEWS.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,Let’s go to Michael McKee.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHAEL MCKEE.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"—a plan for dealing with a debt default that included prioritization, that included changes in bank regulations and possibly selling defaulted—or, nondefaulted Treasuries and buying those who are—that are."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,Are any or all of those still on the table?
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,Do you think any of those would work?
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"Or should that be— should the gap be narrowed, if not down to zero?"
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,STEVE MATTHEWS.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,And you saw wages at the low end moving up faster than everywhere else—something that’s great to see.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"We were concerned in the last year or so, and then I’d say very concerned at the beginning of the pandemic that, if you’ve got a highly leveraged company and your revenue stops for an uncertain period, as things happened at the beginning of the crisis, we were very concerned that there would be a wave of defaults."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"We also saw the lowest unemployment rates for minorities of various, you know, for African Americans, for example, and also participation rates."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"We saw a really, really healthy set of dynamics."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, by the way, we also—there was no reason why it couldn’t continue."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"There were no imbalances in the economy, and then along came the pandemic."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,We were not—there was nothing in the economy that looked like a buildup of imbalances that could cause a recession.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,So I was very much thinking that the country would really benefit from a few more years of this.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,It would have been—so we’re all quite eager to get back to that.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"We also said we wouldn’t raise rates just in response to very low unemployment, in the absence of inflation."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"So that was another aspect of it, because we saw that that really benefited labor market participants in a broad and inclusive way."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"That’s, of course, not the current situation."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"We have significant slack in the economy and inflation well above target, not moderately above target."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"So that’s, really, how we think about it."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"It isn’t really just targeting the headline numbers, but it’s about taking all of those things into account in your thinking about what constitutes maximum employment."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"Just to follow up, should there be a significant gap between Black unemployment and overall unemployment for structural reasons that are outside of the control of the Fed that other people should be doing something about?"
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"And what would happen to the economy, in your view, should the debt ceiling not be raised?"
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, I missed the first few words, but I think I got your question."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we’re, of course, very closely monitoring Wells Fargo’s efforts to fix its widespread and pervasive problems."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"They represent a serious matter to us, and the firm is required to remediate them."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,And we will take appropriate supervisory action if the firm fails to meet our expectation.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,We continue to hold the firm accountable for its deficiencies with an unprecedented asset cap that will stay in place until the firm has comprehensively fixed its problems.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,And we’re not going to remove that asset cap until that’s done.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"So bottom line is, we’ll take strong supervisory action if a firm is engaging in unsafe and unsound practices or violating laws."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,But I can’t speak to our confidential supervisory assessments of any individual bank.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,Now we’ll go to Michael Derby.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHAEL DERBY.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you for taking my question.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,You noted earlier in the press conference that you weren’t aware of the trading activity of the Boston and Dallas Fed Bank presidents.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"As you know, those, all 12 regional Fed Bank presidents just went through the renomination process earlier this year."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"And if the indiscretions at Wells Fargo, in your opinion, warrant such an action?"
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"I’m just curious, under what circumstances would the Fed actually consider revoking a financial holding company’s license?"
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"Senator Warren sent you a letter last week urging the Fed to break up Wells Fargo, citing what she called “ungovernable behavior” from the bank."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,Hi—thanks so much.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s a critically important thing.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"The failure to do that is something that could result in severe reactions, severe damage to the economy and to the financial markets."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"And it’s just not something that we could contemplate, that we should contemplate."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,I’m not going to comment on particular tactics or things like that.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,I’m just going to say that I think we can all agree that the United States shouldn’t default on any of its obligations—should pay them when and as due.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"And that, you know, no one should assume that the Fed or anyone else can protect the markets or the economy in the event of a failure—fully protect in the event of a failure to, you know, to make sure that we do pay those debts when they’re due."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHAEL MCKEE.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I want to know, did anybody know—did anybody at the Board level know about the stock trading activity?"
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,Good.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, I don’t generally ever talk about the conversations I have with elected officials or other appointed officials."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, look, you can see that this is a major focus among those who have responsibility for it, and—including elected people."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,Let’s go to Hannah Lang.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,HANNAH LANG.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"If I could follow up, have you discussed options with members of Congress?"
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"It didn’t happen, potentially—I mean, to a significant extent because of the CARES Act and the response that we undertook and all that."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I think for whatever reason now, you have very, very low default rates now among corporate debt."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, but we certainly have the freedom to either speed it up or slow it down if that becomes appropriate."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,HEATHER SCOTT.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,But you wouldn’t expect rate liftoff to happen until you’re finished with that process?
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"You wouldn’t, no, because, you know, when you’re—as long as you’re buying assets, you’re adding accommodation, and it wouldn’t make any sense to, you know, then lift off."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mean, what you would do is, you’d speed up the taper, I think, if that were the situation you’re in."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"Not—we don’t expect to be in that situation, but I do think it would be wiser at that point to go ahead and speed up the taper, just because the two are then working in the same direction."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,HEATHER SCOTT.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"All right, thank you."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"Okay, for the last question, we’ll go to Jeff Cox."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,JEFF COX.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for taking the question."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,It will be when we agree on it.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,I just wanted to check in with you to see if you have an update at all on the efforts from the Fed to develop a central bank digital currency.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s a very gradual taper.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,The economy’s much farther along than it was when we tapered in 2013.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,Hi.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"Sorry, you caught me off guard."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you, Chair Powell, for taking my question."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,I really appreciate it.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"Again, on the taper timing."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,You say it’s going to last to the middle of next year.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"But with your concerns about the potential for upside risks to inflation, would you think you might need to have liftoff happen before you finish the tapering?"
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s not my expectation.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"Of course, we can always—we haven’t decided to taper yet, and we haven’t decided the pace yet."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, you know, it’s not my expectation that we would have to."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"We can certainly speed up or slow down the taper if we—if it becomes appropriate, though."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,Absolutely.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"In fact, back in ’13, when we tapered, we always said we weren’t on a preset course."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,I think this will be a shorter period.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,So it makes sense to allow the runoff to happen.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"I believe that the report was supposed to come this summer, and indications that it’s going to come this month."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"But the drumbeat seems to be kind of getting louder to see where the Fed’s heading on this, and just wondering if you can provide some update there."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,I was just wondering if—okay—are you concerned at all with kind of falling behind in the global race for digital currencies?
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,I think it’s important that we get to a place where we can make an informed decision about this and do so expeditiously.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,I don’t think we’re behind.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,I think it’s more important to do this right than to do it fast.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,We are the world’s reserve currency.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I think we’re in a good place to make that analysis and make that decision—by the way, which will be a governmentwide decision."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"We would do this, we would have to have a meeting of the minds with the Administration and also probably with Congress."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,We would really like to have broad support for this.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s a very important innovation.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I think we would need that to go ahead, and that’s the process we’re engaged in."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks very much.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"If you look at the last two or three years of, before the pandemic hit, you saw—after a lot of long progress, you saw a really strong labor market."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,If I could have a quick—could I get a quick follow on that?
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,JEFF COX.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you very much.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"Sure, I’d be glad to."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,So we think it’s really important that the central bank maintain a stable currency and payment system for the public’s benefit.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s one of our jobs.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"We also live in a time of transformational innovation around digital payments, and we need to make sure that the Fed is able to continue to deliver to the public a stable and trustworthy currency and payment system."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"So there’s extensive private innovation, a lot of which is taking place outside the regulatory perimeter."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,And innovation is fantastic.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,Our economy runs on innovation.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,HEATHER SCOTT.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"But where the public’s money is concerned, we need to make sure that appropriate regulatory protections are in place, and today they really are not in some cases."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"We have two broad workstreams, one of which is really technology, both at the Board and in the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston’s work with MIT—the other of which is to identify, scope out, deal with, analyze the various public policy issues."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"As you mentioned, we do intend to publish a discussion paper soon that will be the basis for a period of public engagement— engagement with many different groups, including elected officials, around these issues."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"We think it’s our obligation to do the work, both on technology and public policy, to form a basis for making an informed decision."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,The ultimate test we’ll apply when assessing a central bank digital currency and other digital innovations is: Are there clear and tangible benefits that outweigh any costs and risks?
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’re also, as you know, investing heavily right now in building a new settlement system for instant payments in the U.S. It’ll be the first such major expansion of our core payment system since the 1970s."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"We found the case for this quite compelling—for consumers, businesses, and just ensuring that all financial institutions have access to that payment system."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, bottom line, we haven’t made a decision about the CBDC, but we will be issuing a discussion paper soon in order to form the basis of this public interaction that we’ll have."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"So with that in mind and with the creation of myriad private currencies and currency-like products, we’re working proactively to evaluate whether to issue a CBDC and, if so, in what form."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,Let’s go to Heather Scott.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, again, we watch carefully."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,Let’s go to Greg Robb.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"—I’m focused on doing my job every day for the American people, and I don’t have any comment on that, Brian."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,Sorry about that.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,Let’s go to Greg Robb.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,GREG ROBB.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thanks for taking my question, Chair Powell."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"I was wondering if, in your discussion about the tapering that—you said that officials think it’s appropriate to end around the middle of the year—if there was any discussion about what happens to the balance sheet then."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,I’ve heard some Fed officials say that they wouldn’t shrink the balance sheet.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,Was that discussed?
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,And what’s your stance on shrinking the balance sheet?
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,I’m focused on doing my job— MICHELLE SMITH.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,I think the phrase goes: “I have nothing for you on that today.” Sorry.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, the Evergrande situation seems very particular to China, which has very high debt for an emerging market economy, really the highest that any emerging market economy has had."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,And the government has been working to get that under control.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,This is part of that effort.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,The government put new strictures in place for highly leveraged companies.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"And Evergrande is dealing with those strictures, and it’s something they’re managing."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"In terms of the implications for us, there isn’t, there’s not a lot of direct United States exposure."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,The big Chinese banks are not tremendously exposed.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"So my thinking on this has been: Let’s get through the taper decision, and then let’s turn to those issues."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, you know, you would worry that it would affect global financial conditions through confidence channels and that kind of thing."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,We’ll go to Brian Cheung.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,BRIAN CHEUNG.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Chairman Powell."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,Just wondering if you could give us an update on whether or not you’ve had conversations with the White House about a possible reappointment.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,And then whether or not you would like to be reappointed as this chatter kind of builds up.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,But I wouldn’t draw a parallel to the United States corporate sector.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"It was a, you know, a much stronger response than we’ve ever had."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"There are a number of related issues that—you mentioned one, Greg, but, you know, and—which you need to start to think about, and we’ll do that."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, we do have the experience of what we did last time."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,And that’s also what expectations are showing.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"So there are many, many different inflation measures, of course."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"And that’s why we have this thing called the CIE, which is the, it’s an index of—it’s market-based measures, it’s professional forecasters, and it’s household surveys."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"And you just put them all—it’s not, you know, it doesn’t have a lot of grand theory about it."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"You put them all in, and you measure the change."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"So you should be—and, also, you measure things like the dispersion and that sort of thing, so you can look at all that."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, it tells a story of inflation expectations moving up."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"Many of the different measures will also show inflation expectations moving back up to where they were in, say, 2013, which was before the really—the drop in inflation expectations broadly happened in ’14 and ’15—around then."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,So that’s not a troubling thing.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, you know, inflation expectations are terribly important."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,We spend a lot of time watching them.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"And if we did see them moving up in a troubling way and running persistently above levels that are really consistent with our mandate, then, you know, we would certainly react to that."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,But we don’t really see that now.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,We see more of a moderate increase that is—the first part of which is welcome.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"And because, you know, inflation expectations had drifted down, and it was good to see them get back up a bit."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"For the most part, surveys are showing that households expect higher inflation in the near term but not in the longer term."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,And it seems like there’s a high correlation between three-year and one-year.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s only an eight-year-old survey, and it does seem as though the, they’re looking three years out."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"The New York Fed survey, let me talk about that specifically, and this is from the New York Fed."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,We’ve watched other countries and what they’ve done.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,So I think we’ll be able to get to sensible decisions fairly expeditiously when it’s time.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"But it’s just not time yet, in my thinking."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,GREG ROBB.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"But I want to get, we want to get through this taper decision, and then turn to those issues, rather than start, you know, thinking about them now and having the minutes discuss them and get people thinking that we are, you know, focused on those issues, because we’re really not."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,Let’s go to Scott Horsley.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,You talked a little bit about inflation expectations.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"And there does seem to be something of a divide between market expectations and the views of professional economists—which are pretty much in line with the FOMC members—and laypeople’s expectations, at least as reflected in the recent New York Fed survey."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,How much weight do you put on laypeople’s expectations?
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,And what do you think accounts for that divide?
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,So within—let’s just take the household surveys generally.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,SCOTT HORSLEY.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,So we all saw the benefits of a strong labor market.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,And I’m wondering if a 6.1 percent unemployment rate for African Americans is consistent with full employment or whether it would need to be lower as part of your inclusive growth strategy.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,So we will do all of that.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"In terms of the framework, I see this as very consistent with the framework."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,We want inflation expectations to be anchored at around 2 percent.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"We want, we’re—that’s really the ultimate test of whether we’re getting this done under the framework."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, we do want inflation to run moderately above 2 percent."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,I wouldn’t put too much on a couple of tenths over 2 percent in 2023 and ’24—one-tenth in ’24.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"But you’re right, those are the numbers."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,Let’s go to Colby Smith.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,COLBY SMITH.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"Chair Powell—thank you, Michelle."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"Chair Powell, you mentioned ongoing discussions about the tapering timeline, and I’m wondering what the contours of that debate have been."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"For those that want to move a bit more quickly, is it about maintaining optionality for a 2022 interest rate increase?"
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,Or is it about financial stability risks?
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,Or concerns about the efficacy of asset purchases at a time when we have supply constraints?
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, we want to foster a strong labor market, and we want to foster inflation averaging 2 percent over time, and I think we’re very much on track to achieve those things."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,That just happens to be people’s forecasts.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"You’re looking at 2.2 and 2.1, you know, two years and three years out."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,We’ll go to Howard Schneider.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,HOWARD SCHNEIDER.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thanks, Chair Powell."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thanks, Michelle."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, looking at the SEPs, we got now basically four years of inflation above target, and policy never gets to the long-run rate."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"I’m wondering if you could address that from two perspectives: one, within the new framework that the Fed adopted last year and, second, from the perspective of the average household that’s now being asked to pay higher prices and increasingly higher prices for four years running when, for some this year, real wages have actually gone down."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,Sure.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, as you can see, the inflation forecasts have moved up a bit in the outyears."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"And that’s really, I think, a reflection of—and they’ve moved up significantly for this year."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"And that’s, I think, a reflection of the fact that the bottlenecks and shortages that are being—that we’re seeing in the economy have really not begun to abate in a meaningful way yet."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,So those seem to be going to be with us at least for a few more months and perhaps into next year.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"So that suggests that inflation’s going to be higher this year, and a number—I guess the inflation rates for next year and 2023 were also marked up, but just by a couple of tenths."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,Why—those are very modest overshoots.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"These are very, very—I don’t think that households are going to, you know, notice a couple of tenths of an overshoot."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"So let me say that there’s very broad support on the Committee for this plan, both as to the timing and as to the pace of the taper."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"So this was a unanimous vote today, and I’d say quite broad support for this approach."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,Does the Committee have a different opinion than you do about the threshold for liftoff that you’ve articulated?
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,Or do they believe that either inflation or economic growth will necessitate a rate increase sooner than you do?
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"Well, so, again, substantial further progress toward our goals is the test for beginning the taper."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,And the taper takes some months in everyone’s figuring.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,So you’re going to be well away from satisfying the liftoff test when we begin the taper.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"So in terms of the liftoff test, though, you know, it’s what we adopted last September."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s labor market conditions consistent with maximum employment.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"And while we have interesting signs that, in many ways, the labor market’s very tight, we also have lots of slack in the labor market, and we think that those imbalances will sort themself out."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"Inflation at 2 percent and on track to achieve it, moderately higher inflation over 2 percent—you know, that really depends on the path of inflation."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"If inflation remains higher during the course of 2022, then we may already have met that test by the time we reach liftoff."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I just think, if you look at what people are writing down for year-end 2022 numbers, some people are writing down very low unemployment rates."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"And that’s only one indicator, but it suggests a very strong labor market."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,And I think they’re writing down in good faith what they see as meeting the test.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"There’s a range of perspectives about where the economy will be, but— by the way, all but one participants have us lifting off during 2023."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"But if the near-term projections today are credible, more of your colleagues seem to think that rate liftoff, and not just a taper, may be closer at hand."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"Chair Powell, you have said the test for liftoff is more stringent than the test for tapering."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,NICK TIMIRAOS.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"You’re correct that there are some who would prefer to have gone sooner, and they’ve made their arguments publicly."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"For some of them, it’s a financial stability concern."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"And for others, it’s other concerns."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,They can make their own arguments.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"This is an approach that the Committee will broadly support, and it will put us having completed our taper sometime around the middle of next year, which seems appropriate."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, the asset purchases, as I mentioned, were very, very important at the—in the early stages of the crisis."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,They were essential in restoring market function in the Treasury and other markets.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"The Committee will consider that test, and we’ll also look at the broader environment at that time and make a decision whether to taper."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"Then, as the recovery got going, they supported aggregate demand, as they will do."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,Their usefulness is much less as a tool than it was at the very beginning.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, of course, this leaves the whole question of rate increases ahead, which is really where the framework—the framework is all about how we deal with rate increases and that sort of thing."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,So we think this is the appropriate way to go.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, again, broad support on the Committee."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,We’ll go to Nick Timiraos.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"And now we’re in a situation where they still have a use, but it’s time for us to begin to taper them."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,So it’s not really an unusually wide array of views about this.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"And so, once we’ve met those two tests, once the Committee decides that they’ve met [them]—and that could come as soon as the next meeting; that’s the purpose of that language, is to put notice out that that could come as soon as the next meeting."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,There’s a range of perspectives.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"These factors should diminish with progress on containing the virus, leading to more rapid gains in employment."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"Looking ahead, FOMC participants project the labor market to continue to improve, with the median projection for the unemployment rate standing at 4.8 percent at the end of this year and 3.5 percent in 2023 and ’24."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"The economic downturn has not fallen equally on all Americans, and those least able to shoulder the burden have been hardest hit."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"In particular, despite progress, joblessness continues to fall disproportionately on lower-wage workers in the service sector and on African Americans and Hispanics."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,Inflation is elevated and will likely remain so in coming months before moderating.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"As the economy continues to reopen and spending rebounds, we are seeing upward pressure on prices, particularly because supply bottlenecks in some sectors have limited how quickly production can respond in the near term."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"These bottleneck effects have been larger and longer lasting than anticipated, leading to upward revisions to participants’ inflation projections for this year."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"While these supply effects are prominent for now, they will abate, and as they do, inflation is expected to drop back toward our longer-run goal."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,The median inflation projection from FOMC participants falls from 4.2 percent this year to 2.2 percent next year.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"The process of reopening the economy is unprecedented, as was the shutdown at the onset of the pandemic."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"As the reopening continues, bottlenecks, hiring difficulties, and other constraints could again prove to be greater and longer lasting than anticipated, posing upside risks to inflation."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"Our framework for monetary policy emphasizes the importance of having well-anchored inflation expectations, both to foster price stability and to enhance our ability to promote our broad-based and inclusive maximum-employment goal."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,Indicators of longer-term inflation expectations appear broadly consistent with our longer-run inflation goal of 2 percent.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"If sustained higher inflation were to become a serious concern, we would certainly respond and use our tools to assure that inflation runs at levels that are consistent with our goal."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"The path of the economy continues to depend on the course of the virus, and risks to the economic outlook remain."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"Factors related to the pandemic, such as caregiving needs and ongoing fears of the virus, appear to be weighing on employment growth."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"The Delta variant has led to significant increases in COVID-19 cases, resulting in significant hardship and loss and slowing the economic recovery."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"The unemployment rate was 5.2 percent in August, and this figure understates the shortfall in employment, particularly as participation in the labor market has not moved up from the low rates that have prevailed for most of the past year."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"Demand for labor is very strong, and job gains averaged 750,000 per month over the past three months."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I think if you look back, what were we really thinking?"
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"Transcript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference September 22, 2021 CHAIR POWELL."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,Good afternoon.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"At the Federal Reserve, we are strongly committed to achieving the monetary policy goals that Congress has given us: maximum employment and price stability."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"Today, the Federal Open Market Committee kept interest rates near zero and maintained our current pace of asset purchases."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"These measures, along with our strong guidance on interest rates and on our balance sheet, will ensure that monetary policy will continue to support the economy until the recovery is complete."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,Progress on vaccinations and unprecedented fiscal policy actions are also providing strong support to the recovery.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,Indicators of economic activity and employment have continued to strengthen.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"Real GDP rose at a robust 6.4 percent pace in the first half of the year, and growth is widely expected to continue at a strong pace in the second half."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"The sectors most adversely affected by the pandemic have improved in recent months, but the rise in COVID-19 cases has slowed their recovery."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"Household spending rose at an especially rapid pace over the first half of the year but flattened out in July and August as spending softened in COVID-sensitive sectors, such as travel and restaurants."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"Additionally, in some industries, near-term supply constraints are restraining activity."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"These constraints are particularly acute in the motor vehicle industry, where the worldwide shortage of semiconductors has sharply curtailed production."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"Partly reflecting the effects of the virus and supply constraints, forecasts from FOMC participants for economic growth this year have been revised somewhat lower since our June Summary of Economic Projections, but participants still foresee rapid growth."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"As with overall economic activity, conditions in the labor market have continued to improve."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"In August, however, job gains slowed markedly, with the slowdown concentrated in sectors most sensitive to the pandemic, including leisure and hospitality."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,Continued progress on vaccinations would help contain the virus and support a return to more normal economic conditions.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"The Fed’s policy actions have been guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people, along with our responsibilities to promote the stability of the financial system."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,Our asset purchases have been a critical tool.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,RACHEL SIEGEL.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you, Michelle."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"And thank you, Chair Powell, for taking our questions."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"When it comes to the taper and, eventually, to any rate increases, I’m wondering if you can walk us through what “substantial further progress” looks like, given the latest batch of projections that have PCE inflation coming in a little higher than the June projection, the unemployment rate also being higher than June, as well as the change to GDP lower than June."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"If you could help us make sense of all those things as you sort through what “substantial further progress” looks like, that would be great."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,Sure.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,So the test for beginning our taper is that we’ve achieved substantial further progress toward our goals of [2 percent] inflation and maximum employment.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"And for inflation, we appear to have achieved more than significant progress—substantial further progress."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"So that part of the test is achieved, in my view and in the view of many others."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,So the question is really on the maximum-employment test.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"So if you look at a good number of indicators, you will see that, since last December, when we articulated the test, and the readings today, in many cases more than half of the distance, for example, between the unemployment rate in December of 2020 and typical estimates of the natural rate—50 or 60 percent of that road has been traveled."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,So that could be substantial further progress.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,Many on the Committee feel that the “substantial further progress” test for employment has been met.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"Others feel that it’s close, but they want to see a little more progress."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,We’ll go first to Rachel Siegel.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you, and I look forward to your questions."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,They helped preserve financial stability and market functioning early in the pandemic and since then have helped foster accommodative financial conditions to support the economy.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"At our meeting that concluded earlier today, the Committee continued to discuss the progress made toward our goals since the Committee adopted its asset purchase guidance last December."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"Since then, the economy has made progress toward these goals."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"If progress continues broadly as expected, the Committee judges that a moderation in the pace of asset purchases may soon be warranted."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,We also discussed the appropriate pace of tapering asset purchases once economic conditions satisfy the criterion laid out in the Committee’s guidance.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"While no decisions were made, participants generally view that, so long as the recovery remains on track, a gradual tapering process that concludes around the middle of next year is likely to be appropriate."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"Even after our balance sheet stops expanding, our elevated holdings of longer-term securities will continue to support accommodative financial conditions."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,I guess my own view would be that the test—the “substantial further progress” test for employment is all but met.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"The timing and pace of the coming reduction in asset purchases will not be intended to carry a direct signal regarding the timing of interest rate liftoff, for which we have articulated a different and substantially more stringent test."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"Half of FOMC participants forecast that these favorable economic conditions will be fulfilled by the end of next year; as a result, the median projection for the appropriate level of the federal funds rate lies slightly above the effective lower bound in 2022."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,Participants generally expect a gradual pace of policy firming that would leave the level of the federal funds rate below estimates of its longer-run level through 2024.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"Of course, these projections do not represent a Committee decision or plan, and no one knows with any certainty where the economy will be a year or more from now."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,More important than any forecast is the fact that policy will remain accommodative until we have achieved our maximum-employment and price-stability goals.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"To conclude, we understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,Everything we do is in service to our public mission.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,We at the Fed will do everything we can to support the economy for as long as it takes to complete the recovery.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,We continue to expect that it will be appropriate to maintain the current 0 to ¼ percent target range for the federal funds rate until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee’s assessment of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time.

2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"But it still seems that, inexorably, people will—these are people who were largely working back in February of 2020."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,They’ll get back to work when it’s time to do that.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,It just may take a longer time.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"You’re right, though—it didn’t happen with any force in September, and a lot of that was Delta."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,In terms of the—you asked also about the test for November.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think if the economy continues to progress broadly in line with expectations, then I think—and also the overall situation is appropriate for this, then I think we could easily move ahead at the next meeting."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"Or not, depending on whether we feel like that, those tests are met."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,CHRIS RUGABER.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"Well, just a quick—if I could just quickly follow up, I mean, what, how much of that will depend on what kind of jobs report we get for September?"
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, I mean, is it, you know, are you in a data-dependent phase here where you need to see certain numbers going ahead?"
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,Or are we at a point where you’ve accumulated enough progress that— CHAIR POWELL.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"So it is, it’s accumulated progress."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, you know, for me, it wouldn’t take a knockout, great, super strong employment report."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,It would take a reasonably good employment report for me to feel like that test is met.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,And others on the Committee—many on the Committee feel that the test is already met.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,I think there’s still—it may just be that it’s going to take more time.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,Others want to see more progress.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,And so what we—we know things that didn’t happen.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we—so that—really, the big shortfall in labor, in jobs, was largely in travel and leisure, and that’s because of—clearly because of Delta."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,You mentioned in the past the extra unemployment benefits expiring.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,There’s some real-time data suggesting that we may not be seeing much of a return of labor supply.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,So do you still expect to see that in the next couple of jobs reports?
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,And how would a relatively weak jobs report in September affect your plans?
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, you’re right, we have a—really, I’ll call it a unique situation where, by many measures, the labor market is tight."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"And 11 million job openings, very widespread reports from employers all over the economy saying it’s quite difficult to hire people, wages moving up, and that kind—so, quite a tight labor market."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"So our view, I think— widespread view a few months ago was that several things were coming together in the fall, including kids back to school, which would, you know, which would lighten caregiving duties, including the expiration of unemployment—extra unemployment benefits, and other things would come together to provide an increase in labor supply, and so we’d get out of this strange world where there’re lots of unemployed people and a high unemployment rate but a labor shortage."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"And so what happened was, Delta happened."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,And you had this very sharp spike in Delta cases.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I think, so that affects—for example, when schools are open 60 percent of the time or when they’re always at a threat of being closed because of Delta, the Delta variant, you know, you might want to wait."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"Rather than going ahead and taking a job and starting work only to have to quit it three weeks later, you’re going to wait until you’re confident of that."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,So some of that may not have happened.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"Also, people didn’t, you know—as you know, hiring and spending in these face-to-face service industries, travel and leisure, it just kind of stopped during those months."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,So that all happened.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, we’ll work it out as we go."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"But I would say that, in my own thinking, the test is all but met."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I don’t personally need to see a very strong employment report, but I’d like to see a good—a decent employment report."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"I respect that that’s the person who will set the regulatory agenda going forward, and I would accept that."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, furthermore, you know, it’s fully appropriate to look at—for a new person to come in and look at the current state of regulation and supervision and suggest appropriate changes, and I welcome that."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"In terms of Vice Chair Quarles’s term, we’re not currently in that situation, and I actually don’t have any updates for you on that today."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,We’ll keep you posted on that.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,We’ll go to Steve Matthews at Bloomberg.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,STEVE MATTHEWS.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"Chair Powell, I wanted to ask about the inclusive monetary policy framework."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"In particular, Bloomberg surveyed economists, and we found that they predict liftoff will happen when the U.S. unemployment rate is 3.8 percent but the Black unemployment rate is 6.1 percent."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"Right, so the point of the broad and inclusive goal was not to target a particular unemployment rate for any particular group."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"Really, we look at a broad range of—a very broad range of metrics when we think about what maximum employment is."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I would, I think—I respect that authority."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"Dan Tarullo certainly did it, and Vice Chair Quarles did it as well."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"And in the 10 years, almost, that I’ve been at the Fed, that person has really done that."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, it’s a specific grant of authority."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mean, it’s not, it’s, again, it’s not to be confused with the test for liftoff, which is so much higher."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,CHRIS RUGABER.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,Great.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,Okay.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"You and other Fed officials have often talked about expecting a job market pickup in September as more children return to school, freeing up more parents to work, COVID abating."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,We’ll go to Victoria Guida.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Chair Powell."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,So I wanted to ask about the Vice Chair of Supervision position and just—I was wondering if you could speak about how you view that role and the extent to which you defer to that person on regulatory policy.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"And then, just sort of a related question: As you know, Randy Quarles’s vice chairmanship ends next month, and I was wondering if he’s going to retain the supervisory portfolio until he’s replaced in that role."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,Sure.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"So Dodd-Frank created this position, Vice Chair for Supervision, and it’s, there’s actually a specific assignment in the Dodd-Frank language, as I’m sure you know."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, effectively, what it means is that the Vice Chair for Supervision is charged with setting the regulatory agenda."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,VICTORIA GUIDA.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,Wider question about jobs and the Fed’s schedule—the Fed’s policy framework that you laid out here.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,And one of the things we look at is unemployment rates and participation rates and wages for different demographic and age groups and that kind of thing.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"We need to make changes, and we’re going to do that as a consequence of this."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,This will be a thoroughgoing and comprehensive review.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,We’re going to gather all the facts and look at ways to further tighten our rules and standards.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,Great.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,We’ll go to Steve Liesman.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,STEVE LIESMAN.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"I want to follow up on Jeanna’s question, the issue of ownership of these stocks and trades."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,Do you think it’s appropriate for Federal Reserve officials to be owning the same assets that the Federal Reserve is buying?
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,Is that one of the modifications that you’re looking at?
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"And in that these—you said yourself, they’re clearly not seen as appropriate."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"In that the Fed’s code of conduct says Fed officials should avoid even the appearance of the, of conflict, do those trades, in fact—and holdings—violate the Fed’s code of conduct?"
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,The other thing you would say—that it is now clearly seen as not adequate to the task of really sustaining the public’s trust in us.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"This has been our framework for a long time, and I guess you’d say it’s served us well."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, you know, I would have had to go back and read people’s financial disclosures to know what their activities have been."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"So all of these—everyone’s, you know, ownership and activities are all disclosed on an annual basis."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you, Chair Powell."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,JEANNA SMIALEK.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hey, Chair Powell—thank you for taking our questions."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"Prior to recent media reports, were you aware of the kind of security buying and selling that Presidents Kaplan and Rosengren were participating in last year?"
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,And I wonder if you thought those were appropriate.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, no, I was not aware of the specifics of what they were doing."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"Finally, do you have a timeline as to when you might get—be done with your review?"
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,So let me just say a couple things about this subject.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,And that’s why I directed the Fed to begin a comprehensive review of the ethics rules around permissible financial holdings and activity by Fed officials.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"So those rules are, in many respects, the same as those for government agencies, plus a number of things that apply specifically to us because of our business."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"One of those is—sort of, three things I would point to in terms of specific restrictures."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"One is, ownership of certain assets is not allowed, and that’s bank securities and other things."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"Secondly, there are times when we’re not allowed to trade at all or to, you know, buy and sell financial assets."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,And that’s the period immediately before and during an FOMC meeting.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, third, there’s regular disclosure."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,We understand very well that the trust of the American people is essential for us to effectively carry out our mission.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you, sir."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,We’ll go to Jeanna Smialek.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,Don’t have a timeline yet; we can start with that.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,I think that’s a reasonable thing.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"Yeah, and, of course, for the most part, we don’t."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mean, it was a real coincidence; I happened to pre-own these munis."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"They were bought many years ago, actually."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,And so we started buying munis as part of the Municipal Liquidity Facility.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I couldn’t sell them, so what I did was, I just held them, checked with the ethics people, and went ahead."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, but as a general principle, yeah, that makes a lot of sense."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,STEVE LIESMAN.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,We’ll go to Chris Rugaber.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,CHRIS RUGABER.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,Is that— CHAIR POWELL.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"When you said “right,” about that the Feds should not own—Federal Reserve officials should not own the same assets they’re buying?"
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,So it was really not a—it just was an unforeseen event.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"I’m sorry, Chair Powell—I just want to follow up."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,You said I was right.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, I personally owned municipal securities for many, many years, and in 2019, I froze that."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"Meaning I—they’re no—I’m holding all those securities, my wife and I, to maturity."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"And munis were always thought to be a pretty safe place for a Fed person to invest because, as you know, the lore was that the Fed would never buy municipal securities."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,So it was not an uncommon thing.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"And the reason was that the financial markets, including the municipal financial market, were very much on the verge of collapse."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"And it was time to go, and we did."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"And so then comes the, you know, the COVID crisis, and I reversed that policy, and I did it without hesitating."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,So that’s one answer that I wanted to share with you.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, well, let me address the muni question, since that’s in there."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"Secondly, you’re right, though, as—we’re going to be looking at all those things."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,I don’t want to get ahead of the process here and speculate about particular outcomes.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"But this, again, comprehensive and deliberate process—we’re going to make changes."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"I want to be able to look back on this years from now and know that we rose to meet this challenge and handled the situation well, and that what we did made a lot of sense and protected the public’s interest and the institution that we’re all a part of."
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,STEVE LIESMAN.
2021-09-22,Press Conf - Full Text,But we also checked with the Office of Government Ethics and—who looked carefully at it and said that I didn’t have a conflict.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"That is my baseline understanding, and that’s a very widely held one among people."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, I think, you know, the bottlenecks that we’re seeing in global supply chains around goods and, frankly, now at our own domestic ports, because demand is stronger than the capacity of those ports—those things are going to work themselves out."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,We have a flexible economy.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’ll take some time, but, you know, it took—you know, the experts managed to create a vaccine faster than, certainly, than I expected."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,And I think this stuff will work itself out over the course of next year.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, you know, we are prepared for different eventualities, and we will use our tools to achieve price stability and maximum employment."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Chair Powell."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Our policy will adapt—and has already adapted—to the changing understanding of inflation and of bottlenecks and the whole supply-side story—which is also partly a demand story.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,So our policy will continue to adapt as is appropriate.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Let’s go to Nancy Marshall-Genzer at Marketplace.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s when we’re really going to see what the characteristics of the labor market are.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,And we’re going to let the data lead us to where we need to go.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we don’t want to stop that when there’s good reason to think—there’s still good reason to think, although it’s been delayed, clearly, there’s good reason to think that the economy will reopen, particularly if we do get past, you know, significant outbreaks of COVID."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Mr. Chairman, the critics of your patience policy argue that, given the long and variable lags with which monetary policy works, that you are likely to end up, given inflation, by having to raise rates faster and farther than you would have liked and, therefore, send the economy into recession."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Certainly, I don’t know anyone arguing for that today."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"That will drive down longer-term rates and hold them lower, and, you know, rates right across the, right across the rate spectrum matter for borrowers."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Given the fact that, basically, your forecast has been chasing inflation over the last year, and now you’re talking about it not coming down until the second or third quarter, why would they be wrong in thinking that?"
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Well, so, let me say what’s happened—and we’re very, very straightforward about it—is that inflation has come in higher than expected, and bottlenecks have been more persistent and more prevalent."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"We see that just like everybody else does, and we see that they’re now on track to persist well into next year."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"That was not expected—not expected by us, not expected by other macro forecasters."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Now, let me say, you know, it’s difficult enough to just forecast the economy in normal times."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,And the reason is that there’s still ground to cover to get to maximum employment.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"When you’re talking about, you know, global supply chains in turmoil, it’s a whole different thing."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"So it’s very, very difficult to forecast and not easy to set policy."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we have to set policy, though."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,So that’s what we’re doing.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, so, to look at your question this way, I don’t think that we’re behind the curve."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"I actually believe that policy is well positioned to address the range of plausible outcomes, and that’s what we need to do."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,I do think it would be premature to raise rates today.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s not—I don’t think that’s controversial.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"And you’re talking about a pandemic that’s holding people out of the labor force for reasons that we can sample, but we don’t have a lot of experience with this."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks for taking our questions.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"And then, in a related question, do you have any greater insight into what Fed bond buying actually does for the economy?"
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,So why are you tapering faster this time?
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we’ll do it in an orderly fashion, and we’ll talk about reinvestment and all those things."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,And we don’t have to make decisions on those yet.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, you know, typically, when we’re doing a new subject like that, we’ll have a series of briefings and discussions."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,And that’s what we will now begin to do.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"In terms of the effect of asset purchases on the economy, so, there’s a tremendous amount of research and scholarship on this."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, you can kind of—you can find different people coming out with different views."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"But I would say, the most mainstream view would be that you’re at the effective lower bound, so how do you affect longer-term rates?"
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,There are two ways.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"One, so you can’t lower rates—let’s say you can’t lower rates any further, hypothetically."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,So you can give forward guidance.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"You can say, we’re going to keep the rates low for a period of time, either [for] a specific period, [or] until certain conditions are met."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"The markets will do the math, and that’ll have an effect on longer-term borrowings even, you know, 10, 30 years out kind of thing."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,So that’s one thing.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"The other thing you can do is, you just go buy those securities, buy longer-term securities."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHAEL MCKEE.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Now that we’ve tapered, I expect that that’s exactly what we’ll do in coming meetings."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"So in terms of the balance sheet, those questions that you mention—we haven’t gone back to them."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Sure.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"The economy is in quite a different place than when we tapered back in, I guess it was, 2013."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,We were much farther away from maximum employment.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Inflation was much lower.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"This is an economy where demand is very, very strong, very strong, and job openings substantially exceed the number of unemployed people."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"So the need for further stimulus is far less than it was in 2013, where we still had quite a ways to go."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mean, after we began that taper, it was still many years before we reached what I would characterize as conditions consistent with maximum employment, let alone price stability."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"So you announced that the Fed is going to taper at a rate of, starting at $15 billion a month, and that’s more than twice the pace of the last taper."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"So this is quite a different situation, and, you know, the Committee unanimously felt today that we had met the test that we’d articulated, and this was appropriate."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s earlier and faster, and that’s because our, as I mentioned, our policy has been adapting to the situation as it evolves, as it’s clarifying itself, and that’s partly because we see inflation coming in higher—so."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Let’s go to Mike Derby.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Yes, thank you for taking my question."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"I wonder if the Fed has given any thoughts yet to the endgame for the balance sheet in terms of, you know, once you get the taper process complete, will you hold the balance sheet steady, or will you allow it to start passively winding down?"
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"In terms of its economic impact, have you been able to, you know, measure it or quantify it in any fashion, you know, because I’m sure you know there’s often been questions about, what is bond buying actually doing to help the economy?"
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"And this is faster than, you know, than what people had expected six months ago."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,We’ll go to Mike McKee at Bloomberg.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Within the frame of our existing mandates, we’ll do it well."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for taking the call."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,So the Federal Reserve—I want to talk about climate change.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,The Federal Reserve released a statement today—says “the Federal Reserve supports the efforts .
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,to identify key issues and potential solutions for the climate-related challenges most relevant to central banks and supervisory” outcomes.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Is this putting us on the path to regulate what banks can offer loans on or invest in, like coal plants or fossil fuels?"
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,So that’s not a decision for bank regulators or for any agency.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s a decision for elected representatives.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,So we feel that any role that we have—and we do think we have a role in climate change.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"It relates to our existing mandates, and our existing mandates are, really, prudential regulation of financial institutions."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"We expect them, and the public will expect us to expect them, to understand and be in a position to manage their risks."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"So that’s physical risk, and it’s transition risk for climate."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, by the way, the large financial institutions are doing this already, and, you know, we think that’s right within our mandate."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,EDWARD LAWRENCE.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"There’s also a financial stability question, the overall stability of the financial system."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Let’s go to Edward Lawrence at Fox Business.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"So lower rates encourage more borrowing, encourage more economic activity."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I think, though, that, judgmentally, too, it’s appropriate to be patient."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s appropriate for us to see what the labor market and what the economy look like when they heal further.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"We know that we were on a path to a different place, as I mentioned, when Delta arrived."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"And Delta stopped, it stopped job creation."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,It stopped that transition away from a goods-focused economy where there’s excess demand for goods because there—services are not available.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,People are not traveling.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"That transition itself could help bring inflation down, because, presumably, people would spend a little less on goods while they start spending more on travel and all sorts of travel services and things like that."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we want to see that healthy process unfold as we decide what the true state of the economy is, and we think it will evolve in a way that will mean lower inflation."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Bottlenecks should be abating.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"We start to see that now with some of them, but, overall, they haven’t gotten better overall, and, you know, we’re very aware of that."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,So that’s really how we’re thinking about it.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,We’re thinking that time will tell us more.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"In the meantime, we don’t think it’s time to raise rates now."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, if we do conclude that it’s necessary to do so, then we’ll be patient, but we won’t hesitate."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"And so, from that standpoint, we can do research."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,We can try to help understand what will the pathways be through which climate change effects the economy—both physical risk and transition risk.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"That’s what we can do, and that’s what we will do."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,And I feel like this called that into question.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we reacted, I would characterize it, strongly and forcefully."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"If there were other things that we could do that were reasonable, we would certainly do them."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,So you asked me about blind trusts.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, the overall authority for ethics around these issues in the federal government is the Office of Government Ethics, OGE."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,And they have a long-held position which is not favorable to blind trusts.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,They do not encourage them.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,They don’t think they’re effective.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,They think they’re cumbersome.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,And they think there are better ways to get at the things that need to be done.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,And those are the things that we’re actually doing.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I don’t know that there are any blind trusts, for that reason, because they are the, they’re the regulator."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"They say this on their website, if you look."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"In terms of laws broken, you know, I asked the inspector general to look to see whether there were rules broken and whether there were laws broken, and I won’t speculate on that."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"But that is with the inspector general now and, of course, out of my hands."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, within one FOMC cycle, we announced a new set of rules to, you know, to try to put us back where we need to be, which is, we need to have the complete trust of the American people that we’re working in their interest all the time—absolutely critical to our work, as it is for any government agency."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"As a group, we stepped in, and we took the actions that we took."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,And so we had no moment of denial about that.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we, you know, we—let me just say that this system, the ethics system we had in place had been in place for decades and had, as far as we know, served us well, and then that was no longer the case."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,And we’ll do it well.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,We’re not the people who will decide the national strategy on climate change.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"That has to be elected people, and not so much us."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"We feel like we have that narrow mandate, and we will do it well."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,EDWARD LAWRENCE.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Great, thank you."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,VICTORIA GUIDA.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Chair Powell."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"So the Fed recently announced that there is going to be new conflict-of-interest rules for investments by Fed officials, and this follows, obviously, the resignation of two regional Fed presidents."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I’m just wondering, do you think that there is more that you will need to do to rebuild the credibility of the Fed, such as, you know, requiring officials to put their assets in blind trusts?"
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"And also, if you could speak to whether you have any concerns that any rules or laws were broken by Fed officials."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Victoria Guida at Politico.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,People—you can service your debt.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,So that’s how we’re thinking about it.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, it’s not different from what we do at the short end."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,BRIAN CHEUNG.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"When you say you spoke with Administration officials, did that include the President?"
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,I’m not going to answer who I spoke to at all.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"I just, I’m not going to give you any names, so don’t take that as a “yes” or “no.” I’m just not going to start down that road."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Okay.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,We’re going to go to Jeff Cox for the last question.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,JEFF COX.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Yes, thank you."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Chair, I just want to dig a little bit deeper on employment."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’ve seen what’s been called the great resignation, folks leaving their jobs in record numbers."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Is there any feeling there that maybe you’ve been accused of “fighting the last war”—that perhaps the labor dynamics have changed in the post-COVID environment and that full employment may not look like what it looked like before?
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, again, if there are better ideas, I’d love to hear them, but I think we have so far made a good start."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Yes.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,I’m totally committed to doing that.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,We are where we are.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,And it was in place when I took over.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"It was in place for the last, at least the last three or four Chairs."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, it was what it was."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, it proved to have weaknesses in it."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"And part of that was, it wasn’t uniformly enforced across the System."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,I’m a big believer in the value of the Federal Reserve System and the Reserve Banks.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,But you had 12 different ethics officers at 12 different Banks.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,And you had ethics people here.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, compliance wasn’t, it wasn’t all exactly the same."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"It was a little bit different and uneven, and also, the rules were— you know, we didn’t imagine the problems that happened."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,And they may have actually been—I don’t know this—but they may actually have been in compliance with the specifics of our rules.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"They were clearly not in compliance with the part of our rules that said, don’t do anything that would create that appearance."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mean, that’s clear."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,This was a bad appearance.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, anyway, what can we do?"
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"It happened, and we just have to deal with it forthrightly and transparently and “own” it and step up to this, you know, meet this moment."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, what’s happening is, people are leaving their jobs."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"They’re quitting their jobs in all-time-high numbers—but, in many cases, going back into employment and getting higher wages."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,So a lot of the higher wages you’re seeing are for job switchers rather than incumbents.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think we have to—I’m very open to the thought that it’s going to be an empirical question of where it is located, and we’re just going to learn more and more."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mean, one thing we’ll learn, I think, I hope we’ll learn in the next, in the near term is, once the Delta variant really does continue to decline, what’s going to happen to employment?"
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Are we going to start to see over the winter, you know, significant increases in jobs again?"
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"If you look back, the three-, six-, and nine-month average job creation is between 550,000 and 600,000."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,So if you think of that as a stronger—you don’t have to think back to the million-job months of June and July.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"You can just think, okay, 550 to 600—if we should get back on that path, then we would be making good progress, and we like to see that, of course."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,So we’ll know so much more.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, believe me, we understand."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s a different world in so many ways.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,And we’re very open to that.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you, Mr."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Chair, and thank you all for joining us today."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,So you ask about full employment.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, an economy where inflation was driven by services is now inflation where—all the inflation is in goods, which have had negative inflation for a quarter-century."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,All of this is completely unusual.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, real incomes were more than fully replaced by fiscal policy [support]."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"So that’s just, that’s a sign of a really strong labor market, as opposed to people just running off and quitting."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"There have also been—there are a significant number of retirements, and we’ll just have to see what that means."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, toward the end of the last cycle, which was the longest in our recorded economic history, we did see labor force participation moving up well above what economists estimate was the trend, and part of that was people staying in the labor force or just not retiring at the rates they were expected to retire."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,So maybe this was just catch-up on that.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"I am a believer that, over time, you won’t know how far—you won’t know what can happen with labor force participation in advance."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"You’re just going to have to give it some time, because we saw that over and over again."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"There are things that we can, where we can say, you know, this is where the limit is."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, again, I would just say, this system has been in place for decades."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Labor force participation is a much more flexible subject for me, and so I do think we need to be humble about what the limits are of labor force participation."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,We don’t know the pace at which it will do so.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"So in terms of full employment, as I discussed earlier, I think, at the very beginning of the recovery, the natural thing to do was to look back at labor conditions, labor market conditions in February of 2010, at the end of the longest expansion in our history."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"There was so much to like about that labor market, a really historically good labor market—never perfect, but a good labor market."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,We’re in a different world now.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,This is a—it’s just very different.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"The pandemic recession was the deepest, and the recovery has been the fastest."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,And wages didn’t really go down.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,But we expect labor force participation to pick up.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,You have more free cash flow.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,So there’s a lot of work to do to implement.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’re going to have to resource this much more significantly here at the Board, and also, we’re going to need appropriate technology, because, you know, the Fed has more than—the System has more than 30,000 employees."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, you know, this is—part of my job is—Congress has oversight over the Fed, and we take that very seriously."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"So if you’re on our, one of the two committees that has oversight over us, then I’m in regular contact with you, probably."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, when something like this comes up, I’m on the phone."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,I’m offering to meet with you and explain it to you and answer your questions and identify any concerns people might have.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s just part of my job.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,So I do that.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,I don’t talk about particular conversations.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,But you can assume I’ll always do that.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,And I certainly did it in this case.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,PAUL LAMONICA.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Let’s go to Hannah Lang at the American Banker.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,HANNAH LANG.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"I will say, though, that I have briefed Administration officials, and I’ve briefed people on Capitol Hill in detail about what we did and why we did it, and seeking their feedback, getting their reaction."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Hi.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,PAUL LAMONICA.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,So that was discussed long before anybody did it.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"That was—I think Milton Friedman said that that was what you could do if you were pinned at the lower bound, many, many years ago."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, anyway, that’s how it’s supposed to work."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, it’s quite hard to be precise about these things because, you know, you only have one economy, and you can’t run two different economies right next to each other and do a scientific experiment."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"But most people find—most of the findings are that it does support economic activity in the way that you would expect, which is to say, at the margin, more economic activity with lower rates, which is why we do what we do."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"More accommodative financial conditions lead to more economic activity, over time, with a lag."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,So I think that’s the main finding I would say on QE.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,We’re going to go to Paul Lamonica at CNN.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,PAUL LAMONICA.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Chair Powell, Chair Powell, you’ve addressed already questions about the stock purchases that took place from some of the regional Fed presidents and, you know, addressing the American people to make sure that they can trust the Fed."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"I was wondering, also, in light of the fact that, you know, we now have questions about your own future, whether or not President Biden will nominate you for a second term, what would you say—to the President and to senators that, potentially, you know, will be voting on a renomination—about this, specifically with regards to your future as Fed Chair for a possible second term?"
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I’m not going to—I won’t have any—I will answer your question, Paul, but I’m not going to have any comment whatsoever on the renomination process at all."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Fair enough.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,I wanted to ask about the supplementary leverage ratio.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Is the Fed still planning on taking comment on ways to permanently address that, and how concerned are you, ultimately, about banks’ willingness to intermediate in the Treasury markets without a permanent fix?"
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"And then, secondly, do you look back on the whole episode and have thoughts on your individual responsibility in preventing something like this from having happened?"
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"CHAIR POWELL You know, I think it’s too soon to say what the reputational damage is."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think, from the very beginning, my reaction was: We need to deal with this straightforwardly, transparently, and forcefully."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,And that’s what we’re going to do.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mean, it’s, it means everything to me that we do whatever it takes to make sure that nothing like this happens again, and I like to think we’ve made a real good start on that."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"If you think about it, you cannot execute a trade unless it’s precleared, and then you have to say, “Execute.” It’s not even a trade."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Really, there’s no trading going on."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"This is for investment and, you know, getting liquidity for life’s expenses."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,But you then have to wait 45 days to actually execute that sale or purchase.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,So I think it’s a pretty good system.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,We’ll always be looking to make it better.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"So in terms of our independence, you know, look, I think we will address this, and I think we have."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I like to think it’s enough, but it’s going to, you know—we’re just beginning to implement it."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"We have to write the rules, which we’re doing, you know, as quickly as possible."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,We need more people.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"You talked about what you’ve done already, but I’m just wondering if you can take a step back and just assess whether or not there was reputational damage as a result of that, either from the public’s view or from the financial community’s view of the Federal Reserve’s independence."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, just to expand on the ethics conversation, you talked about how you engage with people on Capitol Hill and in the Administration."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Brian Cheung, Yahoo Finance."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Chairman Powell."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,So I don’t have anything for you on supplemental leverage ratio right now.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"We are looking at ways to, if there are ways we can address liquidity issues through that channel."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’re also—we also have a—there’s a working group headed by [the] Treasury about, over Treasury [securities] markets, and what happened in the acute phase of the pandemic, and what structural things may need to be done."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"So that would be part of that workstream, and I know that there’s a lot going on."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,I’m not sure when that report will be out.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,So it’s work under way.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"That’s one of the many issues that are part of that, along with things like central clearing of Treasuries, greater central clearing, and, you know, many other ideas."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Not all of them, far few of them, will be covered by this, but the senior officers, who will be covered by this, will, you know, will have to have technology access, and it’s going to have to work efficiently."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s important that we have a liquid Treasury [securities] market.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,So we have to make sure that that’s always a first order of concern as well.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,HANNAH LANG.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Let’s go to Brian Cheung at Yahoo Finance.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,BRIAN CHEUNG.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s a huge public benefit that we do, and, you know, I think we need to do those things that enable that, you know, while also assuring the safety and soundness of our largest financial institutions, who tend to be the main dealers."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we need to be in a position to act in case it becomes necessary to do so or appropriate to do so, and we think we will be."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHAEL DERBY.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"And in this case, the risk is skewed."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Now, in real terms, they’ve been—they had been running a little bit below inflation, so real wages were not really increasing."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think, with the ECI reading, it becomes close to maybe not increasing, but close to back to zero in terms of the real increase."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"So wages moving up, of course, is how standard of living increases over the years for generation upon generation."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s very important, and it’s generally a good thing."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, the concern is a somewhat unusual case where, if wages were to be rising persistently and materially above inflation and productivity gains, that could put upward pressure on, or downward pressure on margins and cause companies to—or employers, really—to raise prices as a result, and you can see yourself, find yourself in what we used to call a wage–price spiral."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,We don’t have evidence of that yet.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Productivity has been very high.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,The ECI reading is just one reading.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Again, if you look back, we—so we’ll be watching this carefully."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"But I would say that, at this point, we don’t see troubling increases in wages."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we don’t expect those to emerge, but we’ll be watching carefully."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,JOE PAVEL.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Next, we’ll go to Steve Liesman from CNBC."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,STEVE LIESMAN.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, in particular, I would point to the employment compensation index reading that we got last Friday."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,I wonder if you could perhaps give us your thinking about the tradeoffs between inflation and unemployment.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"So wages have been moving up strongly, very strongly."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,I wonder if you see that as a positive thing or as a potential start to a wage–price spiral and sort of how you sort of delineate those two things.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, what I will tell you is, we will be watching carefully to see whether the economy evolves in line with our expectations, and policy will adapt appropriately."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,And that’s what I would say.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,NICK TIMIRAOS.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Based on—if I could follow up, based on your current outlook for the labor market, do you think it’s possible—or likely, even—that maximum employment could be achieved by the second half of next year?"
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"So if you look at the progress that we’ve made over the course of the last year, if that pace were to continue, then the answer would be: “Yes, I do think that that is possible.” Of course, we measure maximum employment based on a wide range of figures, but it’s certainly within the realm of possibility."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,NICK TIMIRAOS.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Next, we’ll go to Jeanna at the New York Times."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,JEANNA SMIALEK.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Chair Powell."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,I was wondering if you could detail a little bit how you’re thinking about wages at this moment.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Obviously, we’re seeing strong wage growth, particularly for people in sort of lower-income fields."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"You talked about the shortfall of unemployment—reemployment relative to before the pandemic, and yet you have inflation, which is affecting everybody."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Are we at, or close to, a point where the risk of inflation is greater than the benefit that you’d—for recovering these lost jobs so that now, from a risk- management standpoint, it makes sense to move more aggressively on rate hikes?"
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,And kind of a related question: The statement today says you’ll keep policy accommodative until you hit that 2 percent inflation target.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"We see shortages and bottlenecks persisting into next year, well into next year."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"We see higher inflation persisting, and we have to be in position to address that risk should it become really a threat to—should it create a threat of more persistent, longer-term inflation."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,And that’s what we think our policy is doing now.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s putting us in a position to be able to address the range of plausible outcomes.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,JOE PAVEL.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Next, we’ll go to Colby Smith at the Financial Times."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,COLBY SMITH.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Chair Powell, what are the economic conditions that would perhaps warrant a faster pace of tapering?"
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,And I’m wondering how you would also characterize the risks that the Fed may actually need to accelerate that process eventually.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I guess, as I said in my opening remarks, assuming the economy performs broadly as expected, the Committee judges that similar reductions in the pace of net asset purchases will likely be appropriate each month, and we’re prepared to deviate from that path if warranted by changes in the economic outlook."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,So I’m not going to give you a lot more detail on what that might be.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,We have to be aware of the risks that we’re—particularly now the risk of significantly higher inflation.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,And that is risk management.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,But what it really boils down to is something that’s common sense.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s very difficult.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Our surveys show looking for 5 percent inflation this year, 3½ percent next year—it sure seems like you’re on track to modestly or moderately exceed that 2 percent target."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Yes.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I’m not sure I totally got your first question, but I would say—in fact, could you just quickly, succinctly, say your first question again?"
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,STEVE LIESMAN.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Sure.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"If a response is called for, we will not hesitate."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"The idea that the tradeoff between inflation and unemployment, that you would keep policy accommodative to put this 5 million folks, or find these 5 million jobs again, at the same time all Americans will be suffering from higher inflation—is that tradeoff worth it, or is it better or smarter to raise rates right now to combat inflation and perhaps not lean so heavily on the employment side of the mandate?"
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Yes, so, you know, this isn’t the traditional Phillips curve situation where there’s a direct tradeoff, where that’s really what we’re talking about."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,The inflation that we’re seeing is really not due to a tight labor market.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s due to bottlenecks, and it’s due to shortages, and it’s due to very strong demand meeting those."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,So I think it’s not the classical situation where you have that precise tradeoff.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, you know, in this situation, we do have a provision in our Statement on Longer-Run Goals, as you know, that says when those two things are in tension, what we do is, we take into account the employment shortfalls and inflation deviations and the potentially different time horizons over which employment and inflation are projected to return to levels judged consistent with the mandate."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,So we used to call that the “balanced approach” paragraph.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"We have to think about the amount of the deviation, we have to think about the time it will take, and we have to make policy in a world where the two goals are in tension."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Of course, if we do see something like that happening, if it becomes a question, then we’ll communicate very transparently and openly about that."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,We think we can be patient.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, certainly, we should see inflation moving down by the second or third quarter."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"This figure understates the shortfall in employment, particularly as participation in the labor market remains subdued."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Some of the softness in participation likely reflects the aging of the population and retirements.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"But participation for prime-aged individuals also remains well below pre-pandemic levels—in part reflecting factors related to the pandemic, such as caregiving needs and ongoing concerns about the virus."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"As a result, employers are having difficulties filling job openings."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,These impediments to labor supply should diminish with further progress on containing the virus—supporting gains in employment and economic activity.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"The economic downturn has not fallen equally on all Americans, and those least able to shoulder the burden have been hardest hit."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Despite progress, joblessness continues to fall disproportionately on African Americans and Hispanics."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,The supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic and the reopening of the economy have contributed to sizable price increases in some sectors.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"In particular, bottlenecks and supply chain disruptions are limiting how quickly production can respond to the rebound in demand in the near term."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"As a result, overall inflation is running well above our 2 percent longer-run goal."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Supply constraints have been larger and longer lasting than anticipated.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Nonetheless, it remains the case that the drivers of higher inflation have been predominantly connected to the dislocations caused by the pandemic—specifically, the effects on supply and demand from the shutdown, the uneven reopening, and the ongoing effects of the virus itself."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"We understand the difficulties that high inflation poses for individuals and families, particularly those with limited means to absorb higher prices for essentials such as food and transportation."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Our tools cannot ease supply constraints.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Like most forecasters, we continue to believe that our dynamic economy will adjust to the supply and demand imbalances and that, as it does, inflation will decline to levels much closer to our 2 percent longer-run goal."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,The unemployment rate was 4.8 percent in September.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Of course, it is very difficult to predict the persistence of supply constraints or their effects on inflation."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"The slowdown has been concentrated in sectors most sensitive to the pandemic, including leisure and hospitality and education."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"As with overall economic activity, the pace of improvement slowed with the rise in COVID cases."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Transcript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference November 3, 2021 CHAIR POWELL."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Good afternoon.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"At the Federal Reserve, we are strongly committed to achieving the monetary policy goals that Congress has given us: maximum employment and price stability."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Today, the FOMC kept interest rates near zero and, in light of the progress the economy has made toward our goals, decided to begin reducing the pace of asset purchases."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"With these actions, monetary policy will continue to provide strong support to the economic recovery."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Given the unprecedented nature of the disruptions related to the pandemic and the reopening of the economy, we remain attentive to risks and will ensure that our policy is well positioned to address the full range of plausible economic outcomes."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,I will say more about our monetary policy decisions after reviewing recent economic developments.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Economic activity expanded at a 6.5 percent pace in the first half of the year, reflecting progress on vaccinations, the reopening of the economy, and strong policy support."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"In the third quarter, real GDP growth slowed notably from this rapid pace."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"The summer’s surge in COVID cases from the Delta variant has held back the recovery in the sectors most adversely affected by the pandemic, including travel and leisure."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Activity has also been restrained by supply constraints and bottlenecks, notably in the motor vehicle industry."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"As a result, both household spending and business investment flattened out last quarter."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Nonetheless, aggregate demand has been very strong this year, buoyed by fiscal and monetary policy support and the healthy financial positions of households and businesses."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"With COVID case counts receding further and progress on vaccinations, economic growth should pick up this quarter, resulting in strong growth for the year as a whole."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Conditions in the labor market have continued to improve, and demand for workers remains very strong."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"In August and September, job gains averaged 280,000 per month, down from an average of about 1 million jobs per month in June and July."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Global supply chains are complex; they will return to normal function, but the timing of that is highly uncertain."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,We are committed to our longer-run goal of 2 percent inflation and to having longer-term inflation expectations well anchored at this goal.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"If we were to see signs that the path of inflation, or [of] longer-term inflation expectations, was moving materially and persistently beyond levels consistent with our goal, we would use our tools to preserve price stability."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,We’ll go to Nick at the Wall Street Journal.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,NICK TIMIRAOS.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Hi.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Chair Powell, the markets anticipate you will raise rates once or twice next year."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Are they wrong?
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,So I would say it this way.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"We try to focus on what we can control—and that is how to communicate as clearly as possible, in this highly uncertain world, how we’re thinking about the economic outlook and the balance of risks and how policy will evolve in that case and also in the cases, which are frequent, where the economy evolves in unexpected ways."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"So the focus at this meeting is on tapering asset purchases, not on raising rates."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"It is time to taper, we think, because the economy has achieved substantial further progress toward our goals, measured from last December."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,We don’t think it’s time yet to raise interest rates.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"There is still ground to cover to reach maximum employment, both in terms of employment and in terms of participation."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Getting to your question, our baseline expectation is that supply bottlenecks and shortages will persist well into next year, and elevated inflation as well, and that, as the pandemic subsides, supply chain bottlenecks will abate—and job growth will move back up."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"And as that happens, inflation will decline from today’s elevated levels."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,I look forward to your questions.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,We will be watching carefully to see whether the economy is evolving in line with expectations.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"The Fed’s policy actions have been guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people, along with our responsibilities to promote the stability of the financial system."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Our asset purchases have been a critical tool.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,They helped preserve financial stability early in the pandemic and since then have helped foster smooth market functioning and accommodative financial conditions to support the economy.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Last December, the Committee stated its intention to continue asset purchases at a pace of at least $120 billion per month until substantial further progress has been made toward our maximum-employment and price-stability goals."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"At today’s meeting, the Committee judged that the economy has met this test, and decided to begin reducing the pace of its asset purchases."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Beginning later this month, we will reduce the monthly pace of our net asset purchases by $10 billion for Treasury securities and $5 billion for agency mortgage-backed securities."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,The time for lifting rates and beginning to remove accommodation will depend on the path of the economy.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"We also announced another reduction of this size in the monthly purchase pace starting in mid- December, since that month’s purchase schedule will be released by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York prior to our December FOMC meeting."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"That said, we are prepared to adjust the pace of purchases if warranted by changes in the economic outlook."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"And even after our balance sheet stops expanding, our holdings of securities will continue to support accommodative financial conditions."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Our decision today to begin tapering our asset purchases does not imply any direct signal regarding our interest rate policy.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,We continue to articulate a different and more stringent test for the economic conditions that would need to be met before raising the federal funds rate.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"To conclude, we understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Everything we do is in service to our public mission.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,We at the Fed will do everything we can to complete the recovery in employment and achieve our price-stability goal.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"If the economy evolves broadly as expected, we judge that similar reductions in the pace of net asset purchases will likely be appropriate each month, implying that increases in our securities holdings would cease by the middle of next year."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,But I’m just going to leave it with the words that are in the statement.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Of course, the timing of that is highly uncertain."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,COLBY SMITH.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s a decision for the Committee.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,I would put it to you this way.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"When we reach maximum employment, when we reach a state where labor market conditions are at maximum employment in the Committee’s judgment, it’s very possible that the inflation test will already be met."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’re aware that that language sounds, it sounds a little out of touch with what’s going on, but, you know, we’re not at maximum employment."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"When that is the case, we’ll look to see whether the inflation test is met, and there’s a good chance that it will be if you look at how inflation has evolved in the last year and a half."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,HOWARD SCHNEIDER.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, to follow up, so you’re not willing to commit that the current levels of inflation and their persistence have met “moderately” and “for some time.” So, given that, I mean, how should we wonder what “moderately” over and “for some time” mean?"
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"What I’m really saying is, that question is not before us right now."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, we had the question on when to taper."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,We’ve now answered that question and the speed of it and all that.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"We have not focused on whether we meet the liftoff test, because we don’t meet the liftoff test now because we’re not at maximum employment."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"What I’m saying is, given where inflation is and where it’s projected to be, let’s say we do meet the maximum-employment test."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Then the Committee—the question for the Committee at that time will be, has the inflation test been met?"
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, I don’t want to get ahead of the Committee on that, but the answer may very well be “Yes, it’s been met.” But we’re not asking that question today, because we’re not running a liftoff test."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,We’re not evaluating the liftoff test today.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Has the economy cleared that?
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,HOWARD SCHNEIDER.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I think there’s room for a whole lot of humility here, as we try to think about what maximum employment would be."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’re going to have to see some time post-COVID so that we know—or post-Delta, anyway—to see what is possible."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I think the learning for those of us who lived through the last cycle is that, over time, you can get to places that didn’t look possible."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Now, what we also have now, though, is, we have high inflation."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we have a completely different situation now where we have high inflation, and we have to balance that with what’s going on in the employment market."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"So it’s a complicated situation, and I would say, we will, we hope to achieve significantly greater clarity about where this economy is going and what the characteristics of the post-pandemic economy are over the first half of next year."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,JOE PAVEL.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,We’ll go to Howard Schneider at Reuters.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,HOWARD SCHNEIDER.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thanks, and thanks for doing this."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, given that answer about employment, I would like to get back to Steve’s question a little bit."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"On a headline basis, just as it’s evolved this year, do you feel that the two tests on inflation have been met?"
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Sorry, the two tests?"
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,The two tests in the statement—the guidance that it has to hit 2 percent and be on track to moderately be above 2 percent.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"We did talk about the economy and the development of the economy, but we didn’t ask ourselves whether the liftoff test is met, because, you know, it’s clearly not met on the maximum-employment side."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,HOWARD SCHNEIDER.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Many of them are signaling a tight labor market, but the issue is, how persistent is that?"
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Because you have people who are held out of the labor market, you know, of their own—they’re holding themselves out of the labor market because of caretaking needs or because of fear of COVID, or, for whatever reason, they’re staying out."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"And it’s clear that there are, you know—with tremendous demand for workers and wages moving up, it does seem like we’re set up to go back to a higher job- creation rate."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,So that would suggest that you’re not at maximum employment.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, at the end of the day, it is a judgment thing."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, of course, at the end of it, it also has to be a level of employment that’s consistent with price stability."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,MATTHEW BOESLER.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"And if I could just follow up briefly, you know, you’ve talked a little bit about this possibility that the two goals might be in tension and how you would have to balance those two things."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Could you talk a little bit about what the Fed’s process for balancing those two goals would be in the event that, say, come next year, you decide there’s a serious risk of persistent inflationary pressures despite ongoing employment shortfalls?"
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Yes.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mean, again, it’s a risk-management thing."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s not—I can’t reduce it to an equation, but, ultimately, it’s about risk management."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"So you want to be in a position to act, to cover the full range of plausible outcomes, not just the base case."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Sorry, was there a second part?"
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,I mentioned quits and job openings and wages and things.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"So the thing is, by many measures, we are at a very tight labor market."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,So we look at a range of things.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"And so you wouldn’t really be at maximum employment, because there’s this group that isn’t counted as unemployed."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Let’s go to Matthew Boesler at Bloomberg.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,MATTHEW BOESLER.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Chair Powell."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Matthew Boesler with Bloomberg.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, when you’re looking at this question of assessing whether or not the U.S. economy is at maximum employment, do you have a framework for making that judgment that is independent of what inflation is doing?"
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"That doesn’t seem to have been the case, interestingly."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, if not, does it kind of complicate that assessment, given all of the uncertainty about inflation right now and the inclination to believe that, you know, the high inflation we’re seeing is not related to capacity utilization in the labor market?"
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we don’t actually define maximum employment as—we define it in terms of inflation, but, of course, there is a connection there."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Maximum employment has to be a level that is consistent with stable prices.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,But that’s not really how we think about it.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,We think about maximum employment as looking at a broad range of things.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"You can’t just look at— unlike inflation, where you can have a number."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"But with maximum employment, you could be in a situation, hypothetically, where the unemployment rate is low, but there are many people who are out of the labor force and will come back in."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, we thought that schools reopening and elapsing unemployment benefits would produce some sort of additional labor supply."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,We didn’t have that discussion at today’s meeting.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"We would see whether—how does participation react in that world, in that sort of post-COVID world?"
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"What is your message to those families or consumers that are struggling with higher prices right now, and do you feel that your expectations around transitory inflation, that message is reaching them?"
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"For now, it appears to be skewed toward higher inflation."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Yes.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, first of all, it is our job to—and we accept responsibility and accountability for inflation in the medium term."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,We’re accountable to Congress and to the American people for maximum employment and price stability.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,The level of inflation we have right now is not at all consistent with price stability.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"You mentioned at the beginning that the Fed understands the difficulties that high inflation poses for individuals and families, especially those with limited means."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"By the way, we’re also not at maximum employment, as I mentioned."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"We don’t think it’s a good time to raise interest rates, though, because we want to see the labor market heal further."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we have very good reason to think that that will happen as the Delta variant declines, so—which it’s doing now."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,So “transitory” is a word that people have had different understandings of.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"For some, it carries a sense of “short lived,” and that’s, you know, there’s a real time component—measured in months, let’s say."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Really, for us, what “transitory” has meant is that if something is transitory, it will not leave behind it permanently or very persistently higher inflation."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"So that’s why we, you know, we took a step back from “transitory.” We said “expected to be transitory,” first of all, to show uncertainty around that—we’ve always said that, by the way, in other contexts; we just hadn’t done it in the statement—but also to acknowledge, really, that it means different things to different people."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,And then we added some language to really explain more what we’re talking about in paragraph two and paragraph three.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,So I would want to assure people that we will use our tools as appropriate to get inflation under control.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"We said that “supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic and the reopening of the economy have contributed to sizable price increases,” and we said, “Progress on vaccinations and an easing of supply constraints are expected to support continued gains in economic activity and employment as well as a reduction in inflation.” So we’re trying to explain what we mean and also acknowledging more uncertainty about “transitory.” So it’s, I mean, it’s become a word that’s attracted a lot of attention that maybe is distracting from our message, which we want to be as clear as possible."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you so much for taking our questions.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,RACHEL SIEGEL.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Yes.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Right now, people are staying out of the labor market because of caretaking [and] because of fear of COVID to a significant extent."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s just on characterizing the risks that you might actually have to do so later on.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, I would just leave you with the words we have here."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,We are prepared to speed up or slow down the pace of reductions in asset purchases if it’s warranted by changes in the economic outlook.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, again, if we feel like something like that’s happening, then we’ll be very transparent about it."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Chair Powell."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,We wouldn’t want to surprise markets.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"But so—but I’m not going to, you know, start making up examples of what that might be today."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,COLBY SMITH.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,JOE PAVEL.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Next one, Rachel Siegel at the Washington Post."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’ll say, in light of this factor or these factors, we are considering doing this, and then we would either do it or not do it."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Ultimately, the only other thing I would say is, look, we understand completely that it’s particularly people who are living paycheck to paycheck or seeing higher grocery costs, higher gasoline costs—when the winter comes, higher heating costs for their homes."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,We understand completely what they’re going through.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"So maximum employment is, it’s a broad—what would we say?—broad-based and inclusive goal that’s not directly measurable and changes over time due to various factors."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,You can’t specify a specific goal.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"So it’s taking into account quite a broad range of things, and, of course, employment—levels of employment—[and] participation are a part of that."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we look at so many different things, and you make an overall judgment."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Now, the temptation at the beginning of the recovery was to look at the data in February of 2020 and say, well, that’s the goal because we didn’t know any—that’s what we knew."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,We knew that was achievable in a context of low inflation.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think we’re in a, you know, we’re learning that."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"We have to be humble about what we know about this economy, which is still very, you know, COVID-affected, by the way."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,A lot of what we’re seeing in the last 90 days is because of Delta.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,We were on a path to a very different place.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Delta put us on a different path.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,And we see these things.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, so I think we’re going to have to—ideally, we would have, we would see further development of the labor market in a context where there isn’t another COVID spike, and then we would be able to see, I think, a lot."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Will you be looking at prime-age employment population ratio, for example, and, if so, do you need to see it get back to pre-COVID levels to achieve maximum employment, or is there something short of that that would work?"
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, in addition, there are other measures of what’s going on in the labor market, like wages is a key measure of how tight the labor market is—the level of quits, the amount of job openings, the flows in and out of various states."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,You did mention the prime-age folks.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, we will use our tools over time to make sure that that doesn’t become a permanent feature of life."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"So can you give us some examples of things you're looking at, specifically, to measure full employment?"
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Really, that’s one of our principal jobs, along with achieving maximum employment."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,And that’s our commitment.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,CHRIS RUGABER.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Great.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,We’ll go to Chris Rugaber of the Associated Press.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you, Chair Powell."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Well, I wonder if you could update us."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"You talked about getting back to full employment, and so could you update how you define that?"
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mean, you’ve, you know—a few months ago, yourself and other Fed officials talked about getting back to the pre-COVID labor market."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,There were even hints you might try to do something better than that.
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Now we heard talk of, as you mentioned, people retiring, and there’s talk of not being able to get back as—all the jobs back because of that and other trends."
2021-11-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you, Michelle."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, it’s, it’s based on both of those things, I suppose."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, that’s the most likely case."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"I do think there’s a broad expectation among forecasters, including our own, that the bottlenecks will alleviate sometime over the course of this year."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"If you look at where Blue Chip forecasts are—which is, you know, a group of well-resourced, large forecasting operations with a long track record—they’ll show inflation coming back down significantly toward the back-end of next year."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"So that’s a significant—you know, in an SEP, that’s a pretty significant move up."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"I would say, though, as well that our policy should begin to have an effect."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"There will be a lag, but it should begin to have an effect on that as well."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"I guess what—the thing I would want to say, though, is we can’t act as though that’s a certainty, and we’re not going to act as though that’s a certainty."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,We need to see more data.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s certainly increased.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"I don’t think it’s high at this moment, but I think it’s increased."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,And I think that’s part of the reason behind our move today.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,[It] is to put ourselves in a position to be able to deal with that risk.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,And I think we are in a position to deal with that risk.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, actually, I’m looking at the SEP here, and the median forecasts for core and headline inflation did move up by 4/10 each."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"We need to see how the inflation data and the—all the data evolve in coming months, but we are prepared to, you know, to use our tools to make sure that higher inflation doesn’t get entrenched."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"There’s a real risk now, we believe, I believe, that inflation may be more persistent and that may be putting inflation expectations under pressure, and that the risk of higher inflation becoming entrenched has increased."

2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"In other words, is it a question of when, not if, you raise interest rates?"
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"For one reason, as I—as I just mentioned, it’s one of the two big threats, the other being the pandemic itself, to getting back to maximum employment."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"How concerned or what is your level of concern the consumer may be turning away from this economy or pulling back because of inflation, the virus, or something else?"
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,We see consumer expense as very strong in this quarter.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"I don’t know, Edward, whether you’re talking about more shopping online versus shopping in the store, but consumer demand is very strong, incomes are very strong, you know, because people are going back to work and they’re getting wage increases."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"Admittedly, some of the wage increases is being eaten away by inflation."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, nonetheless, incomes, overall, are going up really significantly because of increased employment and spending is—has been strong."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,And does it suggest that maybe your critics are correct and you might be afraid you’re “behind the curve”?
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,There may be something in the seasonality that this year’s holiday spending may have been pulled forward.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"But fundamentally, though, the consumer is really healthy, and we expect personal consumption expenditures to be pretty strong in the fourth quarter."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"Okay, let’s go to Mike at Bloomberg."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHAEL MCKEE.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"Mr. Chairman, the median forecast for inflation in this month’s or this meeting’s economic projections has been revised up significantly for 2021 but barely moved for 2022 and 2023."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,You’ve said you expect inflation to fall significantly.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,Is that because you’re going to raise interest rates or because the virus is going to fade and the effects are going to fade?
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, of course, there may be effects from, from Delta and there might be going forward from Omicron."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, right now, they aren’t."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHAEL DERBY.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"We don’t have any basis for thinking that the new variant that we have is that one, but it’s certainly one we’re looking at."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"I would say, you know, cyber risk, the risk of a successful cyberattack, is, for me, you know, always the most—you know, one that would be very difficult to deal with."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,I think we know how to deal with bad loans and things like that.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,I think more—a cyberattack that were to take down a major financial institution or financial market utility would be a really significant financial stability risk that we haven’t actually faced yet.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I could go on with a list of “horribles,” but I think that’s a decent picture of where I would start."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHAEL DERBY.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,How about the cryptocurrency issues?
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,We don’t see that.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"Anything that worries you there that’s going on in there in terms of—you know, obviously a lot’s happening in that sector."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, I think the concerns there are not so much current financial-stability concerns."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"I, of course, would support the, the views expressed in the President’s Working Group report on stablecoins."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"Stablecoins can certainly be a useful, efficient, consumer-serving, part of the financial system, if they’re properly regulated."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, and they have the potential to scale [up], particularly if they were to be, you know, associated with one of the very large tech networks that exist and you could have a payment network that was immediately systemically important—close to immediately systemically important that didn’t have appropriate regulation and protections."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"You see electronic sales down 4.6 percent month over month, also department store sales down 5.4 percent month over month."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"The public relies on the government—and [on] the Fed, in particular—to make sure that the payment system is safe and reliable, as well as the dollar and—you know, to provide a safe and reliable trusted currency."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,Does that concern you at all?
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s, it’s the emergence of a new variant that could, you know, that could lead to significant economic—if there were to be a variant, for example, [and if] that were quite resistant to vaccines, it could have another significant effect on the economy."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"In terms of the things, you know, that we’re—that we’re looking for, looking at, you know, it’s the—it’s the things we’ve already talked about, to some extent."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, overall, you know, financial stability, that’s how—I wouldn’t make an overall characteristic, but we break it down into those pieces."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,Yeah.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks for taking my question.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"So as the Fed shifts towards an accelerated taper, I wonder what your read is on financial-stability risks right now."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mean, these periods can be—you know, it seems like the taper process has gone fairly smooth so far."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, you know, what do you see in terms of stability risks?"
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,Are there any parts of the financial sector that concern you right now?
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"And are there any significant systemic issues that are on your radar, you know, maybe from the cryptocurrency sector or something like that?"
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, we have—we have had now for a decade and more a four-part financial stability framework that we use so we can—we can hold ourselves to the same kind of framework and, you know, not just treat each event individually."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"And there are four key areas: asset valuations, debt owed by households and businesses, funding risk, and leverage among financial institutions."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I would say asset valuations—I’m going to go really superficially here, but asset valuations are somewhat elevated, I would say."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"Debt owed by businesses, you know, and households—households are in very strong financial shape."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"Businesses actually have a lot of debt, but their default rates are very, very low."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, nonetheless, it’s something we’re watching."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"Funding risk is, by and large, low among, among financial institutions."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"But we do see money market funds as a vulnerability and, and, you know, would applaud the SEC’s action this week."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"Leverage among financial institutions is low, in the sense that [their] capital is high."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,Let’s go to Michael Derby at the Wall Street Journal.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"And what you’re seeing is fewer people spending at restaurants and drinking places, more people spending at grocery stores."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"And so that’s, that’s how we think about it."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thanks, Michelle, and thanks for taking the question, Chair Powell."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"Good afternoon, Chair Powell, and thank you for taking our questions."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,I wanted to follow up on some of your earlier comments about labor force participation.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I wondered, what do you think needs to change in the economy to kind of get a meaningful recovery in labor force participation, and also whether running the economy hot, like in the last expansion, is one way of doing that?"
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"Well, the labor market is, by so many measures, hotter than it ever ran in the last—in the last expansion, if you think about it."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, the ratio of job openings, for example, to, to vacancies is at all-time highs."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,OLIVIA ROCKEMAN.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"Quits, the wages—all those things are, are even hotter."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, that’s—really, “Why is it low?” is the question."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"So there, there are a bunch of answers, and all of them probably have some, you know, some validity."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"Part of it will be that people—for certain people, they don’t want to go back in the labor force because either they’re medically vulnerable or they’re not comfortable going back while COVID is still everywhere."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s one thing.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"The lack of availability of childcare made for caretakers is certainly part of it—not just for children, but for older people."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"It has been pointed out by many that the stock market is high, people’s portfolios are stronger—they may go back to being a one-income rather than a two-income family."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,The same thing with people’s houses.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,But what would it take for labor force participation to move up more?
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,We’ll go to Olivia from Bloomberg.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,So—but I do think those are longer term.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"The quits rate is really one of the very best indicators, according to a lot of labor economists, because people quit because they feel like they can get a better job."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"And there’s, you know, record amounts, historically high levels of that going on—suggesting, again, that you’ve got a very tight labor market."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"So on wages, that’s the price indicator we look at to tell us, along with all the other data, whether we’re—whether we have labor market conditions that are consistent with maximum employment."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"But the—one of the complications is that, again, we’ve got to make policy in real time."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,So how do we think about that?
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"Do we—if we think we can make labor, you know, participation might move up—if we, let’s say we knew that it would start to move up in two years, would we wait two years when inflation is running way above target?"
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"Probably not, you know, so you have to make an assessment that what’s max—what is the level of maximum employment that is consistent with price stability in real time is, is one way to think about it."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,VICTORIA GUIDA.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"Just to kind of follow up on that for a second, if you do raise interest rates next year and, you know, it’s—you’re not certain whether you’re at maximum employment, are you all going to point—when you raise interest rates, are you going to point to ways in which the labor market could still improve?"
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,Yes.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mean, I—absolutely."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"I, I think—well, whether or not we— whether or not we say “we’re at conditions—labor market conditions consistent with, with maximum employment” next year, we would all be open and I think expect, over time, that the level of maximum employment that’s consistent with price stability would increase further over time—for example, through increasing participation."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I—we would certainly—we would not, in any way, want to foreclose the idea that the labor market can get even better."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, again, with inflation as high as it is, we have to make policy in real time."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,We’ve got to make that assessment in real time.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"People buy—they have a mortgage, you know, with leverage, and the house price increases, the equity they have in their home might have doubled."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,So I was looking at the consensus data for estimated monthly changes on sales.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,And they might make—reach the same conclusion.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, for all of those reasons—and it’s hard to know exactly the part each of them plays— we, we have a situation where we’ve had a shock to labor force participation that is not unwinding as quickly as, as many, as expected."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, I mean, I—What we can do is try to create the conditions."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"There’s a lot of good for society when you have a tight but stable labor market, where people are coming in, they’re getting into the labor force, they’re getting paid well."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"In the labor market we had before, we had, you know—the biggest wage increases were going to people at the bottom end of the wage spectrum for the last couple of years."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,There were just a lot of really desirable aspects of a labor market like that.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,Higher participation is one of them.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,And we’d love to get back there.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, again, ultimately, we have the tools that we have, which are essentially to stimulate demand and also to control inflation."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"The question of how much we can get back up closer to where we were in February of 2020—and, indeed, for the year or so before that—is a good one."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mean, really, it might be—one of the two big threats to getting back to maximum employment is actually high inflation, because, to get back to where we were, the evidence grows that it’s going to take some time."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"Over the last 40 years, we’ve had, I think, three of the four longest in our recorded history, including the last one, which was the longest in our recorded history."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s what it would really take to get back to the kind of labor market we’d like to see.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"And to have that happen, we need to make sure that we maintain price stability."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"Okay, let’s go to Edward Lawrence at Fox."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,EDWARD LAWRENCE.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"And what we need is another long expansion, like the ones we’ve been having."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"So you would expect that, that the trend would be lower and that, over time, participation would move down."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"But—so one would expect over time that labor force participation would, would move down because an aging population, the older people are, the lower their participation rate is."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,And we actually got above the demographic trend at the end of the last expansion.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"And people—in effect, a good part of it is voluntary."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, people—and this is how they want to maximize their welfare and that’s, that’s their, certainly their choice."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"In other cases, it’s something that will abate very quickly if and when the pandemic gets under control."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"And the longer the pandemic goes on, you know, maybe the less likely that people will come back because they’re—you know, they get used to their new life and they lose contact with their old jobs."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"That’s, that’s what the evidence would say."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,So it’s a range of things.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,It isn’t that the economy lacks stimulus.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, usually, in every other expansion, it’s that there aren’t enough jobs and people can’t find jobs and, you know, we’re stimulating demand and trying to get demand to come up."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s not the problem here.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"The problem is a supply-side problem, which—what it would take to work it out, I think it’s going to be time."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"And the number-one thing would, would really be to have the pandemic get under control."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s what everyone would really like to see: What does the labor force— what does the labor market look like in a world without COVID?
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"That would be the thing that we’d really like to see but, you know, it doesn’t look like that’s coming anytime soon."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,OLIVIA ROCKEMAN.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"And just to quickly follow up on that: If some of the reason that labor force participation isn’t back to, you know, February 2020 levels is because people are voluntarily making life decisions that are different, does that make you think we’re going to end up at a lower rate overall?"
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"Well, there’s a demographic trend underlying all of this."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"So they’re—and people have savings on their balance sheet because of forced savings because they couldn’t spend on travel and things like that and also because of, you know, because of government transfers."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"In terms of, you know, the more—the cryptocurrencies, you know, that are really speculative assets, I don’t see them as a financial-stability concern at the moment."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I think, very important, that we stay out of that business, no matter who’s in the White House, who’s in Congress."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"And there’s certainly developments in the—in the markets that are worth following, which are really not in our jurisdiction, but things like, you know, the kind of leverage that’s built into and those sorts of things is certainly worth, worth watching."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,And the place I would start is just look at global sovereign yields around the world.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"Look at JGBs, look at bunds, and they’re so much lower."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"You can get—you can get, you know, a much higher yield on U.S. Treasuries by buying USTs rather than bunds and you can—you can hedge, hedge the currency risk back into yen, back into euros and still be way ahead."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, in a way, it’s not surprising that there’s a lot of demand for, for U.S. sovereigns in a world—you know, in a risk-free world where, where there’s so much—they’re yielding so much more than bunds are, than JGBs."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"So that’s, that’s a big part of it."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"I also think, you know, there, there may be some assessment in there of what the neutral rate is or what the terminal rate is."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,I don’t know about that.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think a lot of things go into the, you know, the long rates."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"But—and I would just say that we, you know, we write down our own estimates of the—of the terminal rate or the neutral rate of interest."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, we’ll make policy based on what we’re seeing in the economy rather than based on what a neutral—what a model might say the neutral rate is."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"We, we all had the experience of the last cycle, where we all, through that cycle, were trying to estimate what the neutral rate was, and it turned out—you know, I think we learned a lot from seeing what happens."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,We ended up cutting rates three times after raising them to 2¼ to 2½ percent.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,So I’m not troubled by where the long bond [rate] is.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, I see that it’s low."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, I mean, we’re really focused on broader financial conditions, [and] we’re focused on maximum employment and price stability."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,Those are highly uncertain.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I, I think the short-end actions are easy to understand, which is, you know, they’re basically very [monetary] policy-sensitive rates at the short end, and it makes sense that it’s reacting to changes in expectations for policy."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,What are you gleaning from the bond market actions over the last six weeks?
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"It had nothing—so far, this inflation has really nothing to do with tightness in the labor market."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"It does have to do with, with strong demand, and strong demand was supported by the Fed, it was supported by Congress."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"I’m not making any judgments on Congress, it’s not my job."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"But I will just say, we’re coming out of a, you know, what we certainly hope will be a once in a lifetime, certainly historic—the first really global modern pandemic—which looked at the beginning like it might cause a global depression."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, so we threw a lot of support at it [the economy]."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"And what’s coming out now is, is, you know, really strong growth, really strong demand, high incomes, and all that kind of thing."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, people will judge in 25 years whether we—whether we overdid it or not, but, you know, the reality is, we are where we are."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, we think our policy is, is the right one for the situation that we’re in."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,Let’s go to Brian Cheung.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,BRIAN CHEUNG.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Chairman Powell."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,Wanted to ask about the bond markets.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"When you see the 10-year at 146 basis points, do you have any sort of concerns about an environment by which you might be hiking interest rates into?"
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,Would you prefer the curve be a little bit steeper?
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"For the last question, we’ll go to Greg Robb."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,GREG ROBB.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you very much.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"I guess that some people are saying that it was the, you know, the stimulus in March that was sort of over—we didn’t really need all that stimulus, and that there was talk even then that that would be a mistake and it would lead to higher inflation."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,And perhaps that you didn’t push back as much as you might have otherwise.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,I didn’t push back at all.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"And the reason I didn’t—and there was no—there was lots of talk about that, but not from the Fed, because that is not our job."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"We are not the CBO, and we’re not elected by anybody."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we take fiscal policy as it arrives at our front door, and we don’t comment—you know, we make our own assessments inside the Fed, but it’s really not our role."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,Just a quick follow-up.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,The quits rate is another one.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,GREG ROBB.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you, Mr."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,Chair.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you, everyone."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s just—it’s just not our job and it’s something we avoid pretty, pretty assiduously."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,GREG ROBB.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’re always going to just do what we think is the right thing, and I certainly will always just do what I think the right thing is for the economy and for the people that we serve."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,And it had absolutely nothing to do with it whatsoever.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"Chair Powell, I was wondering if—I wanted to give you the opportunity to talk about something that I’ve heard that’s been discussed—that, you know, your pivot towards a tighter policy, hawkish policy stance had something to do with the timing of your renomination by the President."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"Sure, I’d be happy to talk about that."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, as I mentioned, we got the ECI reading just before the November meeting."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,We got the labor market report two days after the meeting.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"And then, one week after that, I think on the 12th of November, we got the CPI reading."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"It was really the CPI reading, in concert with those two, and I, I just came to the view over that weekend that we needed to speed up the taper."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,And we started working on that.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,That's a full 10 days or so before the President made a decision of renominating me.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, honestly, it had—it had nothing to do with that at all."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,And I just thought this is what we got to do.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,My colleagues were out talking about the—a faster taper.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,And that doesn’t happen by accident.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,They were out talking about a faster taper before the President made his decision.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"So it’s a decision that effectively was in—more than in train and, you know, to the point where people were talking about it publicly."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,So that’s what happened.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"Or, you know, it has been the opposite, where we have very high inflation and we’ve had it since the labor market was in terrible shape."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,This is literally the opposite.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, that’s a situation where you had a very, very high level of employment and low inflation."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,This is something completely different.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,Let’s go to Evan at Market News.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,EVAN RYSER.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Chair Powell."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,I was wondering if we should still be seeing the taper and interest rate hikes as separate.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, secondly, in the last cycle, the Fed started shrinking the balance sheet when short-term interest rates were about 1 to 1¼ percent range."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I wouldn’t look at it that we’re “behind the curve.” I would look at it that we’re actually in position now to take the steps that we’ll need to take, you know, in a thoughtful manner to address all of the issues, including that of, of too-high inflation."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,Do you think the FOMC might be able to potentially start running off assets before that this time?
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,Are they separate?
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"So our interest rate—I mean, they are separate tools."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"So the—you know, the, the asset purchases are a separate tool from interest rates."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,Stopping asset purchases does not remove accommodation.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,It just stops adding further accommodation.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,Whereas raising interest rates starts to remove accommodation from what is a highly accommodative stance.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, the extent to which they’ll be separated in time is, is something we haven’t really discussed at the Committee [meetings] yet."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,And we’ll continue to adapt our policy.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,And I think we’re reacting to that now.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,I think that the data that we got toward the end of the fall was a—was a really strong signal that inflation is more persistent and higher—and that the risk of it remaining higher for longer has grown.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,Let’s go to Nancy Marshall-Genzer at Marketplace.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,Chair Powell.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Chair Powell, thanks for the question."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"Going back to inflation, is the Fed “behind the curve” on getting inflation under control?"
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,So I would say this.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"I actually think we are well positioned to deal with, with what’s coming, with the range of plausible outcomes that can come."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,I do.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I think if you look at how we got here, I do think we’ve, we’ve been adapting to the incoming data, really all the way along, and, you know, noticing and calling out that, that the—both the effects and the persistence of inflation of bottlenecks and labor shortages and things like that."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we’ve been calling out the fact that those were becoming longer, and more persistent, and larger."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"And now we’re in a position where we’re ending our taper within the next—well, by March, in two meetings, and we’ll be in a position to raise interest rates as and when we think it’s appropriate."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we will, if that—to the extent that’s appropriate."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"At the same time, we’re going to be seeing a few more months of data."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,I don’t actually think we’re out of position now.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,I think this was an important move for us to make.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"We will be discussing that, obviously, in coming meetings."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"I do think they are risky, they’re not backed by anything, and I think there’s big consumer—issues for consumers who may or may not understand what they’re getting."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"I don’t think that, that—the last cycle, there was quite a long separation before interest rates."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’re in a very, very different place with high inflation, strong growth, a really strong economy."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,We’ll go to Scott Horsley at NPR.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,SCOTT HORSLEY.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thanks, Mr. Chairman."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,I think you said a few minutes ago that the inflation that we got during the pandemic was not the inflation that we—that you anticipated when you crafted the framework.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,And you described it as a collision of a lot of monetary and fiscal stimulus with these supply-side hiccups.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"Does that mean the stimulus was mistaken, or is the inflation just a consequence of—that we have to put up with because of that?"
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"No, I’m not expressing any judgment about, about the stimulus in, in that comment."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"And the truth is, this is not the inflation that we were—what we were talking about in the—in the framework was inflation that comes from a tight labor market, right?"
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we had 3½ percent unemployment for a period, and we had inflation that was just barely getting to 2 percent."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I—you know, I think, in that setting, our thinking was, we can afford to wait to raise rates until we see actual inflation rather than [acting] preemptive[ly] because, you know, no one had seen what 3½ percent unemployment would look like—with high labor force participation, by the way."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"No one had seen what it would look—really look like for an extended period, for decades."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,And we didn’t know what the inflationary implications were.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,It turned out there was barely 2 percent inflation—and no sense that it was gaining momentum and that kind of thing.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,So we incorporated that into our framework.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"What I’m saying is, there’s a—there’s a sense among some that “you wanted inflation, this is what you wanted, how do you like it?,” you know?"
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,But those are exactly the decisions we’ll be turning to in coming meetings.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"So [we] haven’t made any decisions at all about, about when runoff would start, but we’re—we’ll be continuing to—you know, in relation to when either liftoff happens or the end of the taper."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, that—as I mentioned, the SEP medians are for 4 percent growth next year, 3½ percent— 3½ percent unemployment at the end of the year, and the, the—you know, headline inflation of 2.6 percent next year, core at 2.7."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"So this is a strong economy, one in which it’s appropriate for, for interest rate hikes."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"So they’re separate, I would say."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"Your—sorry, your second question was?"
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,EVAN RYSER.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,My second question was about runoff.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,Runoff.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,EVAN RYSER.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,In the last cycle.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, you know, with the balance sheet, we did have a balance sheet discussion, sort of a prelim—a first, first discussion of balance sheet issues today, [balance] sheet issues, at our meeting this week."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,We’ll have another at the next meeting and another at the meeting after that I suspect.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,These are interesting issues to discuss.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,[We] didn’t make any decisions today.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"We looked back at what happened in the last cycle, and people thought that was interesting and informative."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"And—but to one degree or another, people noted that this is just a different situation, and those differences should inform the decisions we make about the balance sheet this time."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,I don’t think that’s at all likely in this cycle.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"And wages, that’s, that’s really one of the great signals."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, it’s—So I mentioned a number of other things."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,STEVE LIESMAN.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,Can I just follow up?
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thinking about having to wait, is it still the policy, or the position, of the Committee that you will not raise rates until the taper is complete?"
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,Yes.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"The sense of that, of course, being that buying assets is adding accommodation and raising rates is removing accommodation."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,So I don’t think it’s a question of having to wait.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"Since we’re two meetings away from completing the taper, assuming things go as, as expected, I think if we wanted to lift off before then, then, then what we—you would stop the taper potentially sooner."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"But I do—I do not think it would be appropriate, and we—and we don’t find ourselves in a situation where we—where we might have to raise rates while we’re still purchasing assets."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"Okay, let’s go to Colby at the FT. COLBY SMITH."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you, Michelle."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"Chair Powell, I’m curious exactly how much distance you think there should be between the end of the taper and the first interest rate increase."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"Back in 2014, the guidance was—that was given was for the fed funds rate to remain at the target level for a considerable time after the end of the asset purchase program."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,Is that an approach you support now?
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,But it’s not something I expect to happen.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,Or does the current economic situation warrant something a bit different?
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"They, they change on the expectation of things happening."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"So financial conditions are changing to reflect, you know, the forecasts that we made and basically, which was, I think, fairly in line with what markets were expecting."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"How does continuing to buy assets now, even though it’s at a slower pace, address the current inflation problem?"
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,Won’t the impact of today’s changes not really have any impact for six months or a year down the road on the current inflation problem?
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,And aren’t you actually lengthening that time by continuing to buy assets such that it could be not until the long and variable lag after you end purchases sometime in March that you’ll start to have any impact on the inflation problem?
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, on the first part of your question, which is, “Why not stop purchasing now?,” I would just say this: We’ve learned that, in dealing with balance sheet issues, we’ve learned that it’s best to take a careful sort of methodical approach to make adjustments."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,Markets can be sensitive to it.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,And we thought that this was—this was a doubling of the speed.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"But financial conditions don’t wait to change until, until things actually happen."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,We’re basically two meetings away now from finishing the taper.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we announced it, and that’s what will happen."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, the question of long and variable lags is, is an interesting one."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"That’s, that’s Milton Friedman’s famous statement."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I do think that in this world, where everything is— where the global financial markets are connected together, financial conditions can change very quickly."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"And my own sense is that they get into—financial conditions affect the economy fairly rapidly, longer than the traditional thought of, you know, a year or 18 months."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"Shorter than that, rather."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"But in addition, when we communicate about what we’re going to do, the markets move immediately [in response] to that."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,And we thought that was the appropriate way to go.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we, we haven’t made any decision of that nature."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"And if so, how?"
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,And how close is the economy right now to your judgment of the short-run level of maximum employment?
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,Right.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"So the—you know, the thing is, we’re not going back to the same economy we had in February of 2020."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I think early on, that was—the sense was that that’s where we were headed."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,Has your view of the level of maximum employment changed this year?
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"The post-pandemic labor market, and the economy in general, will be different."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I would say: Look, we’re, we’re at 4.2 percent now and it’s been—the unemployment rate has been dropping very quickly."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,So we’re already in the vicinity of 4 percent.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"The way in which—The important metric that has been disappointing really has been labor force participation, of course, where we had widely thought—I had certainly thought— that, last fall, as unemployment insurance ran off, as vaccinations increased, [and] as schools reopened, that we would see a significant surge, if you will, or at least a surge, in labor force participation."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,So we’ve begun to see some improvement.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,We certainly welcome the 2/10 improvement that we got in the November report.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,But I do think that it’s—it feels likely now that the return to higher participation is going to take longer.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, in fact, that’s, that’s been the pattern in past cycles—that labor force participation has tended to recover in the wake of a strong recovery in unemployment, which is what we’re getting right now."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"And the maximum level of employment that’s consistent with price stability evolves over time within a—within a business cycle and over a longer period, in part reflecting [the] evolution of the factors that affect labor supply, including those related to the pandemic."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"More recently, you have hinted at a possible distinction between the level of maximum employment that’s achievable in the short run versus in the long run."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"Chair Powell, in March you answered a question about maximum employment like this: You said 4 percent would be a nice unemployment rate to get to, but it’ll take more than that to get to maximum employment."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you, Nick Timiraos at the Wall Street Journal."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"And so, no, I wouldn’t say that’s our position at all."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,We really haven’t taken a position on that.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"I will say that we did talk today–We had our first discussion about the balance sheet, for example."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we went through the way—the sequence of events regarding the runoff and that sort of thing with the balance sheet, last time."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,And I think people thought that was an interesting discussion.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"They thought that it was informative, but people pointed out that this is a significantly different economic situation that we have at the current time, and that those—the differences that we see now would tend to influence how we think about the balance sheet."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,And the same thing would be true about raising rates.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,I don’t—I don’t foresee that there would be that kind of very extended wait at this time.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,The economy is so much stronger.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,I was here at the Fed when we lifted off the last time.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"And the economy is so much stronger now, so much closer to full employment."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"Inflation is running well above target, and growth is well above potential."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,There wouldn’t be the need for that kind of long delay.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"Having said that, I—you know, we’ll make this decision in coming meetings, and it’s not—it’s not a decision that the Committee has really focused on yet."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,Let’s go to Nick at the Wall Street Journal.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,NICK TIMIRAOS.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,My question is: If—It’s often said that monetary policy has long and variable lags.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,All right.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,STEVE LIESMAN.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,Supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic and [to] the reopening of the economy have continued to contribute to elevated levels of inflation.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"In particular, bottlenecks and supply constraints are limiting how quickly production can respond to higher demand in the near term."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"These problems have been larger and longer lasting than anticipated, exacerbated by waves of the virus."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"As a result, overall inflation is running well above our 2 percent longer-run goal and will likely continue to do so well into next year."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"While the drivers of higher inflation have been predominantly connected to the dislocations caused by the pandemic, price increases have now spread to a broader range of goods and services."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"Wages have also risen briskly, but, thus far, wage growth has not been a major contributor to the elevated levels of inflation."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,We are attentive to the risks that persistent real wage growth in excess of productivity [growth] could put upward pressure on inflation.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"Compared with the projections made in September, participants have revised their unemployment rate projections noticeably lower for this year and next."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"Like most forecasters, we continue to expect inflation to decline to levels closer to our 2 percent longer-run goal by the end of next year."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"We understand that high inflation imposes significant hardship, especially on those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,We are committed to our price-stability goal.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,We will use our tools both to support the economy and a strong labor market and to prevent higher inflation from becoming entrenched.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,We will be watching carefully to see whether the economy is evolving in line with expectations.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,The Fed’s monetary policy actions have been guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"In support of these goals, the Committee reaffirmed the 0 to ¼ percent target range for the federal funds rate."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,We also updated our assessment of the progress the economy has made toward the criteria specified in our forward guidance for the federal funds rate.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,The median inflation projection of FOMC participants falls from 5.3 percent this year to 2.6 percent next year; this trajectory is notably higher than projected in September.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"Looking ahead, FOMC participants project the labor market to continue to improve, with the median projection for the unemployment rate declining to 3.5 percent by the end of the year."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"How long the labor shortages will persist is unclear, particularly if additional waves of the virus occur."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"At the same time, employers are having difficulties filling job openings, and wages are rising at their fastest pace in many years."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"You can get to 20, if you wanted to, easily, but labor force participation, the unemployment rate, different age groups of—you know, prime-age labor force participation, in particular, gets a lot of focus, the JOLTS data get a lot of focus."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"Transcript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference December 15, 2021 CHAIR POWELL."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,Good afternoon.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"At the Federal Reserve, we are strongly committed to achieving the monetary policy goals that Congress has given us: maximum employment and price stability."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"In addition, in light of the strengthening labor market and elevated inflation pressures, we decided to speed up the reductions in our asset purchases."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"As I will explain, economic developments and changes in the outlook warrant this evolution of monetary policy, which will continue to provide appropriate support for the economy."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"Economic activity is on track to expand at a robust pace this year, reflecting progress on vaccinations and the reopening of the economy."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"Aggregate demand remains very strong, buoyed by fiscal and monetary policy support and the healthy financial positions of households and businesses."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"The rise in COVID cases in recent weeks, along with the emergence of the Omicron variant, pose[s] risks to the outlook."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"Notwithstanding the effects of the virus and supply constraints, FOMC participants continue to foresee rapid growth."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"As shown in our Summary of Economic Projections (SEP), the median projection for real GDP growth stands at 5.5 percent this year and 4 percent next year."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"Amid improving labor market conditions and very strong demand for workers, the economy has been making rapid progress toward maximum employment."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"Job gains have been solid in recent months, averaging 378,000 per month over the last three months."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,The unemployment rate has declined substantially—falling 6/10 of a percentage point since our last meeting and reaching 4.2 percent in November.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"The recent improvements in labor market conditions have narrowed the differences in employment across groups, especially for workers at the lower end of the wage distribution, as well as for African Americans and Hispanics."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"Labor force participation showed a welcome rise in November—but remains subdued, in part reflecting the aging of the population and retirements."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"In addition, some who otherwise would be seeking work report that they are out of the labor force because of factors related to the pandemic, including caregiving needs and ongoing concerns about the virus."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"With inflation having exceeded 2 percent for some time, the Committee expects it will be appropriate to maintain this target range until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee’s assessments of maximum employment."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"So you—it could well have been that this cycle was different because of the short nature of it and the very strong—the number of job openings, for example, you would have thought that that would have pulled people back in."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,All FOMC participants forecast that this remaining test will be met next year.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"Participants expect a gradual pace of policy firming, with the level of the federal funds rate generally near estimates of its longer-run level by the end of 2024."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"In order to set up those hikes, what will maximum employment have to look like?"
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,When will you know that that threshold has been met?
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,And how will that be communicated?
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"So maximum employment, if you look at our Statement on Longer- Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, maximum employment is something that we look at a broad range of indicators."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"And those would include, of course, things like the unemployment rate, the labor force participation rate, job openings, wages, flows in and out of the labor force in various parts of the labor force."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,And there are also three rate hikes penciled in the projections for next year.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,We’d also tend to look broadly and inclusively at different demographic groups and not just at the headline and aggregate numbers.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"The Committee will make a judgment that we’ve achieved labor market conditions consistent with maximum employment when it makes that—it is, admittedly, a judgment call because it’s a range of factors."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"Unlike inflation, where we have one number that sort of dominates, it’s a broad range of things."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, as I mentioned in my opening remarks, in my view, we are making rapid progress toward maximum employment."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"And you see that, of course, in some of the factors that I mentioned."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"Great, thank you."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,Steve at CNBC.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,So that’s a—that’s a judgment for the Committee to make.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,The latest FOMC materials say that the FOMC thinks it will be appropriate to keep rates near zero until labor market conditions reach levels consistent with maximum employment.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"And thank you, Chair Powell, for taking our questions."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you very much, Michelle."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"Of course, these projections do not represent a Committee decision or plan, and no one knows with any certainty where the economy will be a year or more from now."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"At today’s meeting, the Committee also decided to double the pace of reductions in its asset purchases."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"Beginning in mid-January, we will reduce the monthly pace of our net asset purchases by $20 billion for Treasury securities and $10 billion for agency mortgage-backed securities."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"If the economy evolves broadly as expected, similar reductions in the pace of net asset purchases will likely be appropriate each month, implying that increases in our securities holdings would cease by mid-March—a few months sooner than we anticipated in early November."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"We are phasing out our purchases more rapidly because, with elevated inflation pressures and a rapidly strengthening labor market, the economy no longer needs increasing amounts of policy support."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"In addition, a quicker conclusion of our asset purchases will better position policy to address the full range of plausible economic outcomes."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,We remain prepared to adjust the pace of purchases if warranted by changes in the economic outlook.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, even after our balance sheet stops expanding, our holdings of securities will continue to foster accommodative financial conditions."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"To conclude: We understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,Everything we do is in service to our public mission.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,We at the Fed will do everything we can to complete the recovery in employment and achieve our price- stability goal.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,I look forward to your questions.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,Mr.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"Chair, we’ll go to Rachel from the Washington Post."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,RACHEL SIEGEL.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"The median projection for the appropriate level of the federal funds rate is 0.9 percent at the end of 2022, about ½ percentage point higher than projected in September."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, really, it’s the pandemic, it’s a range of factors."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"Today, in support of these goals, the Federal Open Market Committee kept interest rates near zero and updated its assessment of the progress that the economy has made toward the criteria specified in the Committee’s forward guidance for interest rates."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"At the same time, we have to make policy now."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"And the other thing, of course, is, is rents, which are very important."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, owners’ equivalent rent."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s another thing which is very economically sensitive.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"Unlike the things that are causing the inflation now, this is economically sensitive—and so would be expected to move up."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"And so as the—as some things go down, the question is: Where will we be when we come out the other side of this?"
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,And we need to keep our eyes on those things.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,JEANNA SMIALEK.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"But with the kind of hot labor market readings— wages we’re seeing, it’s something that we’re—that we’re watching."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,We’ll go to Chris at the AP.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,CHRISTOPHER RUGABER.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"Well, next year, you could see growth slowing, and you could see some disinflation, particularly if the Omicron variant does spread more widely."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,Would you delay rate hikes in that situation?
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,And how would you think about that?
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,And we don’t see that yet.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,It would take something that was persistent and material for that to happen.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"In particular—we don’t see this yet, but if you had something where wages were persistently— [increases in] real wages were persistently above productivity growth, that puts upward pressure on, on firms, and they raise prices."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I thought for a second there whether we—whether we should increase our taper, [We] decided to go ahead with what we had—what we had “socialized.” Then, right after that, we got the next Friday after the meeting, two days after the meeting, we got a very strong employment report and, you know, revisions to prior readings and, and no increase in labor supply."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"And the Friday after that, we got the CPI, which was a very hot, high reading."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I, honestly, at that point, really decided that I thought we needed to—we needed to look at, at speeding up the taper."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,And we went to work on that.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"So that’s, that’s really what happened."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,It was essentially higher inflation and faster—turns out much faster progress in the labor market.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"Really, what’s happening is the unemployment rate is catching up—seems to be catching up—with a lot of the other readings of a tight labor market, 6/10 [decline] over one cycle."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"So that’s really what happened and, you know, widely supported in the Committee today, as you can see—unanimous vote—but beyond that I think widely, widely supported, you know, this, this move."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,JEANNA SMIALEK.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"If I could just follow up quickly, you noted that the ECI was one of the things that made you nervous, but you also said earlier that you don’t see signs that wages are actually factoring into inflation yet."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I guess I wonder how you think about sort of the wage picture as, as you’re making these assessments."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,Right.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"So—but I said—you, you quoted me correctly."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s, it’s—so far, we don’t see—wages are not a big part of the high-inflation story that we’re seeing."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"As you look forward, let’s assume that the goods economy does sort itself out, and supply chains get working again, and maybe there’s a rebalancing back to services and all that kind of thing."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"But what, what that leaves behind is the other things that can lead to persistent inflation."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"And also, how would you explain rate hikes if you do follow through, in that kind of situation, with inflation fading and growth slowing?"
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"So coming to your real question, we got the ECI reading on the eve of the November meeting—it was the Friday before the November meeting—and it was very high, 5.7 percent reading for the employment compensation index for the third quarter, not annualized, for the third quarter, just before the meeting."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"How would you explain rate hikes to the public, particularly those who may still be looking for work?"
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"Well, as you know, you know, the SEP is not a plan."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"So how do you sort of, like, tease out the signal of maximum employment?"
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,Okay.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,So let me start by saying that the inflation that we got was not at all the inflation we were looking for or talking about in the framework.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,This was—it really was a completely different thing.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"It was to do with, you know, strong monetary policy and fiscal stimulus into an economy that was recovering rapidly, and in which there were these supply-side barriers which effectively led to, you know, in certain parts of the economy, what you might call a vertical supply curve."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, you know, automobile purchases are very interest rate-sensitive, and you would think demand would drive up the quantity of cars, But it can’t, because they don’t have semiconductors."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"And how is—are those signals likely to be clear right now given that you have inflation that’s caused by, you know, these supply chain disruptions that might also lead to, you know, inflation in wages and those sorts of things?"
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, so that—it was a very different kind of inflation."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s nothing to do with our framework.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,And our—the way we’ve approached it is really nothing to do with our framework.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"But coming to maximum employment, which is really your question."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I think you look at, you know, prices and quantities."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"When you—if you want to look at maximum employment, you look at prices and quantities, and the main price you look at is wages."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s one of the things you look at.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"But the reality is, we don’t have a strong labor force participation recovery yet, and we may not have it for some time."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,This is not the inflation we were looking for under our framework at all.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,So is that understanding correct?
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"But from what I understand, that’s still basically: The way that you know that you’re there is inflation."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, I’m wondering, you know, you’ve talked a lot about the different ways that you might measure maximum employment."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s not something we debate, negotiate over, or really discuss in terms of what the right answer should be."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"People write down their, their assumptions—their assessment of appropriate policy based on their economic forecast."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"And so the median—what you’re talking about, the three rate increases, that’s the median of the Committee—the median of the Committee is also that growth will be 4 percent and then unemployment will be 3½ percent by the end of the year."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,So that’s a really strong economy.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, of course, if the—if the economy turns out to be quite different from that, then so will the rate."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, we—no one will say, “Oh, we can’t change our policy because we wrote something down in December.” No one’s ever said that or will."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,It will—the actual rate decisions we make will depend on our evolving assessment of the forecast.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, for example, if, if the economy were to slow down significantly, then you would expect that that would have an effect of slowing down rate increases."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"But we’d have to—you know, we look at our two goals, maximum employment and price stability, and we make policy based on them, and not with respect to what we wrote down in a prior SEP. MICHELLE SMITH."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,Let’s go to Victoria Guida at Politico.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,VICTORIA GUIDA.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Chair Powell."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,I wanted to follow up on maximum employment.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, you know, the new framework was basically designed, as I understand it, so that there was a de-emphasis on guessing where inflation would pick up because of employment."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, basically, you were going to wait until you saw the whites of the eyes of inflation."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,And that’s how you would kind of know that you reached maximum employment.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,So we’ve been adapting—I’ve been saying we’re adapting our policy.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,How do you know?
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, of course, I said so on many occasions, and one of the consequences of that is that we move the taper forward."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thanks, as usual."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I guess I gotta ask about the elephant in the room, which is the Omicron variant."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, this seems to already be pushing one of your colleagues, the Bank of England, off its course."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,Things have evolved very fast there.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,Hasn’t quite hit the shores of the U.S. in full force yet.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,But people seem to expect it to.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I’m wondering, in your feelings about this, are you convinced that this is going to be perhaps a more infectious, but less serious, variant of the virus?"
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,HOWARD SCHNEIDER.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,Or are you simply confident that the U.S. economy can continue its divorce from the pandemic?
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"Well, I think there’s a lot of uncertainty, which is why we—why we called it out in our statement, our postmeeting statement, as a risk."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s—we, we follow the same experts and I—we, we talk privately to the same experts that everyone else does and read the same articles in the paper and the same research and, you know, so the—you mentioned the early assessment is highly transmissible, perhaps not as severe, some continuing protection from, from existing vaccines and also existing immunity from having had the disease."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s a first draft.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,We’re a long way from knowing what it will turn out to be.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,It may well come to the United States and replace Delta as the dominant variant fairly quickly.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,That could easily happen.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think there’s another step there, though—which is what’s going to be the effect on the economy."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"And that will depend, you know, on how much it suppresses demand as opposed to suppressing supply."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,We’ll go to Howard at Reuters.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,We moved the taper forward and we—and it’s a much faster taper than had been planned.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,So this is something we need to take into—take into account.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,NICK TIMIRAOS.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,And so does that mean that the Committee might feel compelled to raise interest rates before you’re convinced that you’ve achieved the employment test in your forward guidance?
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,So this is—this is not at all a decision that the Committee has made.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,But you’re really asking a question about how our framework works.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, yes, there is a— there’s a provision, it used to be called the “balanced approach” provision, that says, in effect, that in situations in which the pursuit of the maximum-employment goal and [the pursuit of] the price-stability goal are not complementary, we have to take account of the distance from the goal and the—and the speed at which we’re approaching it."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,I’ve talked about it on a number of occasions.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"It, it is a provision that would enable us to, in this case, because of high inflation, move before achieving maximum employment."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"Now, we’re—as I said, we’re making rapid progress toward maximum employment in my—in my thinking, in my opinion."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I don’t at all know that we will—that we’ll have to invoke that, that paragraph."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"But just as a factual matter, that is part of our framework—and has been, really, for a very long time."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,NICK TIMIRAOS.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"And so that is, in effect, an “off-ramp” which could, in concept, be taken and it’s in our framework, it’s been in our framework a long time."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"It is not clear how big the effects would be on either inflation or growth or hiring on top of what’s already going on, which is quite a strong, you know, wave of Delta that’s hitting large parts of the country across the northern United States and all the way to the eastern seaboard and now coming down."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"If I could—if I could follow up, you’ve talked recently about risk management."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"So coming in on top of that, again, it’s very difficult to say what the economic effects would be."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,Let’s go to Jeanna at the New York Times.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,JEANNA SMIALEK.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hey, Chairman Powell."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks for taking our questions.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,I wonder if you could talk a little bit about what prompted your recent pivot toward greater wariness around inflation.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,Sure.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I guess I would go back and—you know, it’s been a continual process, really."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"Inflation really popped up, right?"
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,In the late spring last year.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we had a view—it was very, very widely held in the forecasting community—that this would be temporary."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"It was quite narrow, you know, a limited number of factors were causing it."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"And there was a decent amount of evidence to support that view, that it would be temporary or transitory, as we said."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"Certainly, we had five months of declining month on month—monthly readings of inflation, but we didn’t see much in the way of progress on labor supply or on other supply-side issues."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,We’re having quite a wave of Delta.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"Then in September, I’d say after Labor Day, we started to see—it started to become clear that this was both larger in its effect on inflation and more persistent."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,HOWARD SCHNEIDER.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,And inflation is well above target.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think moving, you know, moving forward the end of our taper by a few months is really—is really an appropriate thing to do."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I think, really, Omicron doesn’t really have much to do with that."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"So [vaccinated] people who get the new variant, it affects them much less than it tends to affect, in the aggregate, people who are not vaccinated."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"So the more people get vaccinated, the less the economic effect."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,More and more people are getting vaccinated.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,It doesn’t mean it won’t have an economic effect.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"I do think, wave upon wave, people are learning to live with this."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,And it actually—it had an effect on global supply chains.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,And that sort of—that hurt the process of the global supply chains getting worked out.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,Delta had an effect of slowing down hiring.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"I just think, at this point, we don’t know much."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’ll know a whole lot more in three weeks, and we’ll know more than that in six weeks."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,HOWARD SCHNEIDER.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"But if I can follow up: You’re clearly, sort of from a risk standpoint, comfortable putting away one of your tools pretty soon."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"Which sort of implies that whatever Omicron brings, you’re comfortable the economy can handle it without quantitative easing."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,Yes.
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"Yes, look, I think—if you look at the state of the economy and the amount—the strength of demand, the strength of just overall demand, and the strength of demand for labor, look at inflation, look at wages."
2021-12-15,Press Conf - Full Text,So it can have an economic effect.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"So that’s, that’s, that’s how we think about that."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,We haven’t made—to your specific question—we really have not addressed those questions.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,And we’ll begin to address them as we—as we move into the March meeting and meetings after that.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,Let’s go to Rachel.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,RACHEL SIEGEL.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"And thank you, Chair Powell, for taking our questions."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"I’m wondering if you can talk to us about any metrics that the Fed uses to assess how inflation affects different groups of Americans, especially lower-, lower-income earners?"
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"And are you worried that the Fed underestimates, or can’t effectively measure, the impact of inflation on some of the most vulnerable households?"
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"So it’s, it’s more a matter of—I think the problem that we’re—that we’re talking about here is really that people who are on fixed incomes who are living paycheck to paycheck, they’re spending most or all of their—of, of what they’re earning on food, gasoline, rent, heating their—heating, things like that, basic necessities."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"And so inflation right away, right away forces people like that to make very difficult decisions."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,So that’s really the point.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you, Michelle."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"But it’s not happening very quickly, and it may not—it may continue to not happen very quickly as long as the pandemic is on[going]."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"We have growth—even in forecasts, even in the somewhat reduced forecast for 2022—we still see growth higher than, substantially higher than what we estimate to be the potential growth rate."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"Some part of those retirements are, are, you know, related to COVID rather than just regular retirements."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you, Michelle."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"Chair Powell, when you talk about being humble and nimble about the path forward for monetary policy, does that also include the possibility of raising interest rates by larger increments and, say, doing a 50 basis point hike at some point if inflation does not moderate sufficiently?"
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,And should we interpret this approach as a departure from the gradual pace that we saw during the last hiking cycle?
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, as I mentioned, we have not made these decisions."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,We really haven’t.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, and what I can tell you now, though, is that we fully appreciate that this is a different situation."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"If you look back to where we were in 2015, ’16, ’17, ’18 when we were raising rates, inflation was very close to 2 percent, even below 2 percent."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"Unemployment was, was not at our estimates of the natural rate."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"And growth was, you know, in the 2 to 3 percent range."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"Right now, we have inflation running substantially above 2 percent and, and, you know, more persistently than we would like."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we see a labor market where, by so many measures, it is historically tight."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think the—you know, in a way, the least tight aspect of it is, is looking at the unemployment rate, which is still below our median estimate of, of [the unemployment rate consistent with] maximum employment."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"If you look at things like quits and job openings, as I mentioned earlier, and wages, you’re seeing—and, and just the ratio of job openings to unemployed—you’re seeing a very, very tight labor market."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"Now, we also know that labor force participation is significantly lower."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s 1½ percentage points lower than it was in February of 2020.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"Maybe a [full] percentage point of that is, is retirements."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we think there’s, there’s a pool of people out there who could come back into the labor force."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"I don’t—I’m not aware of, you know, inflation literally falling more on, on different socioeconomic groups."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"The point is, some people are just really in a—prone to suffer more."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I, I would not say that I would expect the supply chain issues to be completely worked out by the end of this year."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"I do not expect them, and I have not expected them."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"What I would say, and I have been saying, is that I expect progress to be made in the second half of this year, mainly—progress because we’re not making much progress."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"If you look at a ton of metrics, you can find some that suggest that delivery times are shorter and inventories in some industries moving up."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, overall, we’re not—we’re not making progress."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, things like the semiconductor issue are going to—they’re going to be quite a long time."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,I would think they’ll go more than through 2023.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"In terms of—so in terms of being too late, I would just say this."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we think we are positioned to make the changes in our policy to do that, and, and we’re committed to doing that."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"And that’s, that’s really where we are."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"In terms of your, your question about the, the size of rate increases, we haven’t—we haven’t faced those decisions."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,COLBY SMITH.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,We haven’t made them.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,It isn’t possible to sit down here today and tell you with any confidence what the—what the precise path will be.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"But in—as we work our way through this, meeting by meeting, we are aware that this is a very different, different expansion, as I’ve said a couple times, with higher inflation, higher growth, a much stronger economy."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"We—our policy needs to be positioned to address the full range of plausible outcomes, as I said, and particularly the possibility that inflation will continue to run higher, more persistently than we’d expected."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s—that’s not the point.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,So today you said inflation will start to ease this year.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mean, for people who are economically well off, inflation isn’t good."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s bad.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"High inflation is, is bad, but they’re going to be able to continue to eat and keep their homes and drive their cars and things like that."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s more—so that, that’s really how I think of it."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, we, we have to control inflation for the benefit of all Americans."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"But part of—part of it is just that it’s particularly hard on people with fixed incomes and low incomes who spent most of their—of their income on necessities, which are—which are experiencing high inflation now."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,I want to drill down and get a timeline that you see as to when we could see that relief.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,Let’s go to Edward Lawrence.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thanks, Michelle, and thank you, Mr. Chairman, for taking the question here."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"So year over year, inflation’s at a 40-year high."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,The [increase in] input costs for producer price index for all of 2021 was the highest on record.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,Some investors fear that the Fed might be moving too late.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"Now, you said no decisions were made on the path of rate hikes, but was a rate hike more than 25 basis points discussed today?"
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"And as a follow to that—because I have problems with the mute button—as a follow to that, you testified that the supply chain issues could be worked out by the end of the year."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"The CEO of Ford, though, told Fox Business today that the chip shortage will last into 2023."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,EDWARD LAWRENCE.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,You talked about that today.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,So I think if you look at the—the FOMC participants are—there’s a range there.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"Okay, okay."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,We’ll go to Jeanna now.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,JEANNA SMIALEK.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thanks for taking our questions, Chair Powell."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,And sorry for my tech issues.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,CRAIG TORRES.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,I wonder if you could tell us a little bit about where your thinking on inflation stands today.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,And I wonder if you still think that projection from December is a reasonable one.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"And if your thinking has changed at all, I wonder how you’re thinking about that."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,And I also wonder if you could talk a little bit about the pathway to getting to that deceleration.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"Like, how do—how do we get from here, 7 percent CPI, to where you expect to be at the end of the year?"
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I’d say, you know, since, since the December meeting, I would say that the inflation situation is about the same but probably slightly worse."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,I’d be inclined to raise my own estimate of 2022 core PCE inflation—let’s just go with that—by a few tenths today.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, the last time we saw an SEP back in September, we saw that you and your colleagues were projecting that inflation would sort of sink back down quite close to target by the end of the year."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"But we’re not writing, writing down an SEP at this meeting."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,And I’m sorry I can’t.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,I seek to play no role in it.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, a couple things."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"One, Omi—COVID is not over."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,And I think those differences are likely to be reflected in—in the policy that we implement.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"And COVID can continue to evolve, and it’s just—we have to accept that it’s not over, and the risks to it can slow down growth."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,And that would be—that’s sort of a downside risk from a growth standpoint.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"I would point to—you know, another, another risk is just further, further problems in the supply chains, which could slow down activity."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"And you see the situation in China as a situation there where that’s—their no-COVID policy may cause more lockdowns, is likely to, and that may play into—may play into more problems in supply chains."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,And I don’t—I really—I can’t help you here today on this issue.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"In addition, there’s what’s going on in Eastern Europe and things like that."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we, you know, we can’t—we can’t forget that there are risks on both sides."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"So that’s, that’s there."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s what I would say.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"I know you’ve been all over this issue with, with my colleagues, Craig, on the issue of, of information."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,We don’t—we don’t have that information at the Board.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, I hand— I asked the inspector general to do an investigation, and that is out of my hands."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,I play no role in it.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,So there’s plenty of risk out there.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,Let’s go to Colby Smith.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,But I think it’s—it hasn’t gotten better.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s been the pattern.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,And so we’ll be watching that.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I, you know, we—our objective is to get inflation back down to 2 percent."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s also to provide enough support to keep the labor market healthy.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"The labor market is very, very strong right now, and I think that that strength will continue."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,There’s a—there’s really a shortage of workers.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,We see it particularly among production and nonsupervisory workers and people in the lowest quartile.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,You see very large wage increases.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, really, what’s—the question is going to be, what is inflation running at?"
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,I mentioned some of the other indicators.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we’re also—you know, we realize, I think, as everyone does, that this outlook is quite uncertain and that we’re going to have to adapt."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,And we’re going to communicate as clearly as we can.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"But we’re going to have to be adaptable and, you know, move, move as appropriate."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,JEANNA SMIALEK.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,Great.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I think that’s, that’s what we’re looking at."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s probably gotten just a—just a bit worse, and that’s been the pattern."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,I do think we’ll come off of the highs that we saw in the early part of this episode in the—in the spring last year.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"Now, what we’re learning is, it’s just taking much longer, so I think—longer than expected."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"And that range has been moving to the right for, for a year now."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, by the way, if you look at other forecasters, essentially all other macro forecasters who do this for a living, you’ve seen the same pattern."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, what do we think about that?"
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"Well, I think we, you know, we wrote down rate increases in the December meetings, each of us individually."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I think to the extent the situation deteriorates further, our policy will have to address that, if it deteriorates meaningfully further, either in the time dimension or in the size of the inflation dimension."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,So that’s how we’re thinking about it.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"I—as I mentioned, though, I think it’s—part of this will be that us, the Fed, moving away from a very highly accommodative policy to a substantially less accommodative policy and then, over time, to a policy that’s not accommodative, in time."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"And that, I think, does raise, raise the risk that high inflation will be more persistent."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,I don’t know when that will be.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"That’s, that’s part of it."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,Another part of it is that fiscal policy provided an impulse to growth over the last two years.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"That impulse will be less, in fact, will be—will be negative this year."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,And so that’s another thing.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"The other one is, we will eventually get relief on the supply side."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, the ports will be cleared up."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,And there will be semiconductors and things like that.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s—those are the things that we’re—that we’re thinking about.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,JEAN YUNG.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,Let’s go to Mike McKee.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,I don’t know.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,But it would really depend on the— on the facts and circumstances at that time.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,Let’s go to Brian Cheung for the last question.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,BRIAN CHEUNG.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Chairman Powell."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"And it—and the fact that our rates are so much higher than, than other risk-free sovereign rates around the world may put something of a ceiling on our—on our rates."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"Brian Cheung, Yahoo Finance."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"And then, secondly, within the context of hiking cycles, it’s often the talking point for financial stability and wanting to make sure that asset bubbles don’t emerge."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,Is that something that has also factored into the conversation as you start to think about hiking rates?
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,I would describe what we’re doing along these lines.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,This is going to be a year in which we move steadily away from the very highly accommodative monetary policy that we put in place to deal with the—with the economic effects of the pandemic.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,And that’s going to involve a number of things.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"Within the context of just the broad effort to normalize rates, would you describe what you want to do as a gradual hiking?"
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s going to involve and does involve finishing asset purchases.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"Obviously, U.S. long-term sovereign debt is an—is an important global asset."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we, we do monitor the slope of the yield curve, but we don’t control the slope of the yield curve."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,Many flat—many factors influence longer-term interest rates.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"But it is something that we watch, and, and you will know that from when we had this issue a few years ago."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we take it into account, along with many other financial conditions, as we try to assess the implications of all those conditions for the economic outlook."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"So that’s, that’s one thing I would say."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"Another is, currently, you’ve got a slope."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’d—that’s, that’s a good question in, in real time."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"If you think about 2s to 10s, 2-year Treasury to 10-year Treasury, I think that’s around 75 basis points."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,So it’s something we’re monitoring.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,We don’t think of it as—I don’t think of it as some kind of an iron law.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,But we do look at it and try to understand the implications and what it’s telling us.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,And it’s—but it’s one of many things that we monitor.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,JEAN YUNG.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"Can I follow up real quick and ask, if it—if it did invert, would you tie it to U.S. fundamentals?"
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,Or would it be driven by a much broader set of factors?
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s well within the range of a normal—of a normal yield-curve slope.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"Would that worry you, and how important is that risk in the Fed’s consideration for adjusting policy?"
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s going to involve lifting off.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we, we have—we’re going to write down in March our next assessment of what that might be."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,I would just say this.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"We, we, of course, have a financial stability framework."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"And what it shows is a number of, of positive aspects of financial stability."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"But you mentioned, really, [the behavior of] asset prices is one of the four."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"So asset prices are somewhat elevated, and they reflect a high risk appetite and that sort of thing."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"I don’t really think asset prices themselves represent a significant threat to financial stability, and that’s because households are in good shape financially than they have been."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,I didn’t know if that was part of the discussion today.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,Businesses are in good shape financially.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,The banks are highly capitalized with high liquidity and quite resilient and strong.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"There are some concerns in the—in the nonbank financial sector around—still around money market funds, although the SEC is making—has made some very positive proposals there."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we also saw some things in the Treasury market during the acute phase of the crisis, which, which we’re looking at ways to address."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, overall, the financial stability vulnerabilities are manageable—are manageable, I would say."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you very much.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,So I mentioned two-sided risks.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,Defaults on business loans are low and that kind of thing.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,And it’s going to involve additional rate increases as appropriate.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"Within the context of other hiking cycles, it seems like [a set of] worries about asset bubbles emerging as a result of easy rates has been part of that ."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,BRIAN CHEUNG.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s going to continue to evolve as the data evolve.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"We need to be quite adaptable, I think, in our understanding of this."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"The last thing we’re going to do is, we’re going to have a couple more meetings, I think, to talk about allowing the balance sheet to begin to run off and [to] do so in a predictable manner."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"And that’s, that’s something that we will also be doing as appropriate."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,And I wouldn’t—I don’t think it’s possible to say exactly how this is going to go.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we’re, we’re going to need to be, as I’ve mentioned, nimble about this."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,And the economy is quite different this time.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,Yes.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,I’ve said this several times now.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s stronger.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,Inflation is higher.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"The labor market is much, much stronger than it was."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"And growth is above trend, even this year, let alone last year."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,So all of those things are going to go into our thinking as we make—as we make monetary policy.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,And you asked about financial stability concerns.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,In connection with our policy–was that your question?
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,The economy is quite different.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"Chair Powell, some investors are expecting the yield curve could flatten, or even invert, after rate hikes begin."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,Let’s go to Jean Yung.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,And you have growth this year at—forecast to be well above—well above potential.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mean, people who are forecasting growth think potential growth is around 2 [percent]."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"Most forecasts [of actual growth] are significantly above that for 2022, and that’s even with, with policy becoming substantially less accommodative."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,So the labor market’s going to be strong for some time.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’re—ideally, what we’re trying to achieve is inflation getting back down to 2 percent."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we’re trying to do that in a process that, that, that accomplishes—you know, that will also leave the labor market in a very strong position."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,And no one really knows what that will take.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mean, I would say you have a tremendously strong labor market."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"Again, I would say that it isn’t just monetary policy that’s helping inflation get down."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,So—but monetary policy will do our job.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,It is our job to get inflation down to 2 percent.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"And a situation where, where the two goals are—the two goals can be in tension is a difficult one."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"But I—but I don’t really think they are here, though, because I think a really significant threat to further strengthening in the labor market in the form of higher participation over time is high inflation."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"And also, high inflation is taking away the benefits of some of these larger wage increases that we’re seeing now."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we do hope to achieve, and our plan is to achieve, both of those goals."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHAEL MCKEE.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’ll be supply-side improvements, and it’ll be less, less fiscal, you know, less fiscal impulse in all likelihood."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"If I could—if I could follow up, does the danger of tightening too much as policy works its way into the economy with a lag mean that you should go back to being more forecast dependent in making decisions, rather than the state dependency you’ve been using as a framework for the last year and a half or so?"
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,Nothing like that.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"I was asking if you’re protecting the employment side of the mandate, whether there’s some sort of circuit breaker there."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHAEL MCKEE.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"I’d like to sort of weave some of the strands of your answers together and ask you, as you start to reverse policy, what your goal is."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,Are you going to be raising interest rates until you get inflation to 2 percent?
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"Do you want to go below 2 percent so that, on average, you get a 2 percent inflation rate?"
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"And because you said we have to protect the employment part of your mandate, is there some sort of circuit breaker that would stop you from raising interest rates on the employment side?"
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, no."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"So the answer to that is, is “no.” What we’re trying to do is get inflation, keep inflation expectations well anchored at 2 percent."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"That’s, that’s always the, the ultimate goal."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,And we do that in the service of having inflation—we get to that goal by having inflation average 2 percent over time.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"And if inflation doesn’t average 2 percent over time, then it’s not clear why inflation expectations would be anchored at 2 percent."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"So that, that’s the way we think about that."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, it—what was the last part of your—of your question?"
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHAEL MCKEE.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"There’s no—there’s nothing in our framework about having inflation run below 2 percent so that we would do that, try to achieve that outcome."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thanks, Michelle."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"And so that was a very state-dependent thought because, for a long time, we’d been tightening on the expectation of high inflation, which never appeared."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, now—so, what we have now is, we have the strongest recovery of any, any country."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we have—we have a recovery that looks completely unlike other recoveries that we’ve had, because we’ve, we’ve put so much support behind the recovery."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we’re managing the, the relatively high-class problems that come with that, which are high inflation and a labor shortage."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"So—and these are serious problems, very serious problems that we, you know, we’re working as hard as we can on."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,Was it too much?
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"Again, I’m going to leave that to the historians."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"And—but look, in 25 years, we’ll look back at this incident, which will be a, you know, 2-, 3-, 4-, 5-year period."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,And what we did was a lot.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we’ll say, you know, we’ll have a—we’ll have a much better basis to make a judgment about the actions that people took."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,And I guess I’ll have to leave it at that.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,I look for—I hope I’ll be around to see how that looks in 25 years.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHAEL DERBY.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,Fair enough.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"But it was all founded, though, in a—in a very strong reaction to a, you know, to a unique historical event."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"State dependency was particularly around the thought that if we—if we saw a very strong labor market, we would wait to see actual inflation—actual inflation before we tightened."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"So now, that was a lot of—that was a lot."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,And we responded.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"And that was the case for, for a number of years."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"So in this particular situation, we will be clearly monitoring incoming data as well as the evolving outlook."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,Let’s go to Michael Derby.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHAEL DERBY.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you for taking my question.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"I want to ask you, with the benefit of hindsight, and I realize, I mean, that is what it is."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"And what we were able to do was, you know, stave off a collapse of the financial system at the beginning and make time for what really needed to happen, which was the income replacement and then the recovery that Congress enabled with the CARES Act."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"But do you feel that, you know, monetary policy and fiscal policy maybe did too much to react to the crisis and that part of the inflation problem that we’re having right now is because the government response, you know, collectively was more than what the economy ended up needing?"
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I think it’s too soon to write that history, really."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,But what I would say is this.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"The—if you remember what it felt like at the beginning of the pandemic, literally the global economy shutting down in large part, including our own economy, and people going to their homes for weeks on end in masks, and there are no vaccines, and it could be a really long time to get them, you know."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"And then, you know, you have—economic activity drops by a shocking amount in one—so there was a real risk of lasting damage."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I think Congress responded remarkably with the—with the CARES Act, incredibly timely and very powerful."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,People will—there’ll always be flaws in these things.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"But in real time, it was a remarkable achievement."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"That’s going to require price stability, and that’s going to require the Fed to tighten interest rate policy and do our part in getting inflation back down to our 2 percent goal."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, of course, that is a risk to the—to the—to the expansion."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,It could have gone on for years were it not hit by the pandemic.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"In the particular situation we’re in now, it may well increase."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,Max—the level of maximum—of employment that’s consistent with stable prices may increase.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we hope that it will, as more people come back into the labor market, as participation gradually rises."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,And the policy path that we’re broadly contemplating would be supportive of that comment—that outcome as well.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"So the thing about the labor market right now is that there are—there are many millions of, of more job openings than there are unemployed people."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"So you ask whether we can— whether we can raise rates and, and move to less accommodative, and even tight, financial conditions without hurting the labor market."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,I think there’s quite a bit of room to raise interest rates without threatening the labor market.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"This is, by so many measures, a historically tight labor market."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"Record levels of job openings, of quits."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,Wages are moving up at the highest pace they have in decades.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"If you look at surveys of workers, they find jobs plentiful."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,Look at surveys of companies—they find workers scarce.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"And all of those readings are at levels, really, that we haven’t seen in a long time—and, in some cases, ever."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"So this is a very, very strong labor market, and my strong sense is that we can—we can—we can move rates up without, without having to, you know, severely undermine it."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"I also would point out that there are—there are other forces at work this year, which should also help bring down inflation, we hope, including improvement on the supply side, which will ultimately come."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"The other thing is, maximum employment will, will evolve over time and through the course of the business cycle."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, and, again, very broad support on the Committee for the judgment that it will soon be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,And that is—that is my personal view.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,And I would say that most FOMC participants agree that labor market conditions are consistent with maximum employment in the sense of the highest level of employment that is consistent with price stability.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,The labor market is far stronger.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"Inflation is running well above our 2 percent target, much higher than it was at that time."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,And these differences are likely to have important implications for the appropriate pace of policy adjustments.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"Beyond that, we haven’t made any decisions."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,Let’s go to Victoria Guida at Politico.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,The timing and pace of that are uncertain.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,VICTORIA GUIDA.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"I wanted to ask, you were talking about the health of the labor market."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,And I’m curious whether you would characterize where we’re at right now as maximum employment.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"And also, along those same lines, obviously rate hikes [are] on the table this year, do you think that the Fed can raise rates, bring inflation under control without hurting jobs and wages?"
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,Sorry.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"Just getting both, both parts of your question written down."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,So I would say—and this view is widely held on the Committee—that both sides of the mandate are calling for us to move steadily away from the very highly accommodative policies we put in place during the challenging economic conditions that the economy faced earlier in the pandemic.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Chair Powell."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"And also, fiscal policy is going to be less supportive of, of growth this year—not of the level of economic activity, but the fiscal impulse to growth will be significantly lower."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,So there are multiple forces—which should be working over the course of the year for inflation to come down.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"We do realize that the timing and pace of that are, are highly uncertain and that inflation has persisted longer than we—than we thought."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,I can’t tell you how long it will take.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"But—and then, you know, at the appropriate time, we’ll provide additional information."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I did—the last cycle when we—when we went through balance sheet issues, we did find that over, over the course of two or three meetings, for example, we did come to interesting and better answers, we thought."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,So we’re just in that process now.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"And at the next meeting, we’ll be turning to, you know, more of the details that you’re—that you’re asking about."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,I would say this.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"The balance sheet is, is much bigger."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,I can’t tell you how many.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,I’d say it has a shorter duration than the last time.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"So—and I think that leads you to—and I said, I’ve said this—being willing to move sooner than we did the last time and also perhaps faster."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"But beyond that, it’s really—it’s really not appropriate for me to speculate exactly what that would be."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, and—but I would point you to principle number one, which is “the Committee views changes in the target range for the federal funds rate as its primary means of adjusting the stance of monetary policy.” So we do want the federal funds rate—we, we want to operationalize that [as the primary means]."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we want the balance sheet to be declining in a predictable manner, and we want it to be declining primarily by adjusting reinvestments."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,NICK TIMIRAOS.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, if I could follow on that, raising rates and reducing the balance sheet both restrain the economy, both tighten monetary policy."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,How should we think about the relationship between the two?
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"And the economy’s much stronger, and inflation is much higher."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"So more to your question, we know that the economy is in a very different place than it was when we began raising rates in 2015."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I expect that this process will, will be something that we spend time on in coming meetings."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"At this meeting, we’ve gone through and carefully put together a set of principles at a high level."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, of course, we’re prepared to use our tools to assure that higher inflation does not become entrenched."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,Let’s go to Nick Timiraos at the Wall Street Journal.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,NICK TIMIRAOS.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"Good afternoon, Chair Powell."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"And those are meant to guide the actual decisions we’ll make about the pace and about all of the questions that you’re, you’re asking."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"I, I have a couple of questions on the balance sheet."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,What does that mean?
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"And then, apart from moving sooner and faster to shrink the holdings, are there any other ways in which you and your colleagues are seriously thinking about recalibrating this process?"
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, finally, how much disagreement is there around how you should use this tool, including active sales rather than passive sales or changes in the composition of reinvestments?"
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I’m afraid to tell you that those are all great questions, and they’re questions that the Committee is just turning to now."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we had—we had a discussion, as you know, at the last meeting, an introductory discussion of the balance sheet and a teeing up of the issues."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,The statement on the balance sheet today calls for “significantly reducing” your holdings.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"In fact, what I’ll say is that we’re going to be led by the incoming data and the evolving outlook, which we’ll try to communicate as clearly as possible, moving steadily and transparency—transparently."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"So—and, and I’ll say also that we’re going to be guided by the data."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,We’re going to have to navigate crosscurrents and actually two-sided risks now.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"The improvements in labor market conditions have been widespread, including for workers at the lower end of the wage distribution, as well as for African Americans and Hispanics."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,Labor demand remains historically strong.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"With constraints on labor supply, employers are having difficulties filling job openings, and wages are rising at their fastest pace in many years."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"While labor force participation has edged up, it remains subdued, in part reflecting the aging of the population and retirements."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"In addition, some who would otherwise would be seeking work report that they are out of the labor force because of factors related to the pandemic, including caregiving needs and ongoing concerns about the virus."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,The current wave of the virus may well prolong these effects.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"Over time, there are good reasons to expect some further improvements in participation and employment."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"The unemployment rate has declined sharply, falling 2 percentage points over the past six months to reach 3.9 percent in December."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,Inflation remains well above our longer-run goal of 2 percent.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"In particular, bottlenecks and supply constraints are limiting how quickly production can respond to higher demand in the near term."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"These problems have been larger and longer lasting than anticipated, exacerbated by waves of the virus."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"While the drivers of higher inflation have been predominantly connected to the dislocations caused by the pandemic, price increases have now spread to a broader range of goods and services."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"Wages have also risen briskly, and we are attentive to the risks that persistent real wage growth in excess of productivity [growth] could put upward pressure on inflation."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"Like most forecasters, we continue to expect inflation to decline over the course of the year."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"We understand that high inflation imposes significant hardship, especially on those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"In addition, we believe that the best thing we can do to support continued labor market gains is to promote a long expansion, and that will require price stability."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,Supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic and [to] the reopening of the economy have continued to contribute to elevated levels of inflation.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,We are committed to our price-stability goal.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"Over the past year, payroll employment has risen by 6.4 million jobs."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"The labor market has made remarkable progress and, by many measures, is very strong."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,So we’d love to find a way to get back to that.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"Transcript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference January 26, 2022 CHAIR POWELL."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,Good afternoon.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"At the Federal Reserve, we are strongly committed to achieving the monetary policy goals that Congress has given us: maximum employment and price stability."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"Today, in support of these goals, the Federal Open Market Committee kept its policy interest rate near zero and stated its expectation that an increase in this rate would soon be appropriate."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,The Committee also agreed to continue reducing its net asset purchases on the schedule we announced in December—bringing them to an end in early March.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"As I will explain, against a backdrop of elevated inflation and a strong labor market, our policy has been adapting to the evolving economic environment, and it will continue to do so."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"Job gains have been solid in recent months, averaging 365,000 per month over the past three months."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"Economic activity expanded at a robust pace last year, reflecting progress on vaccinations and the reopening of the economy, fiscal and monetary policy support, and the healthy financial positions of households and businesses."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,The recent sharp rise in COVID cases associated with the Omicron variant will surely weigh on economic growth this quarter.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"High-frequency indicators point to reduced spending in COVID-sensitive sectors, such as travel and restaurants."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"And activity more broadly may also be affected as many workers are unable to report for work because of illness, quarantines, or caregiving needs."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"Fortunately, health experts are finding that the Omicron variant has not been as virulent as previous strains of the virus, and they expect that cases will drop off rapidly."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"If the wave passes quickly, the economic effects should as well, and we would see a return to strong growth."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"That said, the implications for the economy remain uncertain."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we have not lost sight of the fact that for many afflicted individuals and families, and for the health-care workers on the front lines, the virus continues to cause great hardship."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"Indeed, the economy has shown great strength and resilience in the face of the ongoing pandemic."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"For example, how much passive runoff is equal to every ¼ percentage point increase in your benchmark rate?"
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,We will use our tools both to support the economy and a strong labor market and to prevent higher inflation from becoming entrenched.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,The Fed’s monetary policy actions have been guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"For the first question, we’ll go to Chris Rugaber at the Associated Press."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,CHRISTOPHER RUGABER.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thanks, Michelle."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"And thank you, Chair Powell."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"So it’s expected that the Fed will hike rates perhaps every other meeting, but certainly in the past, the Fed has hiked at every meeting."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,I look forward to your questions.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I just wanted to ask, you know, are rate hikes at consecutive meetings on the table this year?"
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, on that note, would the Fed consider front-loading some of its rate hikes, even if it doesn’t raise at every meeting?"
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, as I—as I referred to in my opening statement, it’s—it is not possible to predict with much confidence exactly what path for our policy rate is going to prove appropriate."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"And so, at this time, we haven’t made any decisions about the path of policy."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,And I stress again that we’ll be humble and nimble.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,Is every meeting a live—a live meeting?
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,And we’ll be watching carefully to see whether the economy is evolving in line with expectations.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,Everything we do is in service to our public mission.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"As I noted, the Committee left the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged and reaffirmed our plan, announced in December, to end asset purchases in early March."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"In light of the remarkable progress we’ve seen in the labor market and inflation that is well above our 2 percent longer-run goal, the economy no longer needs sustained high levels of monetary policy support."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,That is why we are phasing out our asset purchases and why we expect it will soon be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"Of course, the economic outlook remains highly uncertain."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"Making appropriate monetary policy in this environment requires humility, recognizing that the economy evolves in unexpected ways."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,We’ll need to be nimble so that we can respond to the full range of plausible outcomes.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"With this in mind, we will remain attentive to risks, including the risk that high inflation is more persistent than expected, and are prepared to respond as appropriate to achieve our goals."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,We at the Federal Reserve will do everything we can to achieve our maximum-employment and price- stability goals.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"To provide greater clarity about our approach for reducing the size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet, today the Committee issued a set of principles that will provide a foundation for our future decisions."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,Reductions will occur over time in a predictable manner primarily through adjustments to reinvestments so that securities roll off our balance sheet.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"Over time, we intend to hold securities in the amounts needed for our ample- reserves operating framework, and in the longer run, we envision holding primarily Treasury securities."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,Our decisions to reduce our balance sheet will be guided by our maximum-employment and price-stability goals.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"In that regard, we will be prepared to adjust any of the details of our approach to balance sheet management in light of economic and financial developments."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"The Committee has not made decisions regarding the specific timing, pace, or other details of shrinking the balance sheet."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,And we will discuss these matters in upcoming meetings and provide additional information at the appropriate time.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"To conclude: We understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"[In] these high-level principles, [we] clarify that the federal funds rate is our primary means of adjusting monetary policy and that reducing our balance sheet will occur after the process of raising interest rates has begun."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"Specifically, the economy is now much stronger."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"There are—there are rules of thumb—I’m reluctant to land on one of them—that, that equate this."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s meant to be quite a general statement rather than a, a hint."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, I mean, I like to think that our, you know, our philosophy of the balance sheet is, is embodied in these principles."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, you know, the idea that, for example, the federal funds rate is the primary means of adjusting the stance of policy, that we’ll use—determine the timing and pace of reducing the size of the balance sheet to foster the dual mandate, that we’ll begin to reduce the size after we begin the process of raising rates, and on and on like that."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mean, that— those are all the things that, that try to describe how we will proceed."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"But maybe at a higher level, to try to get at your question: You know, asset purchases were, were enormously important at the beginning of the recovery in terms of restoring market function, as they were at—right after the—in the critical phase of the Global Financial Crisis."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"And then after [that], they were a macroeconomic tool to support demand."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"And now the economy no longer needs this, this highly accommodative policy that we put in place."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s all that’s saying.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"So it’s time to stop asset purchases first and then, at the appropriate time, start to shrink the balance sheet."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,We’ve identified the end state as—in amounts needed to implement monetary policy efficiently [and] effectively in the ample-reserves regime.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"So there’s a substantial amount of, of shrinkage in the balance sheet to be done."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s going to take some time.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,We want that process to be orderly and predictable.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"And so those are some of the ways that I would think this, this lays out our, you know, the way we—the way we’re thinking about this."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"In terms of the timing, I can’t really help you."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, it just says after, after we get under way."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"Now, the balance sheet is, is substantially larger than it needs to be."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we’re—I would say we are, we’re going to have another discussion at, at the next meeting."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"And it doesn’t mean we’re going to, but if the situation turns out to be different than we had thought, we’re not going to be—we’re not going to stick with something that isn’t working."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,It just—events required us to do so.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"And thank you, Mr. Chairman."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"Mr. Chairman, I have one sort of technical question and one question on principle."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"The technical question is, if, if you’re going to discuss balance sheet at the next upcoming meetings and you won’t begin balance sheet reduction until after you begin rate hikes, it seems to technically mean that you won’t or can’t begin balance sheet reduction until the summer."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,Is that correct?
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s the first thing.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"Second of all, you suggested that, that the—with balance sheet running in the background—that you would possibly be raising rates and running off the balance sheet at the same time."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s sort of the technical question part of it.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,So we got a pretty robust paragraph there that says we’re free to do this at any time.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"The principal question I have is, you said it’s going to be running in the background."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,So can you give us any sense of the discussion or staff presentation on what is the reaction function surrounding the balance sheet?
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,So let me—let me—let me start by talking about that last paragraph.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"So you’ll remember during the last cycle that this process of building up and then shrinking the balance sheet is a complicated one, and it involves, inevitably, surprises."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"And so during, during the years, during the prior cycle, we amended our balance sheet principles a number of times."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"Now, we didn’t intend to do that."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"But the statement on the balance sheet principles says “the Committee is prepared to adjust any of the details of its approach” based on “economic and financial developments,” which suggests there’s something of a reaction function associated to the balance sheet and it won’t be running in the background."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you, Michelle."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"And my guess is, we’ll have at least one other discussion at the meeting after that."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we’ll, you know, we’ll start the process of allowing runoff and shrinking the balance sheet at what we find to be the appropriate time."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,The Dallas Fed is not giving us the dates.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,And I don’t see why this is a matter for the inspector general or anybody else.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mean, why can’t he give us the dates?"
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,Will you help us get the dates of those transactions?
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,So you asked about the risks first.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,And Bloomberg asked for the dates of Mr. Kaplan’s transactions.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I—you know, the one risk is that inflation risks are still to the upside in the views of most FOMC participants and, certainly, in my view as well."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we don’t—we don’t think that’s the base case, but you asked what the risks are."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,And that’s—we have to be in a position with our monetary policy to address all of the plausible outcomes.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,And that calls for us to be in position.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"We, we have an expectation about the way the economy is going to be evolved, but we’ve got to be in a position to, to address different outcomes, including the one where inflation remains higher."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, we’ve been saying that what we need here is another long expansion, which is the kind of thing we saw over the last [one], which was a record long expansion."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,We saw labor force participation rise.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, again, we think of the balance sheet as, as moving in a predictable manner, sort of in the background, and that the active tool meeting to meeting is not both of them, it’s the federal funds rate."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"There’s a risk that, that the high inflation we’re seeing will be prolonged, and there’s a risk that it will move even higher."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, we’ll, we’ll tell you as we make progress."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"And next to those transactions, we’ll put dates."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, Robert Kaplan’s disclosure of his securities transactions—and in a couple of months, Chair Powell, or maybe sooner, you and I will file our tax returns."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s—I wish I could say more.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, honestly, we haven’t made those decisions."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we actually haven’t even really had the, the important discussions on a lot of the details that we will have at coming meetings."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,Let’s go to Craig Torres.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,CRAIG TORRES.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,And we’ll list transactions and all kinds of things.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"Chair Powell, Chair Powell."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,Craig Torres from Bloomberg.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"Chair Powell, at the beginning of the conversation, you said risks are two sided."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,And I’m wondering if you can elaborate on what are the risks to the elusive soft landing.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,Is Fed policy a risk?
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,Overtightening?
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,Or what are the risks?
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"And then second, Chair Powell, I have a quick administrative question."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"Good afternoon, Michelle and Chair Powell."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,STEVE LIESMAN.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"We saw wages persistently higher for people at the lower end, and there, there really was no obvious imbalance in the economy that threatened that expansion."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,[No response] Okay.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, as you know, the ultimate focus that we have is on the real economy: maximum employment and price stability."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,And financial conditions matter to the extent that they have implications for achieving the dual mandate.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"And you also know that we, we look at broader financial conditions, not one or two things, one or two markets."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"And what we’re always asking ourselves is, are we seeing changes that are both persistent and material enough that—of a change in financial conditions—that they are inconsistent with the achievement of our goals?"
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,So that’s how we’re looking at that.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I don’t want to comment on today’s financial conditions broadly, but we’re not looking at any one market or, or so."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,So that’s how we’re thinking.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"In terms of what we’ve seen, I would say this."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, it’s six weeks, seven weeks later now."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,And you have seen that our communication channel with the markets is working.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"Markets are, are now pricing in a number of rate increases."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"Surveys show that market participants are expecting a balance sheet runoff to begin, you know, at the appropriate time, sometime later this year perhaps."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,We haven’t made that decision yet.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we, we feel like the communications we have with market participants and with the general public are working and that financial conditions are reflecting in advance the decisions that we make."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,And monetary policy works significantly through expectations.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"We, you know, we said at our last meeting we published the Summary of Economic Projections, the median of which—the median participant expected three rate increases this year."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"So that, that in and of itself is appropriate."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"Conversely, to the degree that financial conditions have tightened some, might that be desirable in some ways in achieving your, your tightening goals?"
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,Glad to be back.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,Let’s go to Steve Liesman.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think we have a much better sense, frankly, of how rate increases affect financial conditions and, hence, economic conditions."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"Balance sheet [policy] is, is still a relatively new thing for, for the markets and for us, so we’re less certain about that."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, again, our—I think our—the pattern we’ll follow is to—is to arrive at a, you know, a timing and a pace and composition and all those things and then announce that with advance notice, and, and it will—it will start in the background."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"And then we’ll look to have that just running in the background and have—and have the interest rates, again, be the active tool of monetary policy."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"That’s, that’s at least the plan."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"I can’t tell you much more about any of the— any of the very good issues about size, pace, composition, those sorts of things."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"Sir, I was wondering if the volatility we’ve seen in financial markets in the last few weeks strikes you as anything alarming or that might affect the trajectory of policy."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,But we’ll be turning to all of those at coming meetings.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,Now we’ll go to Neil Irwin.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,NEIL IRWIN.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you, Chair Powell."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s Neil Irwin from Axios.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,NICK TIMIRAOS.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"And—but there’s also an element of, of uncertainty around the balance sheet."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,Let’s go to Howard Schneider.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think the path is highly uncertain and that we’re committed to using our tools to make sure that inflation, high inflation that we’re seeing, does not become entrenched."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"So a number of factors would be—it’s not just monetary policy—a number of factors are supporting a decline in inflation, as I mentioned."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,Fiscal policy will be—will provide significantly less of an impulse to growth.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"We do expect this year—although we do expect now that it will come slower than, than we had expected and hoped—that there will be relief on the supply side."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"So that, too, should—should lower the supply-side barriers, which are a big part of the story of why inflation is high."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"In addition, monetary policy will be becoming significantly less accommodative."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"There’s a case that, for whatever reason, the economy slows more and inflation slows more than expected; we’ll react to that."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"If, instead, we see inflation at a higher level or a more persistent level, then we’ll react to that."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,HOWARD SCHNEIDER.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,Let’s go to Jeanna Smialek.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,Let’s go to Jeanna.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, again, we’re, we’re well aware that this is a different economy than—than existed during the last tightening cycle, and our policy is going to reflect those differences."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"Given developments since then, do you still think that’s a credible narrative for the ultimate path of policy?"
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"So the question is—you know, we’ll, we’ll be asking this question all year long, and that will be, are things turning out as we expect?"
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,HOWARD SCHNEIDER.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"If I could follow just on a related question, the December SEPs had this copacetic sort of set of circumstances where inflation comes down without the federal funds rate ever getting over the estimate of neutral."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, for a year or so—Hi."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thanks, Chair Powell."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,Howard Schneider with Reuters.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"So for a year now, the statements referenced the benchmarks for this initial interest rate increase."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"I know you can’t stipulate the path, but how should we think about the criteria for the next step and the next step?"
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"Well, you’re right."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"Now that we’re approaching that moment, what are the benchmarks going to be for subsequent rate increases?"
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,HOWARD SCHNEIDER.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"We haven’t made a decision yet, and we’ll make that decision at the March meeting."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,We’ll make a decision whether to raise the federal funds rate.
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"I would say that the Committee is, is of a mind to, to raise the federal funds rate at the March meeting, assuming that conditions are appropriate for doing so."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"We have—we have our eyes on, on the risks, particularly around the world."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"But we do expect some softening in the economy from Omicron, but we think that that should be temporary."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we think that the economy should—the underlying strength of the economy should, you know, should, should—show through fairly quickly after that."
2022-01-26,Press Conf - Full Text,We haven’t got—we haven’t gotten to that point yet.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,But it’ll be faster than the last time.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, of course, it’s much sooner in a cycle than last time."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,But it will look familiar to you.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I would also say that there’ll be—I’m sure there’ll be a more detailed discussion of our—in the minutes to our meeting that come out in three weeks, where I expect that it will lay out, you know, pretty much the parameters of what we’re looking at, which I think will look quite familiar."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Let’s go to Michael McKee at Bloomberg TV.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Yes.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Mr. Chairman, since September of 2020, you’ve been operating on a monetary policy framework that let the economy run hot to bring unemployment down."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,That seems to be over.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,But I’m wondering how you would describe your reaction function now.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,What is it that the Fed is trying to do other than bring inflation down?
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"In other words, is it, we’re going to keep raising rates until it comes down to an acceptable level?"
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,But the framework is going to look very familiar to people who are familiar with the last time we did this.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHAEL MCKEE.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"I don’t want to get too much into the details, because we’re literally just finalizing them."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,JEAN YUNG.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,So all of that will go into the thinking of the timing around this.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we need to focus on price stability particularly, because the labor market is so strong and the economy is so strong."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Chair Powell."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,I wanted to ask about the balance sheet discussion you had at this meeting.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Can you give us any more details?
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Did you discuss whether to cap runoffs or whether to increase those caps over what period, if there were any details?"
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Yes.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,In terms of the—I would say this.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you for asking.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,And I’d say we’re now in a position to finalize and implement that plan so that we’ll actually begin a runoff at a coming meeting.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,And that could come as soon as our next meeting in May.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s not a decision that we’ve made.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,But I would say that that’s how well our discussions went in the last two days.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,So a couple things just to add.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’ll be mindful of the broader financial and economic context when we make the decision on timing, and we always want to use our tools to support macroeconomic and financial stability."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,We want to avoid adding uncertainty to what’s a highly uncertain situation already.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, at our meeting today and yesterday, we made excellent progress toward agreeing on the parameters of a plan to shrink the balance sheet."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,So I want to clear one thing up again.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Yes, there are threats to growth from, you know, from what’s going on in Eastern Europe."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"What we said in the framework changes was—and this was really a reflection of what had happened for the preceding couple of decades, actually."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And you see that, I think, in the Summary of Economic Projections."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And you see that in the decision we make, and you’ll continue to see it in the decisions we make, going forward."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHAEL MCKEE.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"If I could follow up by asking—I guess what you’d call it is the “Paul Volcker” question: You don’t think unemployment is going to rise significantly, but, if it does, does that temper your desire to keep raising rates?"
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"The goal, of course, is to restore price stability while also sustaining a strong labor market."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"We have a dual mandate, and they’re sort of equal."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And so we’re looking now to using our tools to restore price stability, and we’re committed to doing that."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, as I said earlier, you know, price stability is an essential goal."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"We saw the benefits of a long expansion, a sustained labor market."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"It pulled people back in, and there were really no imbalances in the economy that threatened the long expansion."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"It, just, the pandemic arrived; it was just a completely exogenous event."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,So that’s how we’re thinking about it.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"We, of course, want to achieve, you know, price stability with a strong labor market."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"But we do understand also that, really, you can’t have maximum employment for any sustained period without price stability."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,And now we’ll go to Jean Yung.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"In fact, it’s a precondition, really, for achieving the kind of labor market that we want, which is a strong and sustained labor market."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,And that is that nothing in our new framework or in the changes that we made has caused us to wait longer to raise interest rates.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, the help we’ve been expecting and other forecasters have been expecting from supply-side improvement, labor force participation, bottlenecks, all those things getting better—it hasn’t come."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, but, nonetheless, in the base case, there’s a pretty broad expectation of strong growth."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"What we said was, if we see, you know, low unemployment, high employment, but we don’t see inflation, then we’re not going to raise rates ’til we actually see inflation."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"That’s what we said, and that was the sense of it."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"There was no sense in which, if we got a burst of really high inflation, we would wait to raise rates."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s simply not in the framework.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"In fact, quite the contrary."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,The framework is all about anchoring inflation expectations at 2 percent.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I do hear this, you know, that the framework—really, we can’t blame the framework."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,But inflation is far above our target.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"It was a sudden, unexpected burst of inflation."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,But it was not in any way caused by or related to the framework.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, come to today."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, I think our vision on this on the Committee is very, very clear."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,What we see is a strong labor market.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"We see a labor market with a lot of momentum, great job creation."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,And we see the underlying economy’s strong.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Balance sheets are strong.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And then it was the reaction to it, and it was what it was."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,You might go there for the audio.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s a good thing for people.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Just a little housekeeping note: Those of you in this call may be having some tech issues.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,We have seen some gains in the prime-age workforce in the last few months.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,I wonder what you anticipate when it comes to some of the older workers as the health outlook has changed.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Are we going to see more recent retirees following Tom Brady back into the workforce?
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,And what would that mean for wages and inflation?
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s hard to say.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, what we saw in the last cycle was that, over the course of a long, steady expansion, labor force participation outperformed expectations."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,But I have a follow-up question on the labor force.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And that was just a, you know, it was a tight labor market, but it wasn’t—it was nowhere near as tight as this labor market."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,It wasn’t so much people coming back in the labor force after retirement.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"That’s not something that happens, in the aggregate, very much."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, so that’s what was happening."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, more labor force participation is tremendously welcome."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, of course, our policy does not in any way preclude that."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,This is a situation where wages have moved up at the highest rate in a very long time.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,And people are able to quit their jobs and move to better-paying jobs in the same industry or different industries.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"But it was a tight labor market, and so people stayed in the labor force longer."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,So it’s a really attractive labor market for people.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,I think I missed some of your answer there.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I apologize if this covers some of the same ground you just talked about, Mr."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,We feel like the economy can handle tighter monetary policy.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So that’s really the thinking there, is, you know, these are fairly well-understood channels, interest sensitive."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, basically, across the economy, we’d like to slow demand so that it’s better aligned with supply; give supply, at the same time, time to recover; and get into a better, you know, a better alignment of supply and demand."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And that, over time, should bring inflation down."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I’ll say again, though, you know, we don’t have a perfect crystal ball about the future, and we’re prepared to use our tools as needed to restore price stability."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, as I mentioned in my opening remarks, without price stability, there—you really can’t have a sustained period of maximum employment."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s our—one of our most fundamental obligations is to maintain and restore, in this case, price stability."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Chair.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,So we’re very committed to that.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"That is our intention, and we believe we can do that."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,But we have to restore price stability.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Okay.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Let’s go to Scott Horsley at NPR.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,SCOTT HORSLEY.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Of course, the plan is to restore price stability while also sustaining a strong labor market."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"If so, I understand the broadcast is coming through clearly on www.federalreserve.gov."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And once, you know, as we get past COVID well and truly, it becomes an even more attractive one."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s a good thing for the country.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And remember that the financial conditions we had for the last couple of years were a function not only of very aggressive, and appropriately so, fiscal policy, but also highly accommodative monetary policy—the monetary policy settings that we put in place at the worst parts of the pandemic."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,So it is very appropriate to move away from those.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, yes, that will lead to some tightening in financial conditions in the form of higher interest rates and just the sorts of things—we’re not targeting any one or more of those things, but financial conditions generally should move to a more normal level so that—because we know the economy no longer needs, or wants, these very highly accommodative, this stance, which, you know, so it’s time to move to a more normal setting of financial conditions, and we do that by moving monetary policy itself to more normal levels."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,RICH MILLER.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"When you say “move to a more normal setting” for financial conditions, that suggests to me that you want financial conditions to tighten further from where we are now."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Am I drawing the right inference from that?
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s how it reaches the real economy—by just the mechanisms you mentioned.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Well, yes."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, of course, when we tighten monetary policy, we do expect that they will adjust in sync over time with monetary policy."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s not any particular financial condition, but a broad range of financial conditions."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,They will reflect to some extent—they reflect any number of things.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, yes, we need our policy to transmit to the real economy."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And it does so through financial conditions, which means that, as we tighten policy or remove accommodation so that it’s at least less accommodative, that broader financial conditions will also be less accommodative."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I would say, we look at a broad range of financial conditions."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,So we hope that that will lead to more labor supply.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, as you know, policy works through financial conditions."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And it also will, we think, help relieve some of the wage pressures that do put inflation more at risk."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"That last part is, we’ll have to see whether, empirically, it winds up, works out that way."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, in principle, it ought to help with inflation as well."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s not the only thing we’re looking for, though, from inflation."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’re looking for help from a number of different places and, most importantly, from our own policy."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Okay.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Let’s go to Rich Miller at Bloomberg.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you, Michelle."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And thank you, Chair Powell."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,I’m sorry; I’m having some communication problems.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I missed some of the stuff you’ve said, and my apologies if this has been asked."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Since the FOMC met last January, financial conditions have tightened markedly, equity prices down, Treasury yield’s up, bond spread’s risen, yield curve has flattened a lot, and even further just today, dollar’s up."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Is that welcome?
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,And would you like to see more in order to achieve your goals?
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,RICH MILLER.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,They’re having a hard time hiring.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Let’s go to Brian Cheung at Yahoo.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,We don’t see that.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"You can see, for example, in some sectors that got very high wage increases early on, those wage increases looked like they may have slowed down to a normal level."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"But it comes back to, you know, what I’m saying here—which is, there’s a misalignment of demand and supply, particularly in the labor market."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,And that is leading to wages moving up at ways that are not consistent with 2 percent inflation over time.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And so we need to use our tools to, you know, guide inflation back down to 2 percent."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,And that would be in the context of an extraordinarily strong labor market.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"We think this labor market can handle, as I mentioned, tighter monetary policy."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,And the overall economy can as well.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, yes, wages are moving up faster than is consistent with 2 percent inflation, but it’s good to see that moving up."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,But it wouldn’t be sustainable over too long of a period to see them moving up that much higher.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,And that’s because of this misalignment between supply and demand.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,We expect to get more labor supply.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,We did last time.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,We got more than we expected during the last cycle.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"This time, we’ve gotten much less than expected."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And that’s really, I think, the sense of your question about a wage–price spiral; is that something that’s going to start happening and become entrenched in the system?"
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s very hard to say.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,And that may be—we don’t know how persistent that phenomenon will be.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"But right now, they’re all showing the same thing, which is that the increases—not the levels, but the increases—are running at levels that are well above what would be consistent with 2 percent inflation, our goal, over time."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,We have a very specific mandate.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And these are really the province of elected governments, as I mentioned."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,So I’d have to leave it at that.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Sorry.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Let’s go to Nancy Marshall-Genzer at Marketplace.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,So it’s not easy to predict these things.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks for taking the question.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"You’ve been talking a lot about rising wages, which, on the one hand, is a great thing, but are we possibly seeing the beginning of a wage–price spiral?"
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So the way I would say it is this: We, first of all, I would agree with the premise that wages moving up is a great thing."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, that’s how the standard of living rises over time."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, generally, it’s driven over long periods by rising productivity."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"But what we have now, if you look at these, the wage increases that we have, we look at a—we’re blessed with a range of measures of wages that all measure different things."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Chair Powell."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"But we do expect that we’ll get people coming back in the labor market, particularly as COVID becomes less and less of a factor in many people’s lives, something we all wish."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, so that’s how we think about it."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And what I saw today was a Committee that is strongly committed to achieving price stability, in particular, and prepared to use our tools to do that."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,We’re not going to let high inflation become entrenched.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,The costs of that would be too high.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,And we’re not going to wait so long that we have to do that.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"No one wants to have to really put restrictive monetary policy on, in order to get inflation back down."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, frankly, the need is one of getting back up, getting rates back up to more neutral levels as quickly as we practicably can and then moving beyond that, if that turns out to be appropriate."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, as you can see, it is appropriate in the sense that, [in] people’s [contributions to the] SEPs, they do write down levels of interest rates that are above their estimate of the longer-run neutral rate."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,We’re acutely aware of the need to restore price stability while keeping a strong labor market.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And there’s also a range of estimates, too, as you will see if you look at the details of the SEP."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Okay.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you all.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thanks, Mr."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Chair.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,But thanks for your question.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And so I’m reluctant to comment on sanctions really much because, again, they’re not for us [to decide]."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, we are, we have our tools—powerful tools—and the Committee is very focused on using them."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, again, we don’t have that luxury."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"For the last question, we’ll go to Don Lee at the L.A. Times."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,DON LEE.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Chair Powell."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think you said to the Senate earlier this month that, in hindsight, the Fed should have moved earlier."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,And it sounds like today that you don’t think that the Fed is late.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, just wanted to get your clarification on that."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And then, so, but that’s a separate question from your other question, which is “behind the curve.” And, you know, I don’t have the luxury of looking at it that way."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And if it is, if you still think that the Fed is “behind the curve,” how much “behind the curve” is it?"
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Right.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,So we are not—we don’t have the luxury of 20/20 hindsight in actually implementing real-time decisions in the world.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, you know, so the question is—the right question is, did you make the right decisions based on what you knew at the time?"
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"But that’s not the question I was answering, which is knowing what you know now."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I think if we knew now—of course, if we knew now that these supply blockages, really, and the inflation resulting from them in collision with, you know, very strong demand, if we knew that that was what was going to happen, then in hindsight, yes."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,It would have been appropriate to move earlier.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Obviously, it would be."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’re there to provide technical expertise, but they’re not, it’s not our decisions."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So the Administration and the Treasury Department, in particular, and other agencies—they create these sanctions."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"But let me say this: Sanctions are really the business of the elected government, and that’s true everywhere."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s our plan.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Let’s go to Jo Ling Kent at NBC News.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,JO LING KENT.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Chair Powell."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you so much for taking my question during this today.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,And that brings—that will bring inflation down over time.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,My question is a follow-up to what Brian just asked.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Well, that is—yes, indeed."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mean, as I just said, you know, I think we do understand very much, and we very much take to heart, that it’s our obligation to restore price stability."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, we’ve had price stability for a very long time and maybe come to take it for granted."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,But now we see the pain.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,I’m old enough to remember what very high inflation was like.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, we’re strongly committed as a Committee to not allowing this higher inflation to become entrenched and to use our tools to bring inflation back down to more normal levels, which—our target is 2 percent inflation."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,What is your message to consumers out there who can no longer afford the basics due to this high inflation?
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,So we will do that.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And so what we would see is demand slowing down, but just enough so that it’s better matched with supply."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,You asked about rates.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,BRIAN CHEUNG.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Chair Powell."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Hopefully no tech issues here on this front.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Wanted to ask just kind of the broad question about how you are communicating what the Fed’s doing here today to the average American who might not be reading the dot plots or understanding what the SEP is.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,How is the 25 basis point hike today and then the signaling on future Fed policy going to address the inflation that they’re feeling at the stores on a daily basis?
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Sure.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So the way that works, I would explain, is, as we raise interest rates, that should gradually slow down demand for the interest-sensitive parts of the economy."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,So I guess I’d start by just assuring everyone that we’re fully committed to bringing inflation back down and also sustaining the economic expansion.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, really, high inflation takes a toll on everyone."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"But it’s really, especially, on people who use most of their income to buy essentials like food, housing, and transportation, where—I mean, we’ve all seen charts that show, if you’re a middle-income person, you’ve got room to absorb some inflation."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"If you’re at the lower end of the income spectrum, it’s very hard because you’re spending most of your money already on necessities, and the price is going up."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,But it’s punishing for everyone.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,So it has been a difficult time for the economy.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"But we do anticipate that inflation will move back down, as I mentioned earlier."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"It may take longer than we like, but I’m confident that we’ll use our tools to bring inflation down."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"We do understand that these higher prices, no matter what the source, have real effects on people’s well- being."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I just would want people to understand that, and that’s—but the way we do that is by raising interest rates and by shrinking our balance sheet."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"That will slow the economy, while also allowing the labor market to remain very strong."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,JO LING KENT.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Let’s go to Simon at the Economist.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,SIMON RABINOVITCH.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Hi.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,But we certainly are prepared to use our tools—and we will.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you, Michelle."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Sorry to take you away from inflation for one minute.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"May I ask about the sanctions on Russia and, specifically, the freezing of the central bank assets?"
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Of course, that raises a similar risk for other sovereigns around the world and their biggest companies, potentially."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Any concerns about, in the long term, how this might affect the dollar’s status as the preeminent global reserve currency?"
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And in the past couple of weeks, have you had to deliver any kinds of reassurance to other central bankers around the world?"
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Well, so, of course, central bankers around the world are generally very in favor of these sanctions."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you, Chair Powell."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And so financial conditions will become, at the margin, less supportive of various kinds of economic activity."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,There will be other factors helping that happen.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,And they—so we need to use our tools to move supply and demand back.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, the good news is, the economy and the labor market are quite strong."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And that means the economy, we think, can handle interest rate increases."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,JO LING KENT.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And as a quick follow-up to that, you know, obviously, the Federal Reserve walking this very complicated fine line, trying to avoid a recession."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"For the consumers out there who are worried about their jobs in a possible recession, what do you say to that?"
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Well, I, you know, I say that our intention is to bring inflation back down to 2 percent, while still sustaining a strong labor market and that the economy is very strong."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,And we don’t think we need to do this alone.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"If you look at where forecasts are, people are forecasting growth that’s strong within the context of U.S. potential economic output."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And to the extent the data come in different, then, of course, our policy will adapt."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"But we do believe that our policy is the appropriate one for this forecast, and we believe that we can bring down inflation."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,We believe that we can do so while sustaining a strong labor market.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,The labor market is—it’s not strong in the ordinary sense of the word.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"We have not seen a labor market where there are 1.7 job openings for every unemployed person or where there, if you add job openings to those who are employed, that’s actually substantially a larger number than the size of the workforce, than the number of people who actually count themselves as in the workforce."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,So this is a situation where demand is higher than supply.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And when that happens, prices go up."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,So—and we expect that to continue.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,We’re hearing from companies that they can’t hire enough people.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"We have expected services inflation to move back up to where it was, and that’s part of what’s happening is, in the case of some services, prices are still getting back up to where they were before the crisis."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So it would actually, if you were just moving down the number of job openings so that they were more like one to one, you would have less upward pressure on wages."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Let’s go to Rachel at the Washington Post.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,RACHEL SIEGEL.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you, Michelle."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And thank you, Chair Powell, for taking our questions."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"I’m curious if you can be specific on when you expect to see inflation will start to come down, especially with the combination of rates going up, fiscal aid dissipating from the economy, and supply chains getting better?"
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And if you don’t start to see that, how will you signal it?"
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,What will you be looking for?
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,And what will you be looking for over the course of the year?
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,So I guess I would say that at the—before the invasion of Ukraine by Russia—so let’s go back to that.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"I would have said that the expectation was that inflation would peak sometime in the first quarter, maybe the end of the first quarter of this year, and then maybe stay at that level or a little bit lower and then start to come down in the back half of the year."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,HOWARD SCHNEIDER.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"I can’t be perfectly specific about it, but that’s certainly a possibility as we go through the year."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And if we do conclude that it would be appropriate to move more quickly to remove accommodation, then we’ll do so."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,And we’re going to be looking at evolving conditions.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"I don’t think that’s a big piece of it, actually."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think some of that is just an early assessment of the effects of spillovers from the war in Eastern Europe, which will hit our economy through a number of channels."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Highly uncertain, but, you know, you’re looking at higher oil prices, higher commodity prices."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,It’ll be—we think that will weigh on GDP to some extent.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,So that’s part of what moved those assessments down.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"I don’t think—I mean, I think, generally, monetary policy works with a lag, so some of that would also be in there."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"But remember, as well, that 2.8 percent is still very strong growth."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So now we’re, you know, we’re getting—we’re going—we’re already seeing a little bit of short- term upward pressure in inflation due to higher oil prices, natural gas [prices] a little bit but not so much for us since we have our own natural gas supply, other commodities prices."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"If we think that the potential growth rate of the economy is somewhere between, somewhere around 1.75 percent, 2.8 percent is strong economic growth."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, while it’s lower than last year’s 5.8 percent, it’s still quite strong growth."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,So I would say it’s quite a strong forecast.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,HOWARD SCHNEIDER.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, in that context, what would trigger you to go faster or slower on the rate hikes?"
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,“Ongoing increases” doesn’t really tell us whether this is going to come in bigger chunks or evenly paced through the year.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, you know, the way we’re thinking about this is that every meeting is a live meeting."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"It would have been one of the strongest years, in fact, of the last expansion."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"The other thing is that you’re seeing supply chain issues around shipping and around, you know, lots of countries and companies and people not wanting to touch Russian goods."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,So that’s going to mean more tangled supply chains.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,So that could actually push out [in time] the relief we were expecting on supply chains generally.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"I would say, if you look at the SEP, you’ve got people getting close to or even above, in many cases, their estimate of the longer-run neutral rate."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,So I understand that doesn’t do it for real rates.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"But if you go out a year or two, many people are, in their forecasts, are having tight policy from a real interest rate standpoint."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,So that’s something that we’re focused on.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Of course, it’s a highly uncertain environment."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, we don’t know what’s going to happen."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,But we do know that we’re going to deploy our tools to achieve our goals—and that includes the price-stability goal.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,You couched it in terms of real rates.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,VICTORIA GUIDA.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Chair Powell."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, looking at the Summary of Economic Projections, you all have inflation coming down over the course of the year to 4.3 percent."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And then you also have rates going up to what appears to still be below roughly what would be estimated to be the neutral rate, although I know that’s a little bit uncertain."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I was just wondering, how much of inflation coming down do you see as actually being as a result of the Fed itself raising rates?"
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And then also, if I could just ask, given that Sarah Bloom Raskin withdrew her nomination, what do you expect to do with the regulatory portfolio?"
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Do you expect to assign a Governor in charge of that?
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Let’s go to Victoria at Politico.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I just wanted to say that as I looked around the table at today’s meeting, I saw a Committee that’s acutely aware of the need to return the economy to price stability and [is] determined to use our tools to do exactly that."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,We expect growth to continue.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,So I guess I would say that the expectation is still that inflation will begin to come down in the second half of the year.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"But if you look at where I read the SEP headline median, we still expect inflation to be high this year, lower than last year, and then we expect—though, particularly with the effects of the war, but also the data we’ve seen so far this year—we expect inflation to remain high through the middle of the year, begin to come down, and then come down more sharply next year."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Let’s go to Nick at the Wall Street Journal.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,NICK TIMIRAOS.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Chair Powell, over the last six months, the Fed has shifted its policy stance quite a bit."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,As I—it’s clearly time to raise interest rates and begin the balance sheet shrinkage.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Six months ago, you were still buying assets."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And yet, despite the shift over the last six months, real rates are as negative today as they were then."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,So how concerned are you that further inflation surprises will offset the effects of recent policy firming by leading real rates to stay at levels that do not actually provide much restraint to the economy?
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So that’s one of many ways of capturing the situation, which is that we—the Committee really does understand that the time for rate increases and for shrinking the balance sheet has come."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I would just say, I would go back to “the economy is very strong,” as I mentioned."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Tremendous momentum in the labor market.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Most officials weren’t projecting any interest rate increases this year.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"You talk about monetary policy operating with a lag, but is this going to bite quicker than expected?"
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"I’m wondering, how much of that do you feel is the result of the Fed’s stiffer-than-expected action here?"
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"I was wondering, in the SEPs, you have quite a markdown to GDP from 4 to 2.8 percent."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Inflation remains well above our longer-run goal of 2 percent.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Aggregate demand is strong, and bottlenecks and supply constraints are limiting how quickly production can respond."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"These supply disruptions have been larger, and longer lasting, than anticipated, exacerbated by waves of the virus here and abroad, and price pressures have spread to a broader range of goods and services."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Additionally, higher energy prices are driving up overall inflation."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,The surge in prices of crude oil and other commodities that resulted from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine will put additional upward pressure on near-term inflation here at home.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"We understand that high inflation imposes significant hardship, especially on those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,We know that the best thing we can do to support a strong labor market is to promote a long expansion—and that is only possible in an environment of price stability.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"FOMC participants expect the labor market to remain strong, with the median projection for the unemployment rate declining to 3.5 percent by the end of this year and remaining near that level thereafter."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"As we emphasize in our policy statement, with appropriate firming in the stance of monetary policy, we expect inflation to return to 2 percent while the labor market remains strong."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"The median inflation projection of FOMC participants is 4.3 percent this year and falls to 2.7 percent next year and 2.3 percent in 2024; this trajectory is notably higher than projected in December, and participants continue to see risks as weighted to the upside."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,The Fed’s monetary policy actions have been guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Our policy has been adapting to the evolving economic environment, and it will continue to do so."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"As I noted, the Committee raised the target range for the federal funds rate by ¼ percentage point and anticipates that ongoing increases in the target range will be appropriate."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,The median projection for the appropriate level of the federal funds rate is 1.9 percent at the end of this year—a full percentage point higher than projected in December.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Over the following two years, the median projection is 2.8 percent—somewhat higher than the median estimate of its longer-run value."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Of course, these projections do not represent a Committee decision or plan, and no one knows with any certainty where the economy will be a year or more from now."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"That said, inflation is likely to take longer to return to our price-stability goal than previously expected."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Reducing the size of our balance sheet will also play an important role in firming the stance of monetary policy.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"As a result, employers are having difficulties filling job openings, and wages are rising at their fastest pace in many years."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"The improvements in labor market conditions have been widespread, including for workers at the lower end of the wage distribution as well as for African Americans and Hispanics."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Transcript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference March 16, 2022 CHAIR POWELL."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Good afternoon.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,I want to begin by acknowledging the tremendous hardship the Ukrainian people are suffering as a result of Russia’s invasion.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,The human toll is tragic.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,The financial and economic implications for the global economy and the U.S. economy are highly uncertain.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"At the Federal Reserve, we are strongly committed to achieving the monetary policy goals that Congress has given us: maximum employment and price stability."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Today, in support of these goals, the FOMC raised its policy interest rate by ¼ percentage point."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Labor demand is very strong, and while labor force participation has increased somewhat, labor supply remains subdued."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"The economy is very strong, and against the backdrop of an extremely tight labor market and high inflation, the Committee anticipates that ongoing increases in the target range for the federal funds rate will be appropriate."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Economic activity expanded at a robust 5½ percent pace last year, reflecting progress on vaccinations and the reopening of the economy, fiscal and monetary policy support, and the healthy financial positions of households and businesses."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,The rapid spread of the Omicron variant led to some slowing in economic activity early this year.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"But cases have declined sharply since mid-January, and the slowdown seems to have been mild and brief."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Although the invasion of Ukraine and related events represent a downside risk to the outlook for economic activity, FOMC participants continue to foresee solid growth."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"As shown in our Summary of Economic Projections, the median projection for real GDP growth stands at 2.8 percent this year, 2.2 percent next year, and 2 percent in 2024."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,The labor market has continued to strengthen and is extremely tight.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Over the first two months of the year, employment rose by more than a million jobs."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"In addition, we expect to begin reducing the size of our balance sheet at a coming meeting."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"At our meeting that wrapped up today, the Committee made good progress on a plan for reducing our securities holdings, and we expect to announce the beginning of balance sheet reduction at a coming meeting."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"As we noted in our policy statement, the implications of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine for the U.S. economy are highly uncertain."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I guess I would start by saying that, in my view, the probability of a recession within the next year is not particularly elevated."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,And why do I say that?
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Aggregate demand is currently strong, and most forecasters expect it to remain so."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"If you look at the labor market, [you find that it is] also very strong."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Conditions are tight, and payroll job growth is continuing at very high levels."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Household and business balance sheets are strong.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And so all signs are that this is a strong economy and, indeed, one that will be able to flourish—not to say withstand, but certainly flourish—as well in the face of less accommodative monetary policy."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"I wonder if you could detail your thinking a little bit about how you’re considering the, you know, the risks of going too fast and potentially tipping the economy into recession and how you’re weighing those risks against the possibility of going too slowly, allowing inflation to become embedded, and kind of getting “behind the curve.” CHAIR POWELL."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,So I guess that’s how I would say I’m looking at that.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,And that is our overall objective.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,But we do feel the economy is very strong and well positioned to withstand tighter monetary policy.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Let’s go to Howard at Reuters.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,HOWARD SCHNEIDER.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Chair Powell."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Of course, the objective is to achieve price stability while also sustaining a strong labor market."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"In making decisions about interest rates and the balance sheet, we will be mindful of the broader context in markets and in the economy, and we will use our tools to support financial and macroeconomic stability."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you so much for taking our questions.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,JEANNA SMIALEK.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"In addition to the direct effects from higher global oil and commodity prices, the invasion and related events may restrain economic activity abroad and further disrupt supply chains—which would create spillovers to the U.S. economy through trade and other channels."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"The volatility in financial markets, particularly if sustained, could also act to tighten credit conditions and affect the real economy."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Making appropriate monetary policy in this environment requires a recognition that the economy often evolves in unexpected ways.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,We will need to be nimble in responding to incoming data and the evolving outlook.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,And we will strive to avoid adding uncertainty to what is already an extraordinarily challenging and uncertain moment.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,We are attentive to the risks of potential further upward pressure on inflation and inflation expectations.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,The Committee is determined to take the measures necessary to restore price stability.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Chair Powell."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,The American economy is very strong and well positioned to handle tighter monetary policy.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Everything we do is in service to our public mission.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum-employment and price-stability goals.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,I look forward to your questions.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Let’s go to Jeanna at the New York Times.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"To conclude, we understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Okay, sorry."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"In February, the unemployment rate hit a post-pandemic low of 3.8 percent, a bit below the median of Committee participants’ estimates of its longer-run normal level."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,VICTORIA GUIDA.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"In other cases, it’s pretty clear that inflation has spread more broadly across services."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, yes, that is concerning."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"In the meanwhile, we see some progress on the good side."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, really, in this latest report, it was confined to vehicles, which is, admittedly, a large category."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, you know, as I mentioned, the Committee acutely feels its obligation to move to make sure that we restore price stability and is determined to use its tools to do so."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Let’s go to Steve Liesman at CNBC.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,STEVE LIESMAN.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Mr. Chairman, I wonder if you can help me understand the kind of logic, if there is one, in the SEP here."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"As I look at the median forecast, for example, for unemployment, it runs for the three-year window below the long-run rate."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"I look at inflation being above, over the three-year window, the long-run—or call it the neutral—rate, so the economy still runs hot."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,And that is all true in a regime when you run at least for two years the funds rate above the long-run rate.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"I guess my question is this: Are you not create—giving a forecast here that essentially suggests you will be continuing to run further “behind the curve”—and never really get in front of inflation, because the economy will continue to run hot?"
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"You would have a lot less of a labor shortage, which is going on pretty much across the economy."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,And it’s part of the overall picture.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we’re certainly, we noticed it in the last meeting."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, of course, that’s something we’re watching report by report."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"What impact has there been on your job, given the fact that [indaudible]— CHAIR POWELL."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,We lost you in the middle of the question.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Edward, can you repeat that question?"
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,EDWARD LAWRENCE.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"—the impact that—given you’re not actually confirmed and Governor Brainard is not actually confirmed, has there been any impact on your job or the Fed’s ability to handle inflation?"
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, kind of on a related issue: You said earlier [that] inflation will take longer to return to price stability than we had originally expected."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,None whatsoever.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Okay, let’s go to Colby Smith at the FT. COLBY SMITH."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you, Michelle."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Chair Powell, how concerned is the Committee about the notable pickup in services inflation, which is perhaps less likely to self-correct?"
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,And to what extent does it alter both the Committee’s confidence that long-term inflation expectations will not de-anchor in the coming months as well as the balance of risks that the Fed may need to raise interest rates further above neutral than indicated in the dot plot?
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Isn’t that a choice you’re making?
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, if so, why are you making that choice to let inflation run above price stability longer than you’d like?"
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"But we’ll deal with what comes, whether it’s better or worse."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Let’s go to Chris Rugaber at the AP.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,CHRISTOPHER RUGABER.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Hi.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"This is a modal, or most likely, expectation."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mean, there are a lot of economists skeptical that you can reduce inflation as much as you’ve penciled in without raising the unemployment rate."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mean, outside housing and autos, how do higher fed [funds] rates reduce consumer demand unless it’s through higher unemployment?"
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Well, if you take a look at today’s labor market, what you have is 1.7-plus job openings for every unemployed person."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So that’s a very, very tight labor market— tight to an unhealthy level, I would say."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, in principle, if you were—let’s say that our tools work about as you described, and the idea is, we’re trying to better align demand and supply, let’s just say in the labor market."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Tell me again your first question.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I’m wondering, just what are the mechanisms you see in reducing demand?"
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And then just as a follow on that, I wanted to get you on the record on this."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And so we are determined on that front, and we’ll deal with what comes."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, the reality is, there are many, many moving pieces, and we don’t know what will actually happen."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Right.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So our, if you look, our—first of all, there is no—you’re looking at medians."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"But understand that there’s no, it’s not something we voted on."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s not a plan.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"But if you look, people do have their in—by the end of this year, broadly, people are at or close to or, in some cases, above their estimates of longer-run neutral interest rate."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Okay.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So that should stop pushing—that should, in other words, that should be a removal of accommodation for monetary policy, basically."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"But no matter what happens, this is a Committee that is determined to use its tools to make sure that higher inflation does not become entrenched."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"At the same time, we will have done significant balance sheet runoff."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"In the next year, and just looking at the median, you’re now above the, you know, above the, what people estimate to be the longer-run median."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And also, in many people’s forecasts, that actually amounts to, you know, tight policy under, in real rates as well."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,So why does unemployment remain at 3.5 percent?
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, it—I mean, a couple points."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"One is the connection between—in the economy we had before the pandemic, the connection between inflation and the level of the unemployment rate was not very tight."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"But this is—clearly, what this is is an expectation that, really it amounts to that, the idea that wage increases, which are now running above the level that would be consistent over the long run with 2 percent inflation, will move back down to levels which are still very attractive, full-economy kind of—full-employment kind of wages, but not to a point where they’re pushing up inflation anymore."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, as I mentioned, there are a lot of factors causing inflation to come down."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,And you can think of that as further.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,EDWARD LAWRENCE.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Well, let me follow up a bit on that."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, as I mentioned, if we conclude that it would be appropriate to move more quickly, we’ll do so."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So what’s happening is, things are coming to the full Board, and we’re voting on them."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,We’re getting our business done.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, we got the stress tests done."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’ve looked at, you know, a number of proposals for mergers and things like that."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,So we’re working ahead.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Of course, we don’t have a Vice Chair for Supervision, as you mentioned."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,But we’re making do with the situation we have.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,The committee is not active.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,And a good number of things have come straight to the Board for approval.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Let’s go to Neil Irwin at Axios.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,[Pause] Let’s go to Neil Irwin.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,NEIL IRWIN.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Chair Powell."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s Neil Irwin at Axios.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks for taking our questions.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"In the statement of economic projections, we see a forecast of median 1.9 percent fed funds rate at the end of the year, 2.8 end of next year."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Wondered whether that aligns with your own expectations, in particular on that point of overshooting the long-term neutral rate."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s what we’re doing.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So on the regulatory portfolio, I would just say this."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"My first question is, how much do you expect inflation to come down as a direct result of the Fed’s actions?"
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,I’ll leave it to others to make the judgment you asked for.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Okay.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So part of inflation coming down at the very beginning is clearly to do with factors other than our policy, and those would include, potentially, the supply chain is getting a little bit better, certainly base effects."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"You’re lapping—as you know, when you look at a 12-month trailing window, you’re lapping very high inflation in March, April, May, June of last year."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Really what we’re looking for, though, is month-by-month inflation coming down."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, we have an obligation to carry out under the law in supervision and regulation, and we’re doing that."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And so it’s really, it’s all the things we’ve been talking about, you know, that really haven’t helped much, including the shift away from goods and back to services, including supply chains getting better, including labor force participation—all those things that have been sticky and not happening."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, I think monetary policy starts to bite on inflation, and on growth, with a lag, of course."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,And so you would see that more in ’23 and ’24.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"But also, remember we started talking about rate increases last year."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"For some months now, financial conditions have already incorporated a significant number of rate increases."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,So it doesn’t start today.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"The effect, the moves are already priced into the market for a few months now."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So the clock is running on that, and I think some of that will be seen in the second half of the year as well."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"But a big part of it is, though, is the base effects I mentioned as well."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, also, if you can tell us anything about how that might be paced: front-loaded, back-loaded."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,So there should be some effects from that in the 12-month picture.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,We’re going to try one more time.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Colby Smith at the FT. [Long pause] Okay.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,We’ll come back to Colby.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Let’s go to Edward Lawrence.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,EDWARD LAWRENCE.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Yes.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you, Chair Powell."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,Okay.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you, Michelle, for the question."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"The last time the CPI inflation—I know you look at PCE, but CPI inflation—was as high as it is was July of 1981, when the effective federal funds rate was 19.2 percent."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"But given the current data, how far behind the curve of inflation do you believe the Federal Reserve is, in your mind?"
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, as you can see, we have a plan over the course of this year to raise interest rates steadily and also to run off the balance sheet."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,So I just would say a couple things.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"We have the tools that we need, and we’re going to use them."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"We will take the necessary steps to ensure that high inflation does not become entrenched, while also supporting a strong labor market."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,How high is the bar for doing 50 at one meeting?
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,I have a more basic question.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,[Long pause] One second.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And if we conclude that it would be appropriate to raise interest rates more quickly, then we’ll do so."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s in there, but I, you know, I think Fed Chairs have generally not done that, because we just haven’t done it."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s because we’re, you know, we have to put together the consensus on the Committee and present that consensus."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And in terms of the pacing of it, I would just point out that that is—there’s seven remaining meetings this year."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,This isn’t something we discuss or debate or agree on.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"But there’s seven remaining meetings, and there’s seven rate hikes."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"I would add there’s also the shrinkage of the balance sheet, which, you people do the math different ways, but that might be the equivalent of another rate increase just from the runoff of the balance sheet."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,So I don’t—but I don’t know.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,So I wouldn’t talk about my individual one.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,We haven’t made any decisions on front-end loading or going steadily through the year.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,And we’ll be going—each meeting is a live meeting.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,We’ll be looking at the inflation outlook and making a judgement.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,We’ll be looking to see whether the data show expected improvement on inflation.
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I don’t—Neil, I’ve never talked about my own SEP projection."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I can’t give you, I’m not going to try to give you a really specific test for what it would take to do that."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, as I mentioned, you know, if you look at the SEP, a good number of participants do see more than seven or eight increases this year."
2022-03-16,Press Conf - Full Text,"But I will say this, that we’ll be looking at the data as they come in."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,I shouldn’t be singled out in this respect.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,We can’t know that today.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,That decision is not in front of us today.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"If we do conclude that we need to do that, then we won’t hesitate to do it."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"I’ll say again, there’s no bright line, you know, that you’re stepping over."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,You’re really looking at what our policy stance is and what the market is forecasting for it.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,And I— But I would phrase it this way: He had the courage to do what he thought was the right thing.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, we won’t be arguing about whose model of the neutral rate is better than the other one."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s much more about a practical application of our policy tools.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,But I knew him just a little bit and have tremendous admiration for him.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,It—wouldn’t hesitate if that’s what it takes.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I am, of course—who isn’t an admirer of Paul Volcker?"
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,So I think it’s certainly possible that we’ll need to move policy to levels that we see as restrictive as opposed to just neutral.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,You’re looking at financial conditions and how that’s affecting the economy and making a judgment.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,And we’re absolutely prepared to do that.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,Steve Matthews.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,And while it’s certainly not your desire—the soft landing is the big hope of everyone— would this FOMC have the courage to endure recessions to bring inflation down if that were the only way necessary?
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,We don’t have an oversight function there.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we look at it as our job, given all the factors that are happening, to try to sustain maximum employment and price stability."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"So if Congress or the Administration has ways to help with inflation, I would encourage that, but I’m not going to get into making recommendations or anything like that."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s not, it’s really not our role—we need to stay in our lane and do our job."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"When we get inflation back under control, then maybe I can, you know, give other people advice [laughter]."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"Right now, we need to focus on, just focus on doing our job."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,And I’ll stick to that.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,STEVE MATTHEWS.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,Steve Matthews with Bloomberg News.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,A number of your colleagues have said that the rates will need to go above neutral into a restrictive territory to bring down inflation.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"One, do you agree with that?"
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, two, you’ve recently spoken in great praise of Paul Volcker, who had the courage to bring inflation down with recessions in the 1980s."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,Stick in our lane.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s what it was.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"This is, we have a pandemic, we have the highest unemployment, you know, in—since the Depression."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,It was that he always did—he always did—what he thought was the right thing.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,So it’s been a series of inflationary shocks that are really different from anything people have seen in 40 years.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,So we have to look through that and look at the economy that’s coming out the other side.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,And we need to somehow find price stability out of this.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"And it’s obviously going to be very challenging, I think, because you do have, you know, numerous supply shocks, which are famously difficult to deal with."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,So I guess that’s how I think about it.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,And now we have these shutdowns in China.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,Chris Rugaber.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"Chris Rugaber, Associated Press."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"Earlier, you just said that if necessary—I think were the words—that you would, or if it, if it turned out to be necessary, or you said that it’s possible that we’ll need to move policy to restrictive levels."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we take whatever arrives at the Fed in terms of fiscal activity, we take it as a given, and we don’t evaluate it—it’s not our job, really."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"Given where inflation is and the hot economy is—or, certainly, the hot labor market, as you described it—why still the hesitation?"
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mean, what else do you need to see in order to determine that?"
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,CHRISTOPHER RUGABER.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,It wasn’t a particular thing.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"Then we have a war in Ukraine, which is cutting the commodity, you know, patch in half."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,Then we have this outsized response from fiscal policy and monetary policy.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"If you read his last autobiography, that really comes through."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,So that’s [what] the test is.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"It isn’t, will we do one particular thing?"
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"I would say, we do see, though—we see restoring price stability as absolutely essential for the country in coming years."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"Without price stability, the economy doesn’t work for anybody, really."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"And so it’s really essential, particularly for the labor market."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,Then we have inflation.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"If you think about it, like if you look at the last cycle, we had a very, very—longest expansion cycle in our recorded history."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"And it was, you know, racial, wealth, and income—not wealth, but income gaps were coming down, wage gaps."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,So it’s a really great thing.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,We’d all love to get back to that place.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"But to get back to anything like that place, you need price stability."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, basically, we’ve been hit by historically large inflationary shocks since the pandemic."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,This isn’t anything like regular business.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"In the last two, three years, you had the benefits of this tight labor market going to people in the lower quartiles."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, it’s really the Fed that has responsibility for price stability."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,Do you feel that the Fed has been supported enough from policies at the White House and in Congress in combating inflation?
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,So it’s not going to be pleasant either.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"But in the end, everyone is better off."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,Everyone— particularly people on fixed incomes and at the lower part of the income distribution are better off with stable prices.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,And so we need to do everything we can to restore stable prices.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,We’ll do it as quickly and effectively as we can.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"We think we have a good chance to do it without a significant increase in unemployment or, you know, a really sharp slowdown."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"Now, the process of getting there involves higher rates—so higher mortgage rates, higher borrowing rates, and things like that."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, ultimately, we think about the medium and longer term, and everyone will be better off if we can get this job done—the sooner, the better."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,Edward.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,EDWARD LAWRENCE.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you, Chair Powell."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,Edward Lawrence with the Fox Business Network.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,So you’ve talked in the past about consumer spending and how that drives the economy.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"Are you concerned, with this high level of inflation, that the consumer will stop spending—and what’s the level of your concern—pushing us into a recession?"
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"And the way we do that is, we try to get supply and demand back in sync with each other, back in balance, so that the economy is under less stress and inflation will go down."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"And it’s our job to make sure that inflation of that unpleasant, high nature doesn’t get entrenched in the economy."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,Rachel Siegel here from the Washington Post.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,Wouldn’t the Fed naturally be looking to go to a restrictive level at this point?
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"To follow up from your message from the very beginning, what is your message to the American people about when they will start to feel the effects of, say, a 50-basis-point rate hike or multiple hikes?"
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,How do you explain to them what that does to their grocery bill or their rent or their gas bill?
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"That’s what we’re here for, one of the main things we’re here for—perhaps the most fundamental thing we’re here for."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, first, the first thing to say is that we understand."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,But it’s very unpleasant.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s just something people don’t—when they experience it for the first time, you’re paying more for the same thing."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"If you’re a normal economic person, then you probably don’t have that much extra to spend."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"And it’s immediately hitting your spending on groceries, on, you know, on gasoline, on energy, and things like that."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,So we understand the pain involved.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,So how do you get out of that?
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"And some of us are old enough to have lived through high inflation, and many aren’t."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,So the economy is doing fairly well.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we see, you know, household spending and business investment as fairly strong— and even in the first quarter, which was relatively slow on some other fronts."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,The issue will come that we don’t have precision surgical tools.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"We have, essentially, interest rates, the balance sheet, and forward guidance, and they’re famously blunt tools."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,They’re not capable of surgical precision.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,So I would agree.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"No one thinks this will be easy, no one thinks it’s straightforward, but there is certainly a plausible path to this, and I do think we’ve got a good chance to do that."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, our job is not to rate the chances—it is to try to achieve it."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"So there should be room, in principle, to reduce that surplus demand without putting people out of work."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,So that’s what we’re doing.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,Steve Dorsey.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,STEVE DORSEY.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"Steve Dorsey, CBS."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"You mentioned earlier, just now, fading fiscal policy."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"There are a range of opinions, though, and that’s only appropriate."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,We expect growth to be solid this year.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,Now you have surplus demand.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,Businesses can’t find the people to hire—they can’t find them.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, and the labor market—if you look at the labor market, for people who are out of work and looking, there are lots of job opportunities for—wages are moving up and at rates that haven’t been seen in quite a long time."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"So it’s a good time to be a worker looking to, you know, either change jobs or get a wage increase in your current job."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"So it’s a strong economy, and nothing about it suggests that it’s close to, or vulnerable to, a recession."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"Now, of course, given events around the world and fading fiscal policy effects and higher rates, you could see some slower economic activity."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"Certainly, it will not be—last year was an extraordinarily strong growth year as we recovered from the pandemic."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"As I mentioned, growth [was] over 5 percent."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, typically, in a recession, you would have unemployment."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"But most forecasters have growth this year at, you know, at a solid pace above 2 percent."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,But we’ve talked with economists who have advised Democrats and Republican Presidents who both said that the Fed is so far behind the curve on inflation that a recession is inevitable.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, and as I said, I think we have a good chance to restore price stability without a recession—without, you know, a severe downturn; without materially high, higher unemployment."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,And I mentioned the reasons for that.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,So I see a strong economy now.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"I see a very strong labor market, for example."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,EDWARD LAWRENCE.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mean, so, yes, there may be some pain associated with getting back to that."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I didn’t—if I said “necessary,” I meant to say “appropriate.” We’re not going to be erecting a high barrier for this."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"And that’s why I say—and I actually mentioned this at the March meeting—that no one should look at any single SEP as sort of a real resting place for 90 days, because we’re in a fast-evolving situation."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,And it’s clearly continuing.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,And that process is going on.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"We, you know—the Committee moved by the time of the December meeting to a median [in participants’ 2022 projections] of three rate increases, then to a median of seven increases at the March meeting."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"Ever since then, really ever since then, we’ve been adapting."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,And we have.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,And so I think it became clear to the Committee that we needed to adjust and adapt.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,Then we got a really high CPI report.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,Then we got a really strong jobs report.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"Anyway, we got an ECI reading—employment compensation, [employment cost] index reading—the Friday before the November meeting."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,But that hadn’t happened yet.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"And by the way—then, with the restatement of the jobs numbers, it looked like the job market was much more even and stronger in the second half of the year."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"And then around the end of October, we got three or four really strong readings that just said, no, this is a much stronger economy."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"And inflation—month by month, inflation had come down till September, a few months in a row, stayed low."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"If you remember, there were a couple of weak jobs reports."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, look, I think what you’ve seen is—really, I would say, in the middle of last fall—there was a time when our policy stance was still pretty much in sync with what the data were saying."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"Interest rates, you know—businesses will invest a little bit less, consumers will spend a little bit less."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s how it works.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, ultimately, getting those, getting supply and demand back, you know, back in balance, is what gives us 2 percent inflation, which is what gives the economy a footing where people can lead successful economic lives and not worry about inflation."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, you know, the big pain over time is in not dealing with inflation and allowing it to become entrenched."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,Greg Robb.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,And that’s what’s happened.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,GREG ROBB.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you, Chair Powell."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,Greg Robb from MarketWatch.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"I was wondering if you could take a step back and talk about, in March the dot plot had, you know, looked like steady quarter-point rate hikes, get the funds rate up to 2 percent at the end of the year."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,Now—where it seems like you’re much more aggressive.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,So could you talk about the thinking that’s behind that?
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"You can see— unanimous vote today, of course."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,And I told you the guidance—that broad support on the Committee to have 50-basis-point hikes on the table at the next couple of meetings.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,So you’re right.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, of course, everyone loves to see wages go up."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"And it’s a great thing, but you want them to go up at a sustainable level, because these wages are, to some extent, being eaten up by inflation."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, what that really means is, to get the kind of labor market we really want to get, we really want to have a labor market that serves all Americans, especially the people in the lower-income part of the distribution, especially them."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"To do that, you’ve got to have price stability."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we’ve got to get back to price stability so that we can have a labor market where people’s wages aren’t being eaten up by inflation and where we can have a long expansion, too."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"That’s—the good things you can have, as we have."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"And companies can’t hire, and wages are moving up at levels that would not, over time, be consistent with 2 percent inflation over time."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’ve had—several of the longest expansions in U.S. history have been in the last 40 years, and that’s because it’s been a time of low inflation."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,So that’s the way I think about it.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think we—you know, our tools work."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"We have to think in the, in the medium and longer term."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I do think that the best thing for everyone is for us to get back to price stability to support, really, a sustained period of strong labor market conditions."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks very much.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Chair Powell."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,And long expansions are good for people and good for the labor market.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"And so what our tools do is that as we raise interest rates, demand moderates: it moves down."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,There aren’t enough people to fill these job openings.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"I don’t, because you can see that the labor market is out of balance."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"And by the way, other forecasters have been doing the same thing."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,And it’s just us adapting to the data and to the situation and using our tools to deal with it.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,We’ll go to Nancy for the last question.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,You can see that there’s a labor shortage.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,Hi.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"Chair Powell, I want to ask how you’re able to balance your dual mandate—stable prices and maximum employment—especially when the unemployment rate for Black workers is still roughly double, roughly twice the rate for white workers."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,So unemployment rates for all racial groups have come down a lot and are now much closer to where they were before the pandemic hit.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,So that’s one thing I would say.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,And that’s important.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"But the bigger point is this: I do not, at this time, see the two sides of the mandate as in tension."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,Nancy Marshall-Genzer with Marketplace.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"And what you’re seeing as a result of that is prices going up and at unsustainable levels, levels that are not consistent with 2 percent inflation."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"Well, so, as I mentioned, you can see places where the demand is substantially in excess of supply."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"It was just, pick a date, you know, and that happened to be the date that we picked."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,It was—nothing magic about it.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, it’s not going to have any macroeconomic significance over time."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,We just picked that.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"Sometimes we publish these calendars on the first day of the month, and that’s what we’re doing."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,I wouldn’t read anything into it.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, why June 1?"
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"In terms of the effect, I mean, I would just stress how uncertain the effect is of shrinking the balance sheet."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, these are very uncertain."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,I really can’t be any clearer.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,There won’t be any clearer [estimates].
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, people estimate that, broadly, on the path we’re on—and this will be taken, probably, too seriously—but sort of ¼ percent, one rate increase over the course of a year at this pace."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"But I would just say, with very wide uncertainty bands—very wide."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,We don’t really know.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, we run these models—and everyone does in this field—and make estimates of what will be, how do you measure, you know, a certain quantum of balance sheet shrinkage compared to quantitative easing?"
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"There are other estimates that are much smaller than that, by the way."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"And then, finally, I’m just curious why you felt the need to address the American people at the top of your remarks?"
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s more, if we think it’s appropriate."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, the point is, we’re a very long way from neutral now."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’re moving there expeditiously, and we’ll continue to do so."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we can’t make that decision, really, today."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,The decision for about how high to go will be on the table to be made when we reach neutral.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, I expect we’ll get there expeditiously, as I’ve mentioned."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,Are you concerned about Fed credibility with the American people?
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,So it’s not that we don’t want to—making that decision today wouldn’t really mean anything.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,Michael McKee.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHAEL MCKEE.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,Mike McKee from Bloomberg Television and Radio.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"The balance sheet—why did you decide to wait until June 1st to begin letting securities roll off and not immediately start in the middle of this month, say?"
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"And do you have another, a newer or a better, estimate for the monetary policy impact of letting the balance sheet decline?"
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"But I’ll say again, if we do believe that it’s appropriate to go to those levels, we won’t hesitate."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,And some of you may read about that.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"We know that it is part of returning to more normal, more neutral financial conditions."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,And I think we want to keep it that way.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,Scott Horsley.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,[No response] Okay.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,Brian Cheung.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,BRIAN CHEUNG.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,And so that shows that the markets think that our forward guidance is credible.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,Hi there.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"To expand on Steve’s question about Paul Volcker, there was also a great pain that came with that as well—higher interest rates, obviously affecting households and businesses."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,I’m wondering how you kind of square what might be demand disruption.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,Are you already seeing that?
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"Is the idea here to incentivize a lack of spending, to decrease consumption, to perhaps table business investments?"
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,Is that essentially what’s happening through this hiking cycle?
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,Brian Cheung with Yahoo Finance.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s kind of a mainstream estimate.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,People are feeling those higher rates already.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"In September, I think it was at 20 basis points."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, our strategy is to set up a plan and have it operate and really have, you know, have the interest rate be the active tool of monetary policy."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"In terms of speaking to the American people, so I feel like sometimes I just want to remind us, really, that that’s who we work for, and that it’s inflation that people are feeling all over the country."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,And it’s very important that they know that we know how painful it is and that we are working hard on fixing it.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,I thought it was quite important to do that.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,And so that was really the thinking behind that.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHAEL MCKEE.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,And that’s all through the economy.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,Do you think the Fed has a credibility problem?
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"No, I don’t."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"And a good example of why would be—in the fourth quarter of last year, as we started talking about tapering sooner and then raising rates this year, you saw financial markets reacting, you know, very appropriately."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"Not to bless any particular day’s measure, but the way financial markets, the forward rate curve has tightened in response to our guidance and our actions really amplifies our policy."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s—monetary policy is working through expectations now, to a very large extent."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,We’ve only done two rate increases.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"But if you look at financial conditions, the two-year [rate] is at 280 [basis points] now."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,RACHEL SIEGEL.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,So there isn’t a specific number.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,And so it doesn’t seem to be anywhere close to a downturn.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"The labor market is, as I mentioned, very, very strong."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,Businesses are in good financial shape.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"You’re looking at, you know, excess savings on balance sheets—excess in the sense that they’re substantially larger than the prior trend."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"One is, households and businesses are in very strong financial shape."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,And I’ll give you a couple of reasons for that.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"Now, I would say, I think we have a good chance to have a soft or softish landing or outcome, if you will."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,So there’s a path to that.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"And that would give us a chance to get inflation down, get wages down, and then get inflation down without having to slow the economy and have a recession and have unemployment rise materially."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, in principle, it seems as though by moderating demand, we could see vacancies come down and, as a result—and they could come down fairly significantly and, I think, put supply and demand at least closer together than they are."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,We haven’t been at that sort of level of a ratio in the modern era.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we haven’t been in that place on the vacancy, sort of the vacancy/unemployed curve, the Beveridge curve."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"There’re 1.9 vacancies for every unemployed person, 11.5 million vacancies, 6 million unemployed people."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"There’s a path by which we would be able to have demand moderate in the labor market and therefore have vacancies come down without unemployment going up, because vacancies are at such an extraordinarily high level."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,So I guess I would say it this way: There’s a path.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,Your level of confidence that you can slow hiring without pushing the economy into a downturn.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"And that will, of course, tend to hold the unemployment rate up a little bit."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"I would also expect, though, that job creation will slow."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"Job creation has been, you know, more than half a million per month in recent months—very, very strong, particularly for this stage of the economy."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"And so we think— with fiscal policy less supportive, with monetary policy less supportive, we think that job creation will slow as well."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,So it is certainly possible that the unemployment would go down further.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,But so I would expect those to be relatively limited because of the additional supply and also just the slowing in job creation.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"Therefore, the economy is strong and is well positioned to handle tighter monetary policy."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"Implications for inflation—really, the wages matter a fair amount for companies, particularly in the service sector."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"And they are one good example, or good illustration, really, of how tight the labor market really is, the fact that wages are running at the highest level in many decades."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,And that’s because of an imbalance between supply and demand in the labor market.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we think through our policies—through further healing in the labor market, higher rates, for example, of vacancy filling and things like that, and more people coming back in—we’d like to think that supply and demand will come back into balance and that, therefore, wage inflation will moderate to still high levels of wage increases, but ones that are more consistent with 2 percent inflation."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s our expectation.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,Your third question was?
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,NICK TIMIRAOS.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"Wages are running high, the highest they’ve run in quite some time."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, but I’ll say, I do expect that this will be very challenging; it’s not going to be easy."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"And it may well depend, of course, on events that are not under our control."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"But our job is to use our tools to try to achieve that outcome, and that’s what we’re going to do."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we’ve said that, again, assuming that economic and financial conditions evolve in ways that are consistent with our expectations, there’s a broad sense on the Committee that additional 50- basis-point increases should be on the table for the next couple of meetings."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we’re going to make those decisions at the meetings, of course, and we’ll be paying close attention to the incoming data and the evolving outlook as well as to financial conditions."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, finally, of course, we will be communicating to the public about what our expectations will be as they evolve."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,So the test is really just as I laid it out—economic and financial conditions evolving broadly in line with expectations.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, I think expectations are that we’ll start to see inflation, you know, flattening out—and not necessarily declining yet, but we’ll see more evidence."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,We’ve seen some evidence that core PCE inflation is perhaps either reaching a peak or flattening out.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"What we are doing is, we raised [the funds rate by] 50 basis points today."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,We’ll want to know more than just some evidence.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we’re going to make these decisions, and there’ll be a lot more information."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,I just think we want to see that information as we get there.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s a very difficult environment to try to give forward guidance 60, 90 days in advance."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,There are just so many things that can happen in the economy and around the world.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, you know, we’re leaving ourselves room to look at the data and make a decision as we get there."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,STEVE LIESMAN.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,We’ll want to really feel like we’re making some progress there.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,We’ve seen that particularly among prime-age people.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,So a 75-basis-point increase is not something the Committee is actively considering.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,Steve.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,STEVE LIESMAN.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"Steve Liesman, CNBC."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thanks for taking my question, Mr. Chairman."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,You talked about using 50-basis-point rate hikes or the possibility of them in coming meetings.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,Sure.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,Might there be something larger than 50?
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,And perhaps you could walk us through your calibration.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,Why one month should—or one meeting should we expect a 50?
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,Why something bigger?
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,Why something smaller?
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,What is the reasoning for the level of the amount of tightening?
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,Is 75 or a percentage point possible?
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I would say that I expect, and Committee members generally expect, that we’ll get some additional participation."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,So you’re right—3.6 percent unemployment is just about as low as it’s been in 50 years.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"In March, the unemployment rate hit a post-pandemic, and near-five-decade, low of 3.6 percent."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"Improvements in labor market conditions have been widespread, including for workers at the lower end of the wage distribution as well as for African Americans and Hispanics."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"Labor demand is very strong, and, while labor force participation has increased somewhat, labor supply remains subdued."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"Employers are having difficulties filling job openings, and wages are rising at the fastest pace in many years."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,Inflation remains well above our longer-run goal of 2 percent.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"Over the 12 months ending in March, total PCE prices rose 6.6 percent; excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 5.2 percent."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"Over the first three months of the year, employment rose by nearly 1.7 million jobs."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"Aggregate demand is strong, and bottlenecks and supply constraints are limiting how quickly production can respond."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,The surge in prices of crude oil and other commodities that resulted from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is creating additional upward pressure on inflation.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,And COVID-related lockdowns in China are likely to further exacerbate supply chain disruptions as well.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is causing tremendous loss and hardship, and our thoughts and sympathies are with the people of Ukraine."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"Our job is to consider the implications for the U.S. economy, which remain highly uncertain."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"In addition to the effects on inflation, the invasion and related events are likely to restrain economic activity abroad and further disrupt supply chains, creating spillovers to the U.S. economy through trade and other channels."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,The Fed’s monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"Disruptions to supply have been larger, and longer lasting, than anticipated, and price pressures have spread to a broader range of goods and services."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"My colleagues and I are acutely aware that high inflation imposes significant hardship, especially on those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,The labor market has continued to strengthen and is extremely tight.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"Underlying momentum remains strong, however, as the decline largely reflected swings in inventories and net exports—two volatile categories whose movements last quarter likely carry little signal for future growth."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,Rachel.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"Transcript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference May 4, 2022 CHAIR POWELL."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,Good afternoon.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s nice to see everyone in person for the first time in a couple years.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"Before I go into the details of today’s meeting, I’d like to take this opportunity to speak directly to the American people."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"Inflation is much too high, and we understand the hardship it is causing, and we’re moving expeditiously to bring it back down."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"Indeed, household spending and business fixed investment continued to expand briskly."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,We have both the tools we need and the resolve that it will take to restore price stability on behalf of American families and businesses.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,It is essential that we bring inflation down if we are to have a sustained period of strong labor market conditions that benefit all.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"From the standpoint of our Congressional mandate to promote maximum employment and price stability, the current picture is plain to see: The labor market is extremely tight, and inflation is much too high."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"Against this backdrop, today the FOMC raised its policy interest rate by ½ percentage point and anticipates that ongoing increases in the target rate for the federal funds rate will be appropriate."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"In addition, we are beginning the process of significantly reducing the size of our balance sheet."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,I’ll have more to say about today’s monetary policy actions after briefly reviewing economic developments.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"After expanding at a robust 5½ percent pace last year, overall economic activity edged down in the first quarter."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,The economy and the country have been through a lot over the past two years and have proved resilient.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"I’m sorry, but if inflation is lower one month and the unemployment rate higher, would that be something that we would calibrate toward a lower increase in the funds rate?"
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"We are highly attentive to the risks that high inflation poses to both sides of our mandate, and we are strongly committed to restoring price stability."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"At today’s meeting, the Committee raised the target range for the federal funds rate by ½ percentage point and stated that it “anticipates that ongoing increases in the target range will be appropriate.” We also decided to begin the process of reducing the size of our balance sheet, which will play an important role in firming the stance of monetary policy."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,The Committee is determined to take the measures necessary to restore price stability.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,The American economy is very strong and well positioned to handle tighter monetary policy.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"To conclude: We understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,Everything we do is in service to our public mission.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum-employment and price-stability goals.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you, and I look forward to your questions."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,We are highly attentive to inflation risks.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,NICK TIMIRAOS.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"Chair Powell, the unemployment rate at 3.6 percent in March is now essentially at the level that the Committee had expected would prevail over the next three years and at the bottom end of FOMC participants’ projections for the longer-run rate that you submitted in the projections at the last meeting."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,How has your outlook for further declines in the unemployment rate changed since March?
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,What does this imply for your inflation forecast?
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,And how has your level of confidence changed with regard to the feasibility of slowing hiring without pushing the economy into recession?
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"Nick Timiraos, the Wall Street Journal."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"Against the backdrop of the rapidly evolving economic environment, our policy has been adapting, and it will continue to do so."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,And we will strive to avoid adding uncertainty to what is already an extraordinarily challenging and uncertain time.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"Inflation has obviously surprised to the upside over the past year, and further surprises could be in store."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,We are on a path to move our policy rate expeditiously to more normal levels.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"Assuming that economic and financial conditions evolve in line with expectations, there is a broad sense on the Committee that additional 50-basis-point increases should be on the table at the next couple of meetings."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,We will make our decisions meeting by meeting as we learn from incoming data and the evolving outlook for the economy.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,And we will continue to communicate our thinking as clearly as possible.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,Our overarching focus is using our tools to bring inflation back down to our 2 percent goal.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"With regard to our balance sheet, we also issued our specific plans for reducing our securities holdings."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,We therefore will need to be nimble in responding to incoming data and the evolving outlook.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"Consistent with the principles we issued in January, we intend to significantly reduce the size of our balance sheet over time in a predictable manner by allowing the principal payments from our securities holdings to roll off the balance sheet, up to monthly cap amounts."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"The decline in holdings of Treasury securities under this monthly cap will include Treasury coupon securities and, to the extent that coupon securities are less than the monthly cap, Treasury bills."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"For agency mortgage-backed securities, the cap will be $17.5 billion per month for three months and will then increase to $35 billion per month."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"At the current level of mortgage rates, the actual pace of agency MBS runoff would likely be less than this monthly cap amount."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,Our balance sheet decisions are guided by our maximum- employment and price-stability goals.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, in that regard, we will be prepared to adjust any of the details of our approach in light of economic and financial developments."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,Making appropriate monetary policy in this uncertain environment requires a recognition that the economy often evolves in unexpected ways.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"For Treasury securities, the cap will be $30 billion per month for three months and will then increase to $60 billion per month."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,So people will be coming back into the labor force.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,No.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,So there’s an imbalance there that we have to do our work on.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,There’re more than 5 million more employed plus job openings than there are the size of the labor force.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,There’s a lot of excess demand.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"Again, if you look at it, it’s essentially almost two to one, job vacancies to unemployed people."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, you know, I’ll just say: For now, we’re focused on doing the job we need to do on demand, and there’s plenty to be done there."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"Or will you have to crimp demand maybe even further if the supply chain issues don’t resolve themselves, in order to try and get inflation back down to where you want it to be?"
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I’m just wondering, you know, if these supply chain issues continue because of Russia, because of China, or just because these things take a while to work out, does getting back down to your 2 percent mandate require that the supply chain issues get resolved, since you can only handle the demand side, as you said?"
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"I want to follow up on that, because you all have obviously highlighted that there are both supply and demand issues at play in inflation."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,Victoria Guida from Politico.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,Hi.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,VICTORIA GUIDA.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,Victoria.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, in a way, they’re two further negative shocks that have hit really in the last, you know, 60 days, 90 days."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"So they’re going to weigh on the process of global supply chain healing, which is going to affect broader inflation, too."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,So the second thing is that they’re both capable of preventing further progress in supply chains healing or even making supply chains temporarily worse.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"Obviously, those are very much supply shocks rather than demand side."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,And I wonder what you meant to convey by adding them—I wonder what you meant to convey by adding those.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,Well.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,So our tools don’t really work on supply shocks.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,Our tools work on demand.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, that’s one of the reasons we would tend to focus on that, because we can have more of an effect on that, but it would be a very difficult situation."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"And to the extent we can’t affect, really, oil prices or other commodity prices or food prices and things like that, so we can’t affect those."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"And that—you can see that in the labor market, where demand is substantially in excess of supply of workers."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,And you can see it in the product markets as well.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,But I guess I’m just pointing out that—a couple of things.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"For both the situation in Ukraine and the situation in China, they’re likely to, both, add to headline inflation."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"And people are going to be suffering from that, you know."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"People almost suffer more from food and energy shocks then, but—even though they don’t actually tell us much about the future path."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,But there’s a job to do on demand.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mean, we have to be sure that inflation expectations remain anchored."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I mean, that’s part of our job, too, so we’d be watching that carefully."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,And it puts any central bank in a very difficult situation.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"And that also tends to, you know, to help."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"I will say we were— you know, I think, I think when we got to one-to-one in the, you know, in the late teens, we thought that was a pretty good number."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, again, we’re not shooting for any particular number."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"What we’d like to see is progress, but we’re not really looking at that."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s an intermediate variable.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’re looking at wages, and we’re looking at, ultimately, inflation."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"Because, you know, the longer these expansions go on, you can get very efficient with all of that, and the Beveridge curve shifts out."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, you know, there are a bunch of channels through which policy works."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, there’re big models with, you know, a lot of different channels that are related to that."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, we don’t focus on any one market—the equity market or the housing market—we focus on financial conditions broadly."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we wouldn’t be targeting any one market, as you suggest, for going up or down or taking a view on whether it’s at a good level or a bad level."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"We just would be looking at very broad measures of financial conditions—all the different financial conditions indexes, for example, which include equity."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,I don’t think the one month is—no.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"But they also include debt and other, many other things—credit spreads, things like that—too."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"You can think of it as, you know, interest-sensitive spending, and then you can think of another big one as asset values broadly."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,You mentioned in the statement both the upside risks to inflation from Russia and China.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"And that depends not only on the level of those things—it also, it depends on how well the matching functions in the labor markets are working."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"Okay, so in terms of the vacancies-to-unemployment ratio, we don’t have a goal in mind."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,Howard.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,HOWARD SCHNEIDER.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,Howard Schneider with Reuters.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"And thanks, and nice to be back."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,So two questions.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"There’s no specific number that we’re saying, “We’ve got to get to that.” It’s really, you’ve got to get to a place where the labor market appears to be more in balance."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,One quick one.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,What would you like to see that come down to to think that you’re in sort of a noninflationary vacancy-to-unemployed rate?
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, secondly, on help from inflation, how much are you counting on wealth effects through stock market channels?"
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"Equity markets broadly down quite a bit since late fall, first of the year—how are you mapping that into household consumption?"
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,Have they come down enough?
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,Do you need another leg down in equity values to think that households are going to stop spending at the rate we need them to stop spending?
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"You’ve cited the 1.9 to 1 figure so often now, I’ve got to ask you, what would be a good figure there?"
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,Jeanna Smialek with the New York Times.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"A very difficult situation—you know, you would look at core inflation, which wouldn’t include the commodity price shocks."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, we‘d want to see evidence that inflation is moving in a direction that gives us more comfort."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"So it’s a concept, really."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s not something we can identify with any precision.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,So we estimate it within broad bands of uncertainty.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,And the current estimates on the Committee are sort of 2 to 3 percent.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"And also, that’s a longer-run estimate."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s an estimate for an economy that’s at full employment and 2 percent inflation.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,So—neutral.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, really, what we’re doing is, we’re raising rates expeditiously to what we see as the broad range of plausible levels of neutral."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we’re going to be looking at financial conditions, right?"
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"Our policy affects financial conditions, and financial conditions affect the economy."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,So we’re going to be looking at the effect of our policy moves on financial conditions.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,Are they tightening appropriately?
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,And then we’re going to be looking at the effects on the economy.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,And we’re going to be making a judgment about whether we’ve done enough to get us on a path to restore price stability.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,But we know that there’s not a bright line drawn on the road that tells us when we get there.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s that.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"Given the expectation that inflation will remain well above the Fed’s target at year-end, what constitutes a neutral policy setting in terms of the fed funds rate?"
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,One month’s reading doesn’t tell us much.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thanks, Chair Powell."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"As I said, we’ve got two months now where core inflation is a little lower, but we’re not looking at that as a reason to take some comfort."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, I think we need to really see that our expectation is being fulfilled—that inflation, in fact, is under control and starting to come down."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, again, it’s not like we would stop."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,We would just go back to 25-basis-point increases.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,And to what extent is it appropriate for policy to move beyond that level at some point this year?
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,It’ll be a judgment call when these meetings arrive.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,Okay.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,Let’s go to Colby.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,COLBY SMITH.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,Colby Smith from the Financial Times.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, again, our expectation is, if we see what we expect to see, then we would have 50-basis-point increases on the table at the next two meetings."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"So if that path happens to involve levels that are higher than estimates of neutral, then we will not hesitate to go to those levels."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"When we talk about the neutral rate, we’re really talking about the rate that neither pushes economic activity higher nor slows it down."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,JEANNA SMIALEK.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,And I think that’s a fair description of the picture.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,But it’s really about the risks.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,We don’t see a wage–price spiral.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"We see that companies have the ability to raise prices, and they’re doing that, but there have been price shocks."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,And we need to look around and keep going if we don’t see that financial conditions have tightened adequately or that the economy is behaving in ways that suggest that we’re not where we need to be.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, again, you don’t see those things yet, but I would say there’s no basis for feeling comfortable about that."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,So you can look at that.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s a risk that we simply can’t run.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,And we can’t allow inflation expectations to become unanchored.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s just something that we can’t allow to happen, and so we’ll look at it that way."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,Jeanna.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,We won’t.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,Great.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,We can’t allow a wage–price spiral to happen.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"Longer-term inflation expectations have been reasonably stable but have moved up to—but only to levels where they were in 2014, by some measures."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I just think it takes you back to the basic point—was that we know we need to expeditiously move our policy rate up to ranges of more normal, neutral levels."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, you’re going to raise rates, and you’re going to be kind of inquiring how that is affecting the economy through financial conditions."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, again, there’s a sort of false precision in the discussion that we as policymakers don’t really feel."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"And you can look at that and say, “Well, that’s because people expect inflation to come down.” And, in fact, inflation expectations [at longer horizons] come down fairly sharply."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, of course, if higher rates are required, then we won’t hesitate to deliver them."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,Neil.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,NEIL IRWIN.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,Neil Irwin with Axios.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thanks, Chair Powell."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,Do you see evidence that there is a psychological shift going on on inflation?
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"We don’t really see strong evidence of that yet, but that does not in any way make us comfortable."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think if you look at short-term inflation expectations, they’re quite elevated."
2022-05-04,Press Conf - Full Text,"Do you see evidence that inflationary psychology is changing in areas like workers’ wage demands, businesses’ willingness to raise prices?"
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,But we have to be mindful of the potential effect on inflation expectations [coming] from headline [inflation readings].
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"We can’t affect, really—I mean, the energy prices are set by global commodity prices."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,But it’s—the current situation is particularly difficult because of what I mentioned about expectations.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"And most of food—not all of it, but most food prices are pretty heavily influenced by global commodity prices, too."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,Also other things.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,So we can’t really have much of an effect.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"So it’s a very difficult situation to be in, and we— again, we can’t do much about the difference between [headline and core inflation rates due to] the elements that make up headline that are not in core."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,The SEP is of one piece.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"Could I just, as a follow-up, get a clarification on the SEP?"
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"When the members gave their forecasts, when were they inserted into the record?"
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,Were they revised after the CPI or Michigan numbers came out?
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"In other words, does the SEP, as we have it now, reflect the same factors that led you to go to a 75 basis point move?"
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"As I mentioned, the parts that don’t go into core are mostly outside the scope of our tools, so we look at that."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHAEL MCKEE.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"We, of course, like all central banks do, look very, very carefully at core inflation because it is—it’s a much better predictor, and it’s much—it’s a much better predictor of where inflation is going, and it’s also more relevant to our tools."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"We watch business fixed investment, which actually has softened a bit."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,And inflation means headline inflation.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,It reflects all of the economic readings.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,And we watch—we’re responsible for watching everything.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"Consumption is 60-some percent of the economy, two-thirds of the economy, so, naturally, we spend a lot of time on that."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, again, there’s a lot going on—there are a lot of flows back and forth—but, ultimately, it does appear that the U.S. economy is in a strong position and well positioned to deal with higher interest rates."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,Michael McKee.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,So that’s our ultimate goal.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHAEL MCKEE.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,Michael McKee from Bloomberg Radio and Television.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,Are you targeting headline inflation now or core inflation?
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"In other words, how far would you chase oil prices if they keep going up?"
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"If that’s going to be the component that drives expectations, would you risk recession for a headline rate if the core rate is holding steady or starting to go down?"
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,So the—we’re responsible for inflation in the law.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,It also reflects the 75 basis point increase.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,So that’s how we’re thinking about it.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,So people had that in hand when they—when their SEPs were submitted.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"There’s always a risk of going too far or going not far enough, and it’s going to be a very difficult judgment to make, or maybe not—maybe it’ll be really clear."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,But we’re—and we’re quite mindful of the dangers.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"But I will say, the worst mistake we could make would be to fail, which—it’s not an option."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,We have to restore price stability.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"We really do, because everything—it’s the bedrock of the economy."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"If you don’t have price stability, the economy’s really not going to work the way it’s supposed to."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,It won’t work for people—their wages will be eaten up.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,This inflation happened relatively recently.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,We don’t think that it’s affecting expectations in any kind of fundamental way.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,We don’t think that we’re seeing a wage–price spiral.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"We think that the public generally sees us as very likely to be successful in getting inflation down to 2 percent, and that’s critical."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s absolutely key to the whole thing that we sustain that confidence.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"It would be hard to watch anything much more closely than we watch consumer spending, but we watch everything."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,So we want to get the job done.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,This is important.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"My question is, is inflation data itself the best indicator for when you’re getting to where you need to go, or might it lead you to go too far?"
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"Sorry, I’m not sure I’m getting to your question."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"So it’s—in other words, it’s not in addition to what’s in the SEP."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,The SEP—everyone’s SEP reflects their thinking about this rate increase and what’s going forward.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,Victoria.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,VICTORIA GUIDA.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Victoria Guida from Politico."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,VICTORIA GUIDA.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"I wanted to ask about how you’re measuring progress, especially since you’ve now started front-loading rate hikes more."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I guess my question is, do you think that inflation will tell you—inflation data will tell you when you’ve gone to where you need to go, or do you just feel like maybe it’s better to overshoot than to undershoot?"
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I think the role that we can play—maybe the way to get at this is to say that the role that we can play is around demand, right?"
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we’ll be able to see—the areas that we can affect are those associated with excess demand, and we’ll be able to see our effect on, for example, job openings in real time."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,And that would tell us what’s—that would tell us about wages.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"Wages are not principally responsible for the inflation that we’re seeing, but, going forward, they would be very important, particularly in the service sector."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"You’ve talked about how you want to see inflation coming down over a series of reports, and I guess I’m curious whether you think inflation data itself is a really good indicator or whether you might be concerned that it’s a lagging indicator or that it might send confusing signals given that, as you’ve talked about, there are sort of supply and demand aspects."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we have to go back and establish price stability so we can have that kind of labor market, and that’s a labor market where workers are getting wage increases—maybe the workers at the lower end of the spectrum are getting the biggest wage increases, as they were before the pandemic—where participation is high, where there’s lots of job opportunities, where it’s just a really—I mean, the labor market we had before the pandemic was—that’s what we want to get back to."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,EDWARD LAWRENCE.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,So let me talk about that sentence.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"Clearly, it’s our goal to bring about 2 percent inflation while keeping the labor market strong, right?"
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,And that’s kind of what the SEP says.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"The SEP has inflation getting down to 2, a little above 2 percent in 2024, with unemployment at 4.1 percent."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,And this is a strong labor market—this is a good labor market.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, as I mentioned, there are pathways to do it."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s what we’re trying to do.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,But those pathways have become much more challenging due to factors that are not under our control.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"So the sentence that we deleted said that we believe that appropriate monetary policy, effectively alone, can bring about the result of 2 percent inflation with a strong labor market."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,And so much of it is really not down to monetary policy.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,It just didn’t—the sentence isn’t—it kind of says on its face that monetary policy alone can do this.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"And that’s not—that just didn’t seem appropriate, so we took the sentence out."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,MATTHEW BOESLER.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"And given the new projections for the unemployment rate, could you talk a little bit about what accounts for such reduced confidence against, say, a month ago or three months ago that inflation will largely normalize on its own as these supply-side issues get worked out?"
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"Again, thinking here of the fallout from the war in Ukraine, which has brought a spike in prices of energy, food, fertilizer, industrial chemicals, and also just the supply chains more broadly, which have been larger and longer lasting than anticipated."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,We’re trying to achieve 2 percent inflation consistent with a strong labor market.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,Not trying to induce a recession now.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,BRIAN CHEUNG.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"We never think, “Too many people are working, and fewer people need to have jobs.” But we also think that you really cannot have the kind of labor market we want without price stability."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,And you see disparities between various groups at historic lows.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,We’d love to get back to that place.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, to get there—it’s not going to happen with the levels of inflation we have."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we have to restore that, and it really is in service, in the medium and longer term, of the kind of labor market we want and hope to achieve."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,Let’s be clear about that.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,MATTHEW BOESLER.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Chair Powell."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,Matthew Boesler with Bloomberg.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, as you just mentioned, the Committee is now projecting a ½ percentage point rise in the unemployment rate and the SEPs over the next couple of years, and it removed a line from its policy statement about thinking that the labor market can remain strong while it tightens policy."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"You just mentioned that that is still your objective, though, so I’m wondering if you could explain why that line was removed from the statement—also whether this means the FOMC is trying to induce a recession now to bring inflation down."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,Matt.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"So then as you are raising rates in this economy, how closely are you watching consumer spending, or is there something—another indicator that you’re watching more closely?"
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,We got sort of the opposite.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"I wanted to ask you—you talked about CPI going to 8.6 percent, that retail sales surprised the market by falling and then revisions to the previous months were down."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,Are you hearing from contacts about consumers slowing spending or changing their habits?
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we’re, of course, watching very, very carefully for that and looking at the retail—the big store numbers and all that kind of thing."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"And so I—but I think the fair summary of what we see is, you see continuing shifts in consumption, you see some things getting—sales going down, but overall spending is very strong."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,The consumer’s in really good shape financially.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,Edward Lawrence with Fox Business.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,They’re spending.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,People are talking about it a lot—consumer confidence is very low.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s probably related to gas prices and also just stock prices to some extent for other people.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,But that’s what we’re seeing.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,We’re not seeing a broad slowdown.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"We see job growth slowing, but it’s still at quite robust levels."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,We see the economy slowing a bit but still growth levels—healthy growth levels.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,There’s no sign of a broader slowdown that I can see in the economy.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"Well, yeah, I think you’ve seen—again, we’ve been expecting progress, and we didn’t get that."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thanks, Chair Powell."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hence our resolution to get rates up and, ultimately, get them to where we think they need to be in coming months."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I also think the situation, really—since the consequences of the Ukraine war become more and more clear, what you’re seeing is the situation getting more difficult."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"And you look around the world—I mean, lots of countries are—lots of countries are looking at inflation of 10 percent, and it’s largely due to commodities prices."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"But all over the world, you’re seeing these effects."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"And so—and we’re seeing them here: gas prices at all-time highs, and things like that."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s not something we can do something about.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"So that is really—and, by the way, headline inflation, headline inflation is important for expectations."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,EDWARD LAWRENCE.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"People—the public’s expectations, why would they be distinguishing between core inflation and headline inflation?"
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,But headline inflation is what people experience.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,They don’t know what core is.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,Why would they?
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,They have no reason to.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,So that’s—expectations are very much at risk due to high headline inflation.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"So it’s become—the environment has become more difficult, clearly, in the last four or five months, and hence the need for the policy actions that we took today."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,Core inflation is something we [on the Committee] think about because it is a better predictor of future inflation.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Brian Cheung with Yahoo Finance."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,We need to get back to a place where supply and demand are back together and where inflation is down low again and mortgage rates are low again.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"You talk about consumer sentiment being down, also inflation expectations being up, recession just broadly being dinner table talk."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,But this is a different—these forces are different.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"Inflation is behaving differently, and, in our thinking, it really is a question of very strong demand."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"But you couldn’t get this kind of inflation without a change on the supply side, which is there for anybody to see, which is these blockages and shortages and people dropping out of the labor force and things like that."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,So that’s how we’re looking at it.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we’ve done a lot of work internally on, and thinking about, what all that means."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"You don’t—the thing is, you don’t know whether those forces are—to what extent are they going to be sustained?"
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we’re aware that a different set of forces are driving the economy—we have been, obviously, for quite a while."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"In other words, will we go back to a world where it looks a little more like the old world, or are we really going to be in a world where major supply shocks go on and on?"
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, honestly, we don’t know what that’s going to be."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"In the meantime, we have to find price stability in this new world and maximum employment in this new world where, clearly, inflationary forces are—you’re seeing them everywhere."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"Again, if you look around the world at where inflation levels are, it’s absolutely extraordinary."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s not just here.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"In fact, we’re sort of in the middle of the pack, although I think we have, of course, a different kind of inflation than other people have, partly because our economy is stronger and more highly recovered."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,So that’s what we’re doing.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"The history is, you see these waves of supply shocks, as you did in the ’70s, and then they go away, and sort of there’s a “new normal,” and things settle down."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’ve done a lot of introspection and work on that and—sorry, on QT, we’ve communicated really clearly to the markets about what we’re going to do there."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we have now experienced an extraordinary series of shocks, if you think about it: the pandemic, the response, the reopening, inflation, followed by the war in Ukraine, followed by shutdowns in China—the war in Ukraine potentially having effects for years here."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"So and that’s how all the models work is, decades and decades of data—they look at that."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,EVAN RYSER.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"Evan Ryser, Market News International."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you, Chair Powell."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"I was wondering if the Fed has initiated a review of the conduct of monetary policy over the last two years or so, given the inflation, and will that be shared with the public?"
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"And then, secondly, given the illiquidity and the extraordinary volatility in financial markets, are you concerned that QT will make that worse?"
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s a very flat Philips curve world, and the supply shocks tend to be transient, right?"
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"Sorry, what was your question on QT?"
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"Just given the illiquidity and extraordinary volatility in financial markets, whether QT will make things worse."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, of course, we’ve been looking very carefully and hard at why inflation picked up so much more than expected last year and why it proved so persistent."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"We— it’s hard to overstate the extent of interest we have in that question morning, noon, and night."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,But you have to understand the context.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"For—really, the context is this: For decades before the pandemic and the reopening, you had a world where inflation was dominated by disinflationary forces such as declining population or aging demographics, let’s call it that, globalization enabled by technology, other factors, low productivity."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,EVAN RYSER.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,Evan.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,Markets seem to be okay with it.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,I have no reason to think it will lead to illiquidity and problems.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,So thank you very much.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,How much will it really affect residential investment?
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,Not really sure.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,How much will it affect housing prices?
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,Not really sure.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s—I mean, obviously, we’re watching that quite carefully."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,We’re watching it to see what will happen.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"You would think over time—I mean, so there’s a tremendous amount of supply in the housing market of unfinished homes, and as those come on line—whereas the supply of finished homes, inventory of finished homes that are for sale, is incredibly low, historically low."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,So prices may keep going up for a while even in a world where rates are up.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,So it’s a complicated situation.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,We watch it very carefully.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"I would say if you’re a homebuyer, somebody or a young person looking to buy a home, you need a bit of a reset."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"So this will be a process whereby we—ideally, we do our work in a way that the housing market settles in a new place and housing availability and credit availability are at appropriate levels."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’re not—again, we’re not, we don’t seek to put people out of work, of course."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,So it’s still a very tight market.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’re phasing in—Treasury [security] issuance is down quite a lot, quite a lot from where it’s been, so I have no reason to think—markets are forward looking, and they see this coming."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"So that changes now, and rates have moved up—we’re well aware that mortgage rates have moved up a lot—and you’re seeing a changing housing market."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,And so the demand was just suddenly much higher.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,It seems to be kind of understood and accepted at this point.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"For the last question, we’ll go to Mark Hamrick."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,MARK HAMRICK.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"Mr. Chairman, Mark Hamrick with Bankrate."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we saw prices moving up very, very strongly for the last couple of years."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"I wonder what your assessment is about the outlook for the housing market, given the years-long increase in home prices and now the sharp rise in mortgage rates."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,Sure.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"So rates were very low—a good place to start is that rates were very, very low for quite a while because of the pandemic and the need to do everything we could to support the economy when unemployment was 14 percent and the true unemployment rate was well higher than that."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"And that was a—rates are low, and now they’re coming back up to more normal, or above, levels."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, in the meantime, while rates were low and while demand was really high, obviously demand for housing changed from wanting to live in urban areas to some extent to living in single-family homes in the suburbs, famously."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"And all that, of course, given the heightened sensitivity around the housing market given the fact that it was a trigger for the great financial crisis over a decade ago."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,Okay.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, again, we’ll be determined and resolved, but flexible."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"But aside from rises in commodity prices such as gas prices, we’re also seeing stickier measures of inflation increasing, such as the Cleveland Fed’s median and trimmed mean CPIs."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mean, how persistent do you see those underlying measures of inflation, and how do you expect to—where do you see those going in the near future?"
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, as I mentioned, I think, in my opening statement, inflation has started—it started off in quite narrow, very directly pandemic-related areas, and it’s spread now broadly across the economy and into the services sector as well."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,It was really in the goods sector at the beginning.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, particularly, you’re seeing in travel now, if you’ve flown on a plane lately—planes are very full, and plane tickets are very expensive."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"You have talked about inflation a few times and mentioned oil prices, China lockdowns."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"Some of that will be pass- through of energy prices, but it’s—so you’re experiencing services inflation."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"So the question—and then you see the Cleveland measure going up, and many other measures are going up."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"So it’s a time when we’re not seeing progress and we want to see progress, and that’s really another part of why we did what we did today and why the SEP looks like it does."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"We see it as appropriate to get the policy rate up to restrictive levels, which would be, in the thinking of the Committee, somewhere in the range of 3 to 3½ percent by year-end."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"And then after that, you see what the rest of the SEP says."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,So I hope that’s responsive to your question.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,Shelter inflation is high.

2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"Does the general feel among American households and also businesses square with your explanation of the economy, given that the description of inflation in the statement didn’t change between May and June?"
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, clearly, people don’t like inflation—a lot."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"And many people are experiencing it, really, for the first time, because we haven’t had anything like this kind of inflation in 40 years."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,And it’s really something people don’t like.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"And they’re experiencing that, and that’s showing up in their—in surveys and in all kinds of ways."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,So that’s really what we’re saying.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’re not—I’m not—clearly, it’s an incredibly unpopular thing, and it’s very painful for people."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"I guess what I’m saying is, the question, the really critical question from the perspective of doing our job is making sure that the public does have confidence that we have the tools and will use them and they do work to bring inflation back down over time."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"It will take some time, we think, to get inflation back down, but we will do that."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,Chris.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we understand that, and we understand the hardship that people are experiencing from high inflation, and we’re determined to do what we can to get inflation back down."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Chair Powell."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,Nancy Marshall-Genzer with Marketplace.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,And what evidence would get you to stop rate hikes and maybe even reverse them?
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,Sure.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, as I mentioned, financial conditions have tightened over the last seven months, and that’s a good thing, we think."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"But the federal funds rate, even after this increase, is at 1.6 percent."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,So it’s hard to see how that is too high of a rate.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,So could you talk a little bit more about that?
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"And even if we did another—so we’re going to get here by the end of the summer, somewhere in the 2s probably."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,So that’s not a rate that is calculated to bring a recession on.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we’ll—by then, we’ll have seen a whole lot more data."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"As I mentioned a couple times, the Committee’s views are around a modestly restrictive stance, which will be in the 3 to 3½ percent range by the end of this year, but that’s conditioned on that being the appropriate thing to do."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"If we see data going in a different direction, it’ll be reflected in our policy, as you see today."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’ll be watching—if things go in a direction we don’t expect, then we’re going to adapt."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I would say, this is a highly uncertain environment—extraordinarily uncertain environment."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"Still, that’s still a low rate."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"Chair Powell, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more—economists are worried that you’re kind of hitting the economy with a sledgehammer and that now there’s even more risk of a recession than a 50–50 path of rates."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,Greg Robb from MarketWatch.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"Do you still think a softish landing is possible, and how would you define that at this point considering the revised projections for unemployment, GDP, inflation?"
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,So I think what’s in the SEP would certainly meet that test.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"If you see—you’re looking at getting back down to almost a 2 percent inflation by 2024, and the unemployment rate is still as low as 4.1 percent."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,That would be—I would call that as meeting that test.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,Do I still think that we can do that?
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,I do.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,I think there’s—I think there’s—I don’t want to be the handicapper here.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"I just—that is our objective, and I do think it’s possible."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"Like I said, though, I think that events of the last few months have raised the degree of difficulty, created great challenges."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, again, the answer to the question, can we still do it—there’s a much bigger chance now that it’ll depend on factors that we don’t control, which is, fluctuations and spikes in commodity prices could wind up taking that option out of our hands."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we just don’t know, but we’re focused on—very, very focused on getting inflation back down to 2 percent, which we think is essential for the benefit of the public and also to put us on a path back to a sustainably strong labor market like the one we had before the pandemic."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,Greg.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,GREG ROBB.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"I just want to expand, I guess, on what you just said now about the general public feeling like you can get this done."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"In contrast, growth in business fixed investment appears to be slowing, and activity in the housing sector looks to be softening, in part reflecting higher mortgage rates."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,RACHEL SIEGEL.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,Jeanna Smialek with the New York Times.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,You—I guess I wonder if you could describe for us a little bit how you’re deciding how aggressive you need to be.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, obviously, 75 today."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"What did 75 achieve that 50 wouldn’t have, and why not just go for a full percentage point at some point?"
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,Sure.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks for taking our questions.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"So if you take a step back, what we’re looking for is compelling evidence that inflationary pressures are abating and that inflation is moving back down."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, by this point, we had actually been expecting to see clear signs of at least inflation flattening out and, ideally, beginning to decline."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’ve said that we’d be data dependent, focused on incoming data, highly attentive to inflation risks—the things that I mentioned to Howard moments ago."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"So contrary to expectations, inflation again surprised to the upside."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"Indicators—some indicators of inflation expectations have risen, and projections of [inflation] this year have moved up notably."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we thought that strong action was warranted at this meeting, and today we delivered that in the form of a 75 basis point rate hike, as I mentioned."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"So the point of it, really, is this: We’ve been moving rates up expeditiously to more normal levels, and over the course of the seven months since we pivoted and began moving in this direction, we’ve seen financial conditions tighten, and appropriately so."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,And we’d like to see that in the form of a series of declining monthly inflation readings— that’s what we’re looking for.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"But the federal funds rate, even after this move, is at 1.6 percent."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,JEANNA SMIALEK.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,Okay.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, as you know, we always aim to provide as much clarity as we can about our policy intentions subject to the inherent uncertainty in the economic outlook, because we think monetary policy is more effective when market participants understand how policy will evolve, when they understand our objective function, our reaction function."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"And in the current highly unusual circumstances with inflation well above our goal, we think it’s helpful to provide even more clarity than usual—again, subject to uncertainty in the outlook."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I think over the course of this year, financial markets have responded and have, generally, shown that they understand the path we’re laying out."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"Of course, it remains data dependent."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"And so that’s what we generally think about guidance, and that’s why we offer it."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, of course, when we offered that—when I offered that guidance at the last meeting, I did say that it was subject to the economy performing about in line with expectations."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,Jeanna.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"I also said that if the economy performed—if data came in worse than expected, then we would consider moving even more aggressively."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"So then the question is, what do you do?"
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,And do you wait six weeks to do it at the next meeting?
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I think the answer is, that’s not where we are with this."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we decided we needed to go ahead, and so we did."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,And that’s really—that’s really how we made the decision.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we got the CPI data and also some data on inflation expectations late last week, and we thought for a while, and we thought, well, this is the appropriate thing to do."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, again, the Committee is moving rates up expeditiously to more normal levels, and we came to the view that we’d like to do a little more front-end loading on that."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,This was really about the speed in which we would get there.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"And just as a follow-up, could you break that apart for me?"
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"How much of that is restrictive, and how much of that is a normal positive rate that ought to be embedded or not, in your opinion, in the funds rate?"
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,Sure.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"So the question really is, how high does the rate really need to go?"
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"Now that the Committee is projecting 4 percent on a—or 3.8 percent next year in terms of the funds rate, which is similar to where the market is now, the futures market of 4 percent funds rate next year, do you think that’s a level that is going to be sufficiently high enough to deal with and bring down the inflation problem?"
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,And this is—the estimates on the Committee are in that range of 3½ to 4 percent.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"Well, you can think about the longer-run neutral rate, you can compare it to that, and we think that’s in the mid-2s."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"You can look, frankly, at broader financial conditions."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"You can look at asset prices, you can look at the effect they’re having on the economy, rates, asset prices, credit spreads—all of those things go into that."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"You can also look at the yield curve and ask, all along the yield curve, where is the policy rate?"
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"So for much of the yield curve now, real rates are positive."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s not true at the short end.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,And how do you think about that?
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,So I think that the SEP gives you the levels that people think are appropriate at given points in time.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"You have not used the phrase in a long time “monetary policy is in a good place,” which is a phrase that you used to use often."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"Steve Liesman, CNBC."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, as I mentioned, 75 basis points today—I said the next meeting could well be about a decision between 50 and 75."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"That would put us, at the end of the July meeting, in that range—in that more normal range, and that’s a desirable place to be, because you begin to have more optionality there about the speed with which you would proceed going forward."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,Just talking about the SEP for a second: What it really says is that Committee participants widely would like to see policy at a modestly restricted—restrictive level at the end of this year.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"And that’s six months from now, and so much data [can accrue] and so much can happen, so remember how highly uncertain this is."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,But so that is generally a range of 3 to 3½ percent.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"That’s where people are, and that’s what they want to see, knowing what they know now and understanding that we need to be—we need to show resolve but also be flexible [in responding] to incoming data as we see it."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you for taking my question, Mr. Chairman."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"If things are better, we don’t need to do that much, and if they’re not, then we either do that much or possibly even more."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"Then you’re looking at next year, and what you’re seeing is, people see more—a bit more tightening and a range of maybe 3½ to 4 percent."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,And that’s generally what people see as the appropriate path for getting inflation under control and starting back down and getting back down to 2 percent.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"So 75 basis points seemed like the right thing to do at this meeting, and that’s what we did."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,Steve.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,STEVE LIESMAN.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"But in any case, it will be very data dependent."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"At the short end of the yield curve in the early years, you don’t have real—you have negative rates still."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,And would you please give us as detailed a sense as you can of what role you played in reshaping market expectations so quickly on Monday?
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,Two related questions.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"Improvements in labor market conditions have been widespread, including for workers at the lower end of the wage distribution as well as for African Americans and Hispanics."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"Labor demand is very strong, while labor supply remains subdued, with the labor force participation rate little changed since January."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"FOMC participants expect supply and demand conditions in the labor market to come into better balance, easing the upward pressures on wages and prices."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"The median projection in the SEP for the unemployment rate rises somewhat over the next few years, moving from 3.7 percent at the end of this year to 4.1 percent in 2024, levels that are noticeably above the March projections."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,Inflation remains well above our longer-run goal of 2 percent.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"Over the 12 months ending in April, total PCE prices rose 6.3 percent; excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core prices rose 4.9 percent."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"Over the past three months, employment rose by an average of 408,000 jobs per month, down from the average pace seen earlier in the year but still robust."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"In May, the 12-month change in the consumer price index came in above expectations at 8.6 percent, and the change in the core CPI was 6 percent."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,The surge in prices of crude oil and other commodities that resulted from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is boosting prices for gasoline and food and is creating additional upward pressure on inflation.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,And COVID-related lockdowns in China are likely to exacerbate supply chain disruptions.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"FOMC participants have revised up their projections for inflation this year, particularly for total PCE inflation given developments in food and energy prices."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,The median projection is 5.2 percent this year and falls to 2.6 percent next year and 2.2 percent in 2024.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,Participants continue to see risks to inflation as weighted to the upside.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,The Fed’s monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"Aggregate demand is strong, supply constraints have been larger and longer lasting than anticipated, and price pressures have spread to a broad range of goods and services."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"My colleagues and I are acutely aware that high inflation imposes significant hardship, especially on those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"The labor market has remained extremely tight, with the unemployment rate near a 50-year low, job vacancies at historical highs, and wage growth elevated."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,The tightening in financial conditions that we’ve seen in recent months should continue to temper growth and help bring demand into better balance with supply.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,Would that include people losing their jobs?
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"Transcript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference June 15, 2022 CHAIR POWELL."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,Good afternoon.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,I will begin with one overarching message: We at the Fed understand the hardship that high inflation is causing.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"We are strongly committed to bringing inflation back down, and we’re moving expeditiously to do so."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,We have both the tools we need and the resolve that it will take to restore price stability on behalf of American families and businesses.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"As shown in our Summary of Economic Projections, FOMC participants have marked down their projections for economic activity, with the median projection for real GDP growth running below 2 percent through 2024."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,The economy and the country have been through a lot over the past two and a half years and have proved resilient.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"From the standpoint of our congressional mandate to promote maximum employment and price stability, the current picture is plain to see: The labor market is extremely tight, and inflation is much too high."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"Against this backdrop, today the Federal Open Market Committee raised its policy interest rate by ¾ percentage point and anticipates that ongoing increases in that rate will be appropriate."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"In addition, we are continuing the process of significantly reducing the size of our balance sheet."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,I’ll have more to say about today’s monetary policy actions after briefly reviewing economic developments.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"Overall economic activity edged down in the first quarter, as unusually sharp swings in inventories and net exports more than offset continued strong underlying demand."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"Recent indicators suggest that real GDP growth has picked up this quarter, with consumption spending remaining strong."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,It is essential that we bring inflation down if we are to have a sustained period of strong labor market conditions that benefit all.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"Chair Powell, do you feel you boxed yourself in with the language you used at the last press conference on 50 basis point hikes in June and July?"
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"We are highly attentive to the risks high inflation poses to both sides of our mandate, and we are strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent objective."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"At today’s meeting, the Committee raised the target range for the federal funds rate by ¾ percentage point, resulting in a 1½ percentage point increase in the target range so far this year."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"Inflation has obviously surprised to the upside over the past year, and further surprises could be in store."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,We therefore will need to be nimble in responding to incoming data and the evolving outlook.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,And we will strive to avoid adding uncertainty in what is already an extraordinarily challenging and uncertain time.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,We are highly attentive to inflation risks and determined to take the measures necessary to restore price stability.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,The American economy is very strong and well positioned to handle tighter monetary policy.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"To conclude: We understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,Making appropriate monetary policy in this uncertain environment requires a recognition that the economy often evolves in unexpected ways.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum-employment and price-stability goals.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,And I look forward to your questions.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,Howard.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,HOWARD SCHNEIDER.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,Howard Schneider with Reuters.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"Against the backdrop of the rapidly evolving economic environment, our policy has been adapting, and it will continue to do so."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,Our overarching focus is using our tools to bring inflation back down to our 2 percent goal and to keep longer-term inflation expectations well anchored.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"From the perspective of today, either a 50 basis point or a 75 basis point increase seems most likely at our next meeting."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,The Committee reiterated that it anticipates that ongoing increases in the target range will be appropriate.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,And we are continuing the process of significantly reducing the size of our balance sheet—which plays an important role in firming the stance of monetary policy.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"Coming out of our last meeting in May, there was a broad sense on the Committee that a ½ percentage point increase in the target range should be considered at this meeting if economic and financial conditions evolved in line with expectations."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,We also stated that we were highly attentive to inflation risks and that we would be nimble in responding to incoming data and the evolving outlook.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"Since then, inflation has again surprised to the upside, some indicators of inflation expectations have risen, and projections for inflation this year have been revised up notably."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"In response to these developments, the Committee decided that a larger increase in the target range was warranted at today’s meeting."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"We will, however, make our decisions meeting by meeting, and we will continue to communicate our thinking as clearly as we can."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,This continues our approach of expeditiously moving our policy rate up to more normal levels.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"As shown in the SEP, the median projection for the appropriate level of the federal funds rate is 3.4 percent at the end of this year, 1.5 percentage points higher than projected in March and 0.9 percentage point above the median estimate of its longer-run value."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"The median projection rises further to 3.8 percent at the end of next year and declines to 3.4 percent in 2024, still above the median longer-run value."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"Of course, these projections do not represent a Committee plan or decision, and no one knows with any certainty where the economy will be a year or more from now."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"Over coming months, we will be looking for compelling evidence that inflation is moving down, consistent with inflation returning to 2 percent."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,We anticipate that ongoing rate increases will be appropriate; the pace of those changes will continue to depend on the incoming data and the evolving outlook for the economy.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"Clearly, today’s 75 basis point increase is an unusually large one, and I do not expect moves of this size to be common."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,And it will help ensure that longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2 percent.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,So that really is one data point—it’s one part of financial conditions.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,Everything we do is in service to our public mission.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,That affects financial conditions.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,COLBY SMITH.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,What’s the potential tradeoff with higher unemployment than even what’s forecasted in the SEP if inflation is not moderating at an acceptable pace?
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,Right.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, what we want to see is a series of declining monthly readings for inflation, and we’d like to see inflation headed down."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, you know—and right now, our policy rate is well below neutral, right?"
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,The second part I didn’t get.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, soon enough, we’ll have our policy rate— let’s assume the world works out about like the SEP says: The policy rate will be up where we think it should be."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"Does it make you— you’ll be making these judgments about, is it appropriate now to slow down—from 50 to 25, let’s say—or speed up?"
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"So that’s the kind of thinking we’ll be doing, and, again, we’re looking—ultimately, we’re not going to declare victory until we see a series of these, really see convincing evidence, compelling evidence, that inflation is coming down."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"And that’s what I mean by—that’s what it would take for us to say, “Okay, we think this job is done.” Because we saw—and, frankly, we saw last year—inflation came down over the course of the summer and then turned right around and went back up."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,So I think we’re going to be careful about declaring victory.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"But our—again, the implementation of our policy is going to be flexible and sensitive to incoming data."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,COLBY SMITH.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,And then the question would be: Do you slow down?
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"Are you more concerned now that to bring down inflation, it’s going to require more than just some pain at this point?"
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"On the “clear and convincing” threshold for the inflation trajectory, what is the level of realized inflation that meets that criteria?"
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"And if we don’t see that, then that’s the kind of thing that will—even if we don’t see progress for a longer period, that could cause us to react."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,But we will.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"Soon enough, we will be seeing some progress at some point."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we’ll react [as] appropriate to that, too."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"But I would like to think, though, that our guidance is still credible, but it’s always going to be conditional on what happens."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"This is an unusual situation, to get, you know, some data late in, during blackout, pretty close to—very close to our meeting."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,And how is the Committee thinking about the potential tradeoff of much higher unemployment than even in what’s forecasted in the SEP if inflation is not moderating at this acceptable pace?
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,Very unusual to [have] one that would actually change the outcome.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,So I don’t think it’s something that’ll come up a great deal.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,Colby.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,COLBY SMITH.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you so much for taking our questions.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,Colby Smith with the Financial Times.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I’ve only seen—in my 10-years-plus here at the Fed, I’ve only seen something like that, even close to that, one or two times."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"We want to see—inflation can’t go down until it flattens out, and that’s what we’re looking to see."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,I think that what’s becoming more clear is that many factors that we don’t control are going to play a very significant role in deciding whether that’s possible or not.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,So the new projections show the unemployment rate ticking up through 2024.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,Is a higher unemployment rate necessary in order to combat inflation?
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,And what is lost if the unemployment rate has to go up and people lose their jobs in order to control inflation?
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,So you’re right.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,Rachel Siegel from the Washington Post.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"In the SEP, we have unemployment going up to 4 point—the median is 4.1 percent—of course, [there is] a range of actual forecasts."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"We hadn’t seen—we hadn’t seen rates, unemployment rates below 4 percent until a couple years ago for—we’d seen it for, like, one year in the last 50."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,So the idea that—3.6 percent is historically low in the last century.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,So a 4.1 percent unemployment rate with inflation well on its way to 2 percent—I think that would be—I think that would be a successful outcome.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,So we’re not looking to have a higher unemployment rate.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,So I think—I have to look at it this way: We move the policy rate.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,But I would say that I would certainly look at that as a successful outcome.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I would characterize that, if you were to get inflation down to, you know, on its way down to 2 percent and the unemployment rate went up to 4.1 percent, that’s still a historically low level."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"Again, I think that—I do think that our objective, and this is what’s reflected in the SEP, but our objective, really, is to bring inflation down to 2 percent while the labor market remains strong."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you for taking our questions.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,RACHEL SIEGEL.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"And there I’m thinking, of course, of commodity prices, the war in Ukraine, supply chain [developments], things like that, where we really—the monetary policy stance doesn’t affect those things."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"Take, for example, in the labor market."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"So you have two job vacancies, essentially, for every person actively seeking a job, and that has led to a real imbalance in wage negotiating."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"You could get to a place where that ratio was at a more normal level, and you wouldn’t—you would expect to see those wage pressures move back down to a level where people are still getting healthy wage increases, real wage increases, but at a level that’s consistent with 2 percent inflation."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,So that’s a possibility.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"And you could say the same thing about some of the product markets where there’s just excess capacity and really where the strong demand has gone into—sorry, where they’re capacity constrained, right?"
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Chair Powell."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"So you have, effectively, what we think of as a vertical supply curve or close to it."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"So in principle, that could work in reverse."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"When demand comes down, you could see—and it’s not guaranteed—but you could see prices coming down more than the typical economic relationships that you see in the textbooks would suggest, because of the unusual situation we’re in on the supply side."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,So there’s a pathway there.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"It is not going to be easy, and there—again, it’s our objective, but, as I mentioned, it’s going to depend to some extent on factors we don’t control."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,Rachel.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"So demand comes in, and it’s very strong, and it shows up in higher prices—not higher quantities, not more cars, because they can’t make the cars because they don’t have the semiconductors."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,We want to see progress.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"But having said that, there is a path for us to get there—it’s not getting easier; it’s getting more challenging because of these external forces—and that path is to move demand down, and you have a lot of surplus demand."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,And I would hope that our—it’s always going to be—any guidance that we give is always going to be subject to things working out about as we expect.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,We’re going to find that out empirically.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,We’re not going to be completely model driven about this.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’re going to be looking at this, keeping our eyes open, and reacting to incoming data both on financial conditions and on what’s happening in the economy."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,Nick.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,NICK TIMIRAOS.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I would think it would, but you know what?"
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"Chair Powell, you’ve said that you like your policy to work through expectations."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"And now, obviously, this decision was something quite different from how you and almost all of your colleagues had set those expectations during the intermeeting period."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,And I know you just said that what changed was really the inflation data—the inflation expectations data.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"But I’m wondering, on the inflation expectations data, was there something you saw that was unsettling enough to risk eroding the credibility of your verbal guidance by doing something so different from what you had “socialized” before?"
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"So if you look at a broad range of inflation expectations—so you’ve got the public, you’ve got surveys of the public and of experts, and you’ve also got market based."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,Nick Timiraos.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,I think that the neutral rate is pretty low these days.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mean, honestly, though, that would be—you would have positive real rates, I think, and inflation coming down by then."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,I think we’ll know when we get there really.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,And that affects the economy.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"We have, of course, ways—rigorous ways to think about it, but, ultimately, it comes down to, do we think financial conditions are in a place where they’re having the desired effect on the economy?"
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, in this particular situation, you know, we’re looking for something specific, and that is progress on inflation."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"And that desired affect is, we’d like to see demand moderating."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,Demand is very hot still in the economy.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’d like to see the labor market getting better in balance between supply and demand, and that can happen [as a result of developments coming] both from supply and demand."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"Right now, there’s—demand is substantially higher than available supply, though, so we feel that there’s a role for us in moderating demand."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,Those are the things we can affect with our policy tools.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"There are many things we can’t affect, and those would be, you know, the things—the commodity price issues that we’re having around the world due to the war in Ukraine and the fallout from that, and also just all of the supply-side things that are still pushing upward on inflation."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,So that’s really how I think—how I think about it.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,STEVE LIESMAN.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"But does 3.8 percent, 4 percent get it done?"
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,Does it get the job done on breaking the back of inflation?
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,I think it’s certainly in the range of plausible numbers.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I think if you look across that broad range of data, what you see is that expectations are still in the place, very much in the place, where short-term inflation is going to be high but comes down sharply over the next couple of years."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,And that’s really where inflation expectations are.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,I think you’d have positive real rates across the [yield] curve.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,And so this is really very important to us—that that remain the case.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Chair Powell."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,Neil Irwin from Axios.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks for taking our questions.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,The late-breaking kind of decision to go to 75 basis points—do you worry that that will make policy guidance a less effective tool in the future?
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"To take your second question first, yes."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,NEIL IRWIN.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mean, I think we’re— again, we’re going, we’re resolved to take this on, but we’re going to be flexible in the implementation of it."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, again, the overall exercise is that we try to be—provide as much clarity about our policy intentions as we can, because we think that makes monetary policy work better."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"There’s always a tradeoff, because you have to live with that guidance, and so you do it, and it helps a lot of the time."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"And also, as you get away from this episode, they get back down close to 2 percent."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"I, frankly, think this year has been a demonstration of how well it can work."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"With us having really just done very little in the way of raising interest rates, financial conditions have tightened quite significantly through the expectations channel, as we’ve made it clear what our plans are."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,So I think that’s been a very healthy thing to be happening.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,Sorry—and your [first] question was [about] guidance.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,Neil.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,And should we think of that as a kind of symmetrical reaction function if we start to get soft readings on inflation or if the labor market starts to roll over?
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,That was one of the reasons—the other was just the CPI reading.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"So the preliminary Michigan [survey] reading—it’s a preliminary reading; it might be revised—nonetheless, it was quite eye-catching, and we noticed that."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"We also noticed that the index of common inflation expectations at the Board has moved up after being pretty flat for a long time, so we’re watching that, and we’re thinking, “this is something we need to take seriously.” And that is one of the factors, as I mentioned—one of the factors in our deciding to move ahead with 75 basis points today was what we saw in inflation expectations."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,We’re absolutely determined to keep them anchored at 2 percent.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,We do not take this for granted—we take it very seriously.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,NICK TIMIRAOS.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"So if you saw a movement like that again, another tick-up in inflation expectations, would that put a 75 or even 100 basis point increase in play at your next meeting?"
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I think if you look for most measures, most of the time, that’s what you see."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"If we even see a couple of indicators that bring that into question, we take that very seriously."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’re going to—I’ll just say, we’re going to react to the incoming data and appropriately, I think."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,So I wouldn’t want to put a number on what that might be.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"The main thing is to get rates up, and then pretty soon, we’ll be in an area where we’re—I think as you get closer to the end of the year, you’re in a range where you’ve got restrictive policy, which is appropriate."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,"Forty-year highs in inflation—we think that policy is going to need to be restrictive, and we don’t know how restrictive."
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,So I think that’s how we’ll take it.
2022-06-15,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,And is reaching the minimum level of reserves needed in the system still several years away at the current pace?
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,So I guess your second question was getting—the process of getting back down to the new equilibrium will take a while.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s been working for a couple months now and in a different environment than the last time the Fed did it.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,I wanted to ask about the balance sheet reduction program.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,What are you learning about how it’s working and how markets are reacting?
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,So we think it’s working fine.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,So I would say the plan is broadly on track.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, and in September, we’ll go to full strength."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"And that time, it’s hard to be precise, but, you know, the model would suggest that it could be between two, two and a half years, that kind of thing."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,And the markets seem to have accepted it.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"By all assessments, the markets should be able to absorb this."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,And we expect that’ll be the case.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s a little bit slow to get going because some of these trades don’t settle until—for a bit of time.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,But it’ll be picking up steam.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,Jean Yung with Market News.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"As you know, we, we tapered up into it."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,And we’ll keep trying to achieve it.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,Jean.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,And this is a much faster pace than the last time.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, how do bank forecasts of possible recessions, economists, does that affect the soft landing?"
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"Well, you know, we’ve said since the beginning, I think, that, that having a soft landing is what we’re aiming for."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"Of course, that has to be our goal."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,It is our goal.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think—I do think events—at the beginning, we said it was not going to be easy."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,It was going to be quite challenging to do that.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,JEAN YUNG.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s unusual.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s not a typical event, given where we are."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"If there is a path to it, and we think there is, it is the one I mentioned, that the labor market actually is—has such a large amount of surplus demand that you could see—you could see that demand coming down in a way that didn’t translate into a big increase in unemployment as you would expect in the ordinary course because, frankly, the imbalance is so much greater."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, but we don’t know that."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mean, this is a—this is a case of first impression."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,So anyone who is really sure that it’s impossible or really sure that it will happen is probably underestimating the level of uncertainty.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"And so I would certainly say it’s an uncertain, uncertain thing."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"Nonetheless, it’s our goal to achieve it, and we’ll keep trying to do that."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s an unusual event.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"Balance sheet’s much, much bigger than it was."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, yes, we said that we wouldn’t lift off until we had basically achieved our dual-mandate goals."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,And we have no reason to think it’s not.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,GREG ROBB.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you, Chair Powell."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,Greg Robb from MarketWatch.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"I wonder if you can go back a little bit in time to before there was this outbreak of inflation, when the Committee put in place forward guidance on tapering asset purchases."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,I think it was December 2020.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"There’s a recent speech by Fed Governor Waller talking about that and saying that maybe that was too tight, that kind of condition, and it put you a little bit behind—not his words but maybe, you know, were kind of late to react to some of that inflation."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"So could you talk about that decision, and have you looked at it in hindsight at all?"
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"And the reason we did it in real time was that, the first look at the new framework that we’d rolled out, plenty of people were saying, “It’s not credible."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"You’ll never get inflation to 2 percent.” Some of our critics now who say inflation’s too tight—too high were the same ones who were saying, “You’ll never get to 2 percent.” Well, but anyway, that’s what happened."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we, we thought we needed to really make a strong statement with that."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,It wasn’t part of the framework.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,The December ’20 guidance was not part of our overall new framework.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,It was just guidance that we put in place.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,Forecasts.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,So I would say two things.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,Greg.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"But we looked at this carefully, and we thought that this, this was the sensible pace."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,So that’s how we’re going to take it.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.

2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,BRIAN CHEUNG.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Chairman Powell."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"Brian Cheung, Yahoo Finance."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"Looking at financial conditions, it seems like the tightening has slowed as of late with the 10 year coming down, 30-year fixed mortgage rates also going a bit sideways, when we talk about a hot housing market still."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"Just wondering if you find financial conditions tight enough, especially as you continue to raise rates."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"So a big piece of that is inflation expectations—you know, breakevens coming down, which, you know, is a good thing."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s a good thing that markets do seem to have confidence in, in the Committee’s commitment to getting inflation back down to 2 percent."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we like to see market-based, you know, readings of inflation expectations come down."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, broader financial conditions have tightened, tightened a good bit."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mean, the way this works is we, we set our policy, and financial conditions react, and then financial conditions are what affects the economy."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,And we don’t control that second step.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,We’re just going to do what we think needs to be done.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,We’re going to—we’re going to get our policy rate to a level where we’re confident that inflation will be moving back down to 2 percent.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,Confident.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, of course, we’ll be watching financial conditions to see that they are appropriately tight and that they’re having the effect that we would hope they’re having, which is to see demand moderate and inflationary pressures recede and, ultimately, inflation come down."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"Sorry, what was the— EDWARD LAWRENCE."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,We don’t know the situation.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,But the slowdown in the second quarter is notable.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,Wages are high.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"So it’s the kind of thing where you think that the—that the economy should actually be, be doing pretty well in the second half of the year."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,But we’ll have to see.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,We don’t know that because you do see a marked slowing in the second quarter that does—that is fairly broad.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,So we’ll be watching that.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,We’ll be watching that.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"Of course, as I mentioned, we do want to see demand running below potential for a sustained period to create slack and, and give inflation a chance to come down."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,Nicole.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,NICOLE GOODKIND.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, thank you, Chairman."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"Nicole Goodkind, CNN Business."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,When does the Committee expect to see a meaningful slowdown in the labor market?
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,And how much weakness will it accept with regard to slower job growth and higher unemployment before it pauses or begins to think about cutting rates?
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I think you’re already seeing—you’ve seen, in the labor market, what you’ve seen is a decline from very high levels of job creation last year and earlier this year to modestly slower job creation—still, still quite robust, as I mentioned."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,So you’re seeing that.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"There are many, many job openings."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"You’re seeing some increase—some increase in initial claims from insurance, although that may actually have to do with seasonal adjustments."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,The labor market’s very hot.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,There are—there is a great deal of money on people’s balance sheets that they can spend.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"One, I don’t think that that has materially changed the situation."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"The strong dollar effect may hit in 2023, when the economy might be weak."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"How, how do you know where you are and where you think you need to get to?"
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"Well, just talking about demand for a second: As I mentioned in my remarks, I think you pretty clearly do see a slowing now in demand in the second quarter— consumer spending, business fixed investment, housing, places like that."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think, you know, people widely looked at the first-quarter numbers and thought they didn’t make sense and might have been misleading in terms of the overall direction of the economy—[that was] not, not true of the second quarter."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"But at the same time, you have this labor market."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,So there are plenty of experiences where GDP has been reported as weak and the labor market as strong.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,And the economy has gone right through that and been fine.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,So that—that’s happened many times.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"And it used to happen—if you remember, in the first quarter of every year, for several years in a row, GDP was negative, and the labor market was moving on just fine."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,And it turned out to just be measurement error.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,It was called residual seasonality.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,We do.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,How much is it moderating?
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,We’re not sure.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,We’re going to have to watch the data carefully.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,The unemployment rate is very low.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,We’re not sure that that’s actually real.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"There’s some evidence that wages—if you look at average hourly earnings, they appear to be moderating, not so yet from the other wage measures."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we’ll be getting the employment compensation index measurement, I think, on Friday, I guess."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, but we do think, though, that the labor market can adjust because of the huge overhang of job openings, of excess demand, really."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"There should be able to be an adjustment that would have lower than—perhaps lower-than-expected increases in unemployment—lower than would be expected in the ordinary course of events because the level—the ratio of, of vacancies to unemployed is just out of keeping with historical experience."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,And that suggests that this time could be different.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,Edward Lawrence.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,EDWARD LAWRENCE.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thanks, Mr. Chairman."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,Edward Lawrence from Fox Business.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,So you said that the path may be narrowed to avoiding a recession.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"So how, how close are we to a recession?"
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"And then how do forecasts of possible recession from banks and economists, how does that make a soft landing you’ve talked about more difficult?"
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"So as, as I mentioned, it doesn’t seem that the U.S. economy is in recession right now."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I think you do see weakening, some slowdown—let’s put it that way— in growth."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,And you see it across some of the categories that I mentioned.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"But there’s also just the very strong data coming out of the labor market, still."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, overall, you would say that, in all probability, demand is still strong, and, and the economy is still on track to continue to grow this year."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,That really needs to happen.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s not something we can avoid doing.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,We need to be confident that inflation is going to get back down to mandate-consistent levels.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, as I mentioned, we need to see inflation coming down."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,And that’s a very important one because it adjusts for compensation—composition.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I’d say you—and also, anecdotally, you hear much—the sort of level of concern on the part of businesses that they simply can’t find workers is probably down a little bit from what it was, say, for example, late in the latter parts of last year."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,So there’s a feeling that the labor market is moving back into balance.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"If you look at—if you look at job openings or quits, you see them moving sideways or perhaps a little bit down."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,But it’s only the beginning of an adjustment.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"But I think most—also, if you look at—I mean, once you start citing these things, you can’t stop."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"If you look at the household survey, you see much lower job creation, and the household survey can be quite volatile, but it has no jobs created in the last three months."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,So that might be a signal that job creation’s actually a little bit slower than we’re seeing in the—in the establishment survey.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we’re—you know, we’re going to be watching that carefully."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"So executive summary [is]: I would say there’s some evidence that labor demand may be slowing a bit—labor supply, not so much."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,That may be related to yet another big wave of COVID.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,And there’s evidence that that’s the case.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,But—So we’re not seeing much in the way of labor supply.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"Nonetheless, I would say some, some progress on demand and supply getting back in alignment."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,NICOLE GOODKIND.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,And then how much weakness would you be willing to accept before you think about pausing rate cuts?
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I think we’re looking—we’re going to be looking at, at inflation as well."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,We have been disappointed that labor force participation really hasn’t moved up since January.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"But I have to admit, I don’t think I would do that again."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,Let’s go to Mark for the last question.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"We—you know, ultimately, the situation evolved in a highly unexpected way for all of us."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’ve seen the very beginnings of perhaps a slight lessening in the—in the tightness of the labor market, but it would only be the beginnings."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, and I mentioned that, that—I also said that our goal is to bring inflation down and have a so-called soft landing, by which I mean a landing that doesn’t require a significant increase, a really significant increase in unemployment."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,We’re trying to achieve that.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"I have said, on many occasions, that we understand that’s going to be quite challenging and that it’s got more challenging over recent months."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,Kyle.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,KYLE CAMPBELL.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thanks, Chair Powell."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,Kyle Campbell with American Banker.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,The FOMC has historically tried to avoid the kind of rapid monetary policy tightening that has happened so far this year.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"How concerned are you that the rate hikes that we’ve seen thus far might increase risks to financial stability not just domestically, but globally?"
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mean, there are precedents for the FOMC moving very quickly— for example, in 1994, and in 1980, even more so."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,So we’ve been known to do that when it’s the appropriate thing to do.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"And this year, it clearly is."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"I would say that, given how quickly we’ve moved, I’m gratified that while—that, basically, markets have been working."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,They’ve been orderly.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, going forward, what we’ve seen is a—is a slowing in spending, as I mentioned."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"There’s been some volatility, but that’s only to be expected."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,And I think the public will see that as well.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,And I’ve explained why that is the case.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"But the other side of that is, as all these jobs get created and people go back to work and unemployment is so low, I think you could, in principle, you could see it coming back down pretty significantly."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"And that would also, by the way, take pressure off of inflation because it’s that gap—it’s the gap between actual unemployment and the—and the natural rate that really is relevant for, you know, the negative slack we have in the economy with the overtight labor market."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,So if you were to—you wouldn’t observe this.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s an unobservable, but you could actually be seeing inflationary pressures coming down if that does happen."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,And we don’t—we don’t control that.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"But that’s something that, logically, if the pandemic and the disorder in the labor market caused the natural rate to move up, then as the labor market settles down, in principle, you should see it move back down."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,Jeff.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,JEFF COX.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you, Chair Powell."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,Jeff Cox from CNBC.com.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,Just a question about—hate to keep banging the drum about recession.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"But most of the polls that we’re seeing now from the public, people believe that we’re already in a recession or heading for one— economists, pretty much the same thing."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"They’re being told by folks like you and the Administration that we’re not in a recession, we’re not heading for a recession—frankly, coming from the same people who told them inflation was transitory, telling them now that we’re not heading for a recession."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,So what would you tell the public to reassure them now that you feel confident in your forecast going forward and the Fed is ready to respond to a—to a potential downturn in the economy?
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"No, all I’ve really said is I don’t think it’s likely that the U.S. economy’s in a recession now."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s, it’s because you do see a very strong labor market."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,But I would say it must have moved up materially.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"For a financial stability perspective, you know, asset values are down, which in some—in some sense lowers vulnerabilities."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,Many asset values have come down.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"We understand how painful it is, particularly for people who are living paycheck to paycheck and spend most of that paycheck on necessities, such as food and gas and heating their homes and clothing and things like that."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"We do understand that, that those people suffer the most."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"Middle-class and better-off people have some resources, where they can absorb these things."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"But people, many people, don’t have those resources."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, you know, we—it is our job."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,It is our institutional role.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"We are assigned uniquely and unconditionally the obligation of, of providing price stability to the American people."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,And we’re going to use our tools to do that.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"As I mentioned, there will be some, in all likelihood, some softening in labor market conditions."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,We need growth to slow to below potential growth.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,We don’t want to—we don’t want this to be bigger than it needs to be.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, ultimately, if you think about the medium and longer term, price stability is the thing that, that makes the whole economy work."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s what can—it can give us a strong labor market and wages that aren’t being eaten up by high inflation.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"If you talk to people—again, people who are making, you know, wages, relatively low wages— they’re the ones who are suffering the most from inflation."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"So it’s all the more reason why we need to move, move on this."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you very much.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,And a lot of this might hit in 2023.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I guess the first thing I would say to, to every household is that we know that inflation is too high."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s when they’re really high that you would worry that they’re—that they’re vulnerable to a fall, actually."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,What would you say to individuals or households who may yet lose their jobs in this tightening cycle in the fight against inflation as they try to translate what Fed policy means to them in this complicated economic landscape?
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,I think you’ve got a well-capitalized banking system.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,I think you have—households are generally in about as strong as financial shape as they’ve been in a very long time or perhaps ever given the money that’s on people’s balance sheets.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"So you have a pretty—from a financial stability standpoint, you have a pretty decent picture."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"Now, the macroeconomic, there are plenty of macroeconomic issues that don’t rise to the level of financial stability concerns."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"By financial stability, you know, we think of that as things that might undermine the working of the financial system, so big, serious things."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"That’s not to say that people at the lower end of the income spectrum aren’t, aren’t suffering, because they are."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,They’re suffering from high inflation.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"They’re going to the—to the grocery store and finding that, in many cases, their paycheck doesn’t cover the food they’re accustomed to buying."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’re seeing actual, you know, real declines in food consumption."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, it’s very concerning."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s very unfortunate.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,And that’s why we’re—we’re really committed to bringing down inflation—one of the reasons.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,MARK HAMRICK.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,Mark Hamrick with Bankrate.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"I can remember when you held your first news conference, and you vowed to be a very plainspoken Chairman, and we’re thinking today about the impacts of Fed policy on individuals as well."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,We can never know where these star variables are in real time with any confidence.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"Of course, I would add that we don’t know it."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,And my own instinct is that the natural rate of unemployment is higher.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,So there was the famous one in 2013.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"There’s what happened at the December ’18 meeting, where, you know, markets can ignore developments around the balance sheet for years on end and then suddenly react very sharply."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,So we just had developed a practice of moving predictably and doing it in steps and things like that.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,It was just like that’s how we did it.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,And so we did it that way this time.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"We were—we were careful to, to take steps and communicate and all that kind of thing."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"Yes, we were trying to avoid a tantrum because they can be quite destructive."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,They can tighten financial conditions and knock the economy off kilter.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, when it happens, you have to—really, in both ’13 and ’18, it really had consequences for the real economy, you know, two, three, four months later."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,So we were trying to avoid that.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,That was part of it.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"Again, I don’t think that’s—the real issue of 2020 and ’21 was just trying to understand what was happening with the reopening economy."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"That, that was where the big uncertainty was."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, our view was that these supply-side issues would get better: that people would go back to work, that labor force participation would come back, everyone would get vaccinated, schools would open, kids would be in school, and labor force participation would jump back up."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s what we were—that was very broadly thought to be the case: these supply-side issues would get solved reasonably quickly.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,And they just haven’t.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,They still haven’t.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I think we learned—there’ve been multiple taper tantrums, right?"
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"So that’s really the learning, I think, is around how complicated these supply-side issues can be."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,Where did that fit into all those decisions?
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, maybe the learning is that leave a little more flexibility than that."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,But did it matter in the end?
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, we—if you look at—I really don’t think it did."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,I’m not sure it would’ve mattered if we’d been raising rates three months earlier.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,Does anybody think that would’ve made a big difference?
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mean, lots of central banks were raising rates three months earlier, and it didn’t matter."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mean, this is a—this is a global phenomenon that’s happening now—admittedly, different in the United States, but anyway."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,Nancy.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,GREG ROBB.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,Can I follow up?
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"Sorry about that, Greg."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,GREG ROBB.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"Just a lot of people talk about that time, and they talk about a taper tantrum."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,I know you haven’t talked about it too much but that you were worried at the time about repeating that taper tantrum that you had experienced as a Governor.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,So was that part of that?
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"We haven’t seen this before in a long, long time."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"And so that’s really, you know, what accounts for the pace at which we moved, and we did."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"When inflation changed direction, really, in October, we’ve moved quickly since then."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,What we have right now doesn’t seem like that.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,And the real reason is that the labor market is just sending such a signal of economic strength that it makes you really question the GDP data.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, again, that’s not a decision that we—that we make."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,And we won’t—we won’t reach a conclusion one way or another on that.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,Simon.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,SIMON RABINOVITCH.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you very much.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,Simon Rabinovitch with the Economist.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,You said that some softening in the labor market is needed.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"Within the Fed, there are staff economists who’ve argued that NAIRU, the noninflationary rate of unemployment, might be as high as 5 to 6 percent right now, which obviously is a lot higher than the current rate of 3.6."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,What’s your assessment of NAIRU?
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,Is that something that came up in discussion with the Committee?
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I think, broadly, a lot of economists think that the—that the natural rate of unemployment will have moved up to some significant extent above where we think it was before."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"And the reason is there’s—it’s the usual matching issue, where matching has become less effective, and that kind of thing when you have the kind of turbulent downturn and the big switches in demand from services to goods and all that."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,So it could be higher.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,And it just doesn’t—this just doesn’t seem like that now.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"As I mentioned, though, you know, if you think about what an inflation—sorry, what a recession really is, it’s a broad-based decline across many industries that, you know, is sustained for more than a couple of months, and there are a bunch of specific tests in it."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"We would look at the data tomorrow—and no doubt, we’ll look at it very carefully—and draw whatever implications we can."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,So that wouldn’t be something we’d do.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,I think people would agree.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"But before then, inflation was coming down month by month."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, we kind of thought we had the story—probably had the story right."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"But then, I think in October, you started to see a range of data that said “No."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"This is a much stronger economy and much higher inflation than we’ve been thinking.” And, again, we’ve pivoted, and here we are."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,GREG ROBB.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,I don’t think I would do that again.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,Nancy.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,Nancy Marshall-Genzer with Marketplace.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"Chair Powell, I just want to pin you down a little bit more on the issue of recession."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"So if we get a negative GDP number tomorrow for the second quarter, would the Fed consider the U.S. in a recession?"
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"And just remind us, what is your definition for the start of a recession?"
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,So the Fed doesn’t make a—doesn’t make a judgment on that.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, we’re focused on the dual mandate and using our tools to achieve maximum employment and price stability."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,We don’t—we don’t say “There is now a recession” and that kind of thing.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I ask because there are lags in the impact of monetary policy, as you mentioned."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"The truth is, though, we, we think that demand is moderating."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,Are they moving at a pace you would expect?
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"So that’s—even though that’s now six weeks old, I guess, that’s—that’s the most recent reading."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"Of course, we’ll update that reading at the—at the September meeting in eight weeks."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,So that’s how we’re thinking about it.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"As I mentioned, as it relates to September, I said that another unusually large increase could be appropriate, but that’s not a decision we’re making now."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s one that we’ll make based on the data we see.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,And we’re going to be making decisions meeting by meeting.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"We think it’s—we think it’s time to just go to a meeting-by-meeting basis and not provide, you know, the kind of clear guidance that we had provided on the way to neutral."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.

2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,NICK TIMIRAOS.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"Chair Powell, you’ve said that your policy works through influencing expectations and that policy needs to be at least moderately restrictive, which means you need financial conditions to stay tight."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,Futures market pricing currently implies you will raise rates this year along the lines of your June SEP but then lower them a few months later next year.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,Are these expectations consistent with the need to keep financial conditions tight in order to moderate purchasing power and bring inflation back to 2 percent?
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,So I’m going to start by pointing out that it’s very hard to say with any confidence in normal times—in normal times—what the economy’s going to be doing in 6 or 12 months.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"And to try to predict what the appropriate monetary policy would respond— response would be—of course, we do that in the SEP, but, nonetheless, you’ve got to take any estimates of what rates will be next year with a grain of salt, because there’s so much uncertainty."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, then, people wrote down 50 basis points higher than that for 2023."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,These are not normal times.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I think the median [federal funds rate] for the end of this year, the median would’ve been between 3¼ and 3½ [percent]."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,I think the best—I think the Committee broadly feels that we need to get policy to at least to a moderately restrictive level.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,Are we seeing the slowdown that we—the slowdown in economic activity—that we think we need?
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,And there’s some evidence that we are at this time.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"Of course, we’ll be looking at labor market conditions."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we’ll be asking whether we see the alignment between supply and demand getting better, getting closer."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"Of course, we’ll be looking closely at inflation."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,You mentioned headline and core.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"Our mandate is for headline, of course; it’s not for core."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"But we look at core because core is, is actually a better indicator of headline and of all inflation going forward."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,So we’ll be—we’ll be looking at both.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we’ll be looking at them for—at those both, really—for what they’re saying about the outlook rather than just simply for, for what they say."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,But we’ll be asking: Do we see inflationary pressures declining?
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,Do we see actual readings of inflation coming down?
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, in light of all that data, the question we’ll be asking is whether the stance of policy we have is sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation back down to our 2 percent target."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"And it’s also worth noting that these rate hikes have been large, and they’ve come—they’ve come quickly."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,And it’s likely that their full effect has not been felt by the economy.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"So there’s probably some additional tightening, significant additional tightening, in the pipeline."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,So where are we going with this?
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,And maybe the best data point for that would be what we wrote down in our SEP at the—at the June meeting.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, we’ll be looking at the incoming data, as I mentioned, and that’ll start with economic activity."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"There’s significantly more uncertainty now about the path ahead than I think there ordinarily is, and, ordinarily, it’s quite high."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"Since then, inflation has come in higher; economic activity has come in weaker than expected."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"So it’s hard to deal with hypotheticals, but I just would say this."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"We, you know, we would look at both, and we would ask—we’d be asking ourselves, are we confident that inflation is on a path down to 2 percent?"
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s really the question.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we’ll be making—you know, our policy stance will be set at a level, ultimately, at which we are confident that inflation is going to be moving down to 2 percent."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,So you would—it would depend on a lot of things.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"Of course, as I mentioned, core inflation is a better predictor of inflation going forward."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,Headline inflation tends to be volatile.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, in ordinary times, you, you look through volatile moves in commodities."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"The problem with the current situation is that, that if you have a sustained period of supply shocks, those can actually start to undermine or to work—to work on de-anchoring inflation expectations."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,The public doesn’t distinguish between core and headline inflation in their thinking.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"So it’s something we have to take into consideration in our policymaking even though our tools don’t really work on, on some aspects of this, which are the supply-side issues."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,Steve.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,STEVE LIESMAN.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"Steve Liesman, CNBC."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thanks for taking my question, Mr. Chairman."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"You kind of alluded to this earlier, but I wonder in the event that you see several months of very weak headline inflation numbers because oil prices are coming down so much, but core inflation continues to be strong or even picks up, I wonder how you would think about that."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, again, I would—the best data, the only data point I have for you really is the June SEP, which I think is just the most recent thing that the Committee’s done."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"Jeanna Smialek, New York Times."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Chair Powell."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"But at the same time, I would say that’s probably the best estimate of where the Committee’s thinking is still, which is that we would get to a moderately restrictive level by the end of this year—by which I mean somewhere between 3 and 3½ percent—and that when the Committee sees further rate increases in 2023, as I mentioned, we’ll update that, of course, at the September meeting."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,But that’s really the best I can do on that.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,NICK TIMIRAOS.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,You said inflation had been a little bit hotter than anticipated.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,Has your view of the terminal rate changed since June?
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I wouldn’t say it was—I think we didn’t expect a good reading, but this one—this one was even worse than expected, I would say."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"I don’t talk about my own personal estimate of, of what the terminal rate would be."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,I do—I will write down that in—it’s going to evolve.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"Obviously, it has evolved over the course—I think, for all participants, it has evolved over the course of the year as we learn how persistent inflation’s going to be."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"And by the time of the September meeting, we will have seen two more CPI readings and two more labor market readings and a significant amount of readings about economic activity and perhaps geopolitical developments, who knows."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,It’ll be—it’ll be a lot.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s an eight-week intermeeting period, so I think we’ll see quite a lot of data."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,And we’ll make our decision at that meeting based on that data.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,Jeanna.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,JEANNA SMIALEK.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks for taking our questions.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,So what are we going to be looking at?
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,We also said that we expect ongoing rate hikes will be appropriate and that we’ll make decisions meeting by meeting.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,That’ll continue to be our overarching focus.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"In June, the 12-month change in the consumer price index came in above expectations at 9.1 percent, and the change in the core CPI was 5.9 percent."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"Notwithstanding the recent slowdown in overall economic activity, aggregate demand appears to remain strong, supply constraints have been larger and longer lasting than anticipated, and price pressures are evident across a broad range of goods and services."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"Although prices for some commodities have turned down recently, the earlier surge in prices of crude oil and other commodities that resulted from Russia’s war on Ukraine has boosted prices for gasoline and food, creating additional upward pressure on inflation."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,The Fed’s monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"My colleagues and I are acutely aware that high inflation imposes significant hardship, especially on those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"We are highly attentive to the risks high inflation poses to both sides of our mandate, and we are strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent objective."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"At today’s meeting, the Committee raised the target range for the federal funds rate by ¾ of a percentage point, bringing the target range to 2¼ to 2½ percent."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we’re continuing the process of significantly reducing the size of our balance sheet, which plays an important role in firming the stance of monetary policy."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"Over coming months, we will be looking for compelling evidence that inflation is moving down, consistent with inflation returning to 2 percent."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,We anticipate that ongoing increases in the target range for the federal funds rate will be appropriate; the pace of those increases will continue to depend on the incoming data and the evolving outlook for the economy.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,Today’s increase is the—in the target range is the second 75 basis point increase in as many meetings.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"While another unusually large increase could be appropriate at our next meeting, that is a decision that will depend on the data we get between now and then."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,We will continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting and communicating—and communicate our thinking as clearly as possible.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"As the stance of monetary policy tightens further, it likely will become appropriate to slow the pace of increases while we assess how our cumulative policy adjustments are affecting the economy and inflation."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,Our overarching focus is using our tools to bring demand into better balance with supply in order to bring inflation back down to our 2 percent goal and to keep longer-term inflation expectations well anchored.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,Making appropriate monetary policy in this uncertain environment requires a recognition that the economy often involves—evolves in unexpected ways.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"Inflation has obviously surprised to the upside over the past year, and further surprises could be in store."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"Over the 12 months ending in May, total PCE prices rose 6.3 percent; excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 4.7 percent."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,We therefore will need to be nimble in responding to incoming data and the evolving outlook.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,Inflation remains well above our longer-run goal of 2 percent.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"Labor demand is very strong, while labor supply remains subdued, with the labor force participation rate little changed since January."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"Transcript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference July 27, 2022 CHAIR POWELL."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,Good afternoon.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"My colleagues and I are strongly committed to bringing inflation back down, and we’re moving expeditiously to do so."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,We have both the tools we need and the resolve it will take to restore price stability on behalf of American families and businesses.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,The economy and the country have been through a lot over the past two and a half years and have proved resilient.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,It is essential that we bring inflation down to our 2 percent goal if we are to have a sustained period of strong labor market conditions that benefit all.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"From the standpoint of our congressional mandate to promote maximum employment and price stability, the current picture is plain to see: The labor market is extremely tight, and inflation is much too high."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"Against this backdrop, today the FOMC raised its policy interest rate by ¾ of a percentage point and anticipates that ongoing increases in the target range for the federal funds rate will be appropriate."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"In addition, we are continuing the process of significantly reducing the size of our balance sheet."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,And I’ll have more to say about today’s monetary policy actions after briefly reviewing economic developments.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,Recent indicators of spending and production have softened.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"Growth in consumer spending has slowed significantly, in part reflecting lower real disposable income and tighter financial conditions."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"Activity in the housing sector has weakened, in part reflecting higher mortgage rates."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"And after a strong increase in the first quarter, business fixed investment also looks to have declined in the second quarter."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"Despite these developments, the labor market has remained extremely tight, with the unemployment rate near a 50-year low, job vacancies near historical highs, and wage growth elevated."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"Over the past three months, employment rose by an average of 375,000 jobs per month—down from the average pace seen earlier in the year, but still robust."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"Improvements in labor market conditions have been widespread, including for workers at the lower end of the wage distribution as well as for African Americans and Hispanics."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"Overall, the continued strength of the labor market suggests that underlying aggregate demand remains solid."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,And we will strive to avoid adding uncertainty in what is already an extraordinarily challenging and uncertain time.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,We are highly attentive to inflation risks and determined to take the measures necessary to return inflation to our 2 percent longer-run goal.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,This process is likely to involve a period of below- trend economic growth and some softening in labor market conditions.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,You mentioned the—the June meeting.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"We, we had said many times that we were prepared to move aggressively, more aggressively, if inflation continued to disappoint."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"And that’s why we did move to a more aggressive pace at the June meeting, as we said we would do."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"At this meeting, we continued at that more aggressive pace, as inflation has continued to disappoint, in the form of the June CPI reading."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,Colby.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,COLBY SMITH.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you so much for taking our questions.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,Colby Smith with the Financial Times.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"As the Committee considers the policy path forward, how will it weigh the expected decline in headline inflation, which might come as a result of the drop in commodity prices, against the fact that we are likely to see some persistence in core readings, in particular?"
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"And given that potential tension and signs of, you know, any kind of activity weakening here, how has the Committee’s thinking changed on how far into restrictive territory rates might need to go?"
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,So I guess I’d start by saying we’ve been saying we would move expeditiously to get to the range of neutral.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,And I think we’ve done that now.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’re at—we’re at 2.25 to 2.5 [percent], and that’s right in the range of what we think is neutral."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"So the question is, how are we thinking about the path forward?"
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,So one thing that hasn’t changed is that—won’t change—is that our focus is continuing to—is going to continue to be on using our tools to bring demand back into better balance with supply in order to bring inflation back down.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,There was very broad support for the move that we made.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,That was not the case at this meeting.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"I’d say that we wouldn’t hesitate to, to make an even larger move than we did today if the Committee were to conclude that that was—that that were appropriate."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,So we did judge that a 75 basis point increase was the right magnitude in light of the data and in the context of the ongoing increases in the policy rate that we’ve been making.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,But such outcomes are likely necessary to restore price stability and to set the stage for achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the longer run.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"To conclude: We understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,Everything we do is in service to our public mission.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum-employment and price-stability goals.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,I look forward to your questions.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,Let’s start with Rachel.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"Earlier this week, the President said, “We are not going to be in a recession.” So I have two questions off of that."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,RACHEL SIEGEL.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks for taking our questions.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,Rachel Siegel from the Washington Post.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,I’m wondering if you can walk us through your thinking around the decision not to go for a full percentage point increase.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"We saw a ramp-up after the May CPI report came in hotter than usual and then, obviously, the June figure did, too."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,Was there any discussion of a stronger hike at this meeting?
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,Yes.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,Sure.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Chair Powell."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,Do you share the President’s confidence in not being in a recession?
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"Is it a bright line, sir, where, where contraction of the economy would be a turning point in policy?"
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Chair Powell."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,Hi.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"Catarina Saraiva, Bloomberg News."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,I wanted to ask a little bit more about the 75 basis points versus 50 versus 25.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"Can you talk a little bit about what, what kind of goes into your thinking for, you know, making the decision on how much to raise rates and, you know, just talking about a very large amount that you alluded to?"
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,Could that possibly be 100 basis points?
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"And then, kind of along those lines, is there any sort of weakness in the economy, outside of inflation measures, that would lead you to slow your hiking pace?"
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,So I’m going to—I’m going to take that as a question about the next meeting and thereafter.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, as I mentioned, we’re going to be looking at all of those things: activity, labor market, inflation."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,And we’re going to be thinking about our policy stance and where does it really need to be.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I also mentioned that, as this process—now that we’re at neutral—as the process goes on, at some point, it will be appropriate to, to slow down."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we haven’t made a decision when that point is, but intuitively that makes sense, right?"
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’ve been front-end-loading these very large rate increases, and now we’re getting closer to where we need to be."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,So that’s how we’re thinking about it.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"And in terms of September, we’re going—we’re going to watch the data and the evolving outlook very carefully and factor in everything and make a decision in September about what to do."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,And I’m not really going to provide any specific guidance about what that might be.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,CATARINA SARAIVA.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, you know, but I mentioned that we might do another unusually large rate increase."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,Catarina.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,And I’m proud of what we did.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"But you tend to take first GDP reports, I think, with a—with a grain of salt."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, of course, it’s something we’ll be looking at."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,Victoria.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,VICTORIA GUIDA.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Chair Powell."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,Victoria Guida with Politico.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,I wanted to ask about the new conflict-of-interest rules that you all rolled out.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,Some senators have written asking for those rules to have more teeth and to have sort of more transparency about Fed’s financial—the Fed officials’ financial activity.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"I was wondering if you could speak to that and whether you intend on, you know, toughening those rules in any way."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"So those are—those are the toughest rules in place, you know, at any comparable institution that I’m aware of."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"We think—you know, we’ve thought about this carefully, and we put them in place."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we’re building the infrastructure so that—so that, you know, the enforcement will be tight, that, actually, you won’t be able to make trades unless they’re precleared."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"And the amount of trades you make, they’ll have to be 45 days or more before any FOMC meeting."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s just—I think we’ve really, you know, created a very strong and robust set of rules that will, you know, support public trust in the institution."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, again, we’re just now—the system is just now up and running."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,And a lot of—a lot of work and judgment goes into that.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,But that’s not a decision that we’ve made at all.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I think you can still think of the, the destination as broadly in line with the September—sorry, the June SEP, because it’s only six weeks old."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,That is because we think it’s a better measure.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,They will come together eventually.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,Or is demand still greater than supply—too much greater than supply that you need to do significantly more?
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,The typical gap was really about 25 basis points for a very long time.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"And if it went—if it got to 40 basis points, that would be very noticeable."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,And now it’s—now it’s much larger than that because of the things I mentioned.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we’ll be watching both, but, again, the one that we think is the best measure always has been PCE, at least since I think we—some 20 plus years ago—moved to PCE."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,Michael McKee.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHAEL MCKEE.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"I’d like to weave a couple of things together, Mr. Chairman."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,Michael McKee from Bloomberg TV and Radio.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,You said that the destination pretty much remains the same in terms of your end-of-the-year target.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,But where are you in the journey?
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,We’ve now seen the federal stimulus programs end.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"You mentioned consumer spending, business investment have slowed."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, second, how would or would not a recession change policy?"
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"But remember, we do target PCE."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we are—you know, we’re going to be guided by the data."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, we—given the importance in the public eye of CPI, we are calling it out and noticing it and everything like that."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,And so that accounts for a lot of the difference.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"And sometimes, sometimes SEPs can get old really quick."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think in this one—this one I would say is probably, probably the best guide we have as to where the Committee thinks it needs to get at the end of the year and then into next year."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,So I would point you to that.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,Chris.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,CHRISTOPHER RUGABER.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,Hi.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"Chris Rugaber, Associated Press."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"I wanted to ask about right now, there’s a sort of growing gap between the Fed’s preferred measure of inflation, the PCE, PCE index, and the one that’s followed by the public, the CPI, of course."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"How do you expect to handle this divergence if the PCE starts to come down enough for you to consider slowing rate hikes, even if the public is still seeing much higher CPI ratings?"
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"So it’s an interesting, interesting situation."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"Of course, we’ve, we’ve long used PCE because we think it’s just better at capturing the inflation that people actually face in their lives."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,And I think that that view is pretty widely understood.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"That said, the public really reads about CPI."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"And the difference really is because the CPI has higher weights on things like food, gasoline, motor vehicles, and housing than the PCE index does."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"However, over time, they tend to come together."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s a large economy.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"I don’t—I mean, I would say, generally, the GDP numbers do have a tendency to be revised pretty significantly."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we think that in the—we don’t see it as a tradeoff with, with the employment mandate."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,We see it as a way to facilitate the sustained achievement of the employment mandate in the longer term.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,Howard.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,HOWARD SCHNEIDER.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,Howard Schneider with Reuters.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"Particularly in regard to expectations, it’s been said the last few months that the risks of doing too little outweighed the lists—the risks of doing too much."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,Does that remain the bias?
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we’re trying to do just the right amount, right?"
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,We’re not—we’re not trying to have a recession.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,And we don’t think we have to.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"We think that there’s a path for us to be able to bring inflation down while sustaining a strong labor market, as I mentioned, along with—in all likelihood—some, some softening in labor market conditions."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"So that is— that’s what we’re trying to achieve, and we continue to think that there’s a path to that."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"We know that the path has, has clearly narrowed, really based on events that are outside of our control."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,And it may narrow further.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, you know, I do think—as I said just now—that restoring price stability is just something that we have to do."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"So that’s something we see as, as something that we simply must do."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"That’s not going to happen without, without restoring price stability."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"We want to get back to that, but that’s not happening."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"We all want to get back to the kind of labor market we had before the pandemic, where differences between, you know, racial and gender differences and that kind of thing were at historic minimums, where participation was high, where inflation was low."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,Or is there some amount of contraction of the economy the Committee would be willing to abide in its effort to reduce inflation?
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s just—it’s just that it’s very hard—it’s very hard to cumulate [to an estimate of] U.S. GDP.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, as I—as I mentioned, we think it’s necessary to have growth slow down."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"And growth is going to be slowing down this year for a couple of reasons, one of which is that you’re coming off of the very high growth of the reopening year of 2021."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,You’re also seeing tighter monetary policy.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,And you should see some slowing.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,We actually think we need a period of growth below potential in order to create some slack so that—so that the supply side can catch up.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"There, there isn’t an option to fail to do that because that is the thing that enables you to have a strong labor market over time."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"We also think that there will be, in all likelihood, some softening in labor market conditions."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,And we think that they’re probably necessary if we were to have—to get inflation—if we were to be able to get inflation back down on a path to 2 percent and ultimately get there.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,STEVE LIESMAN.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,The question was whether you see a recession coming and how that might or might not change policy.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we’re going to be—again, we’re going to be focused on getting inflation back down."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we—as I’ve said on other occasions, price stability is really the bedrock of the economy."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,We can’t have a strong labor market without price stability for an extended period of time.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,And those are things that we expect.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"Without restoring price stability, you won’t be able, over the medium and longer term, to actually have a strong—a sustained period of very strong labor market conditions."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,And nothing works in the economy without price stability.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,HOWARD SCHNEIDER.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"And the reason is, there are just too many areas of the economy that are—that are performing, you know, too well."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, of course, I would point to the labor market, in particular."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"As I mentioned, it’s true that growth is slowing for reasons that we understand."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"Really, the growth was extraordinarily high last year, 5½ percent."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,We would have expected growth to slow.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,There’s also more slowing going on now.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"But if you look at the labor market, you’ve got growth—I think, payroll jobs averaging 450,000 per month."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"That’s a remarkably strong level for, for this state of, of affairs."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,All of the wage measures that we track are running very strong.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"So this is a very strong labor market, and it’s just not consistent with— you know, 2.7 million people hired in the first half of the year."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"It doesn’t make sense that the economy would be in recession with, with this kind of thing happening."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,So I don’t think the U.S. economy’s in recession right now.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,NEIL IRWIN.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,GDP?
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,GDP tomorrow?
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, of course, we serve both sides of the dual mandate, but we actually see them as well aligned on this."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,So I don’t—I do not think the U.S. is currently in a recession.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,The unemployment rate at near a 50-year low at 3.6 percent.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,Will the GDP reading tomorrow affect that judgment one way or the other?
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"But as a—as a follow-on to that, given the uncertainty and that sort of paradoxical flow of data you’ve been getting, if you’re going to make a mistake, would you rather make the mistake on doing too much, raising too much, than raising too little?"
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,And has your assessment of the risk of recession changed any in recent weeks?
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,We’re trying not to make a mistake.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,Let me put it this way: We do see that there are two-sided risks.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"There would be the risk of doing too much and, you know, imposing more of a downturn on the economy than, than was necessary, but the risk—the risk of doing too little and leaving the economy with this entrenched inflation, it only raises the cost."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"If you fail to deal with it in the near term, it only raises the cost of, of dealing with it later to the extent people start to see it as just part of their economic lives."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,They start to factor high inflation into their decisions—when that—on a sustained basis.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"When that starts to really happen, and we don’t think that’s happened yet, but when that starts to happen, it just gets that much harder."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"Ah, haven’t seen it, and, and we’ll just have to see what it says."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,So I really do think that it’s important that we—that we address this now and get it done.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,Neil.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,NEIL IRWIN.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thanks, Chair Powell."
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,Neil Irwin from Axios.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,And the pain will be that much greater.
2022-07-27,Press Conf - Full Text,"To build a little bit on what Steve was asking, do you believe the United States is currently in a recession?"
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"Do the odds now favor, given where you are and where you’re going with interest rates, favor a recession?"
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mean, if we were to fail to do that, that would be the thing that would be most painful for the people that we serve."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"So for now, that has to be our overarching focus, and you see that, I think, in the SEP, in the levels of rates that we’ll be moving to reasonably quickly, assuming things turn out roughly in line with the SEP."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,So that’s how we think about it.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHAEL MCKEE.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,Mike.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,We can’t fail to do that.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"In a world of euphemisms that we live in here, with “below-trend growth” and “modest increase in unemployment,” I’m wondering if I can ask you a couple of direct questions for the American people."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, of course, we are focused on the thing I started with, which is getting inflation back down to 2 percent."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’re forecasting growth well below that, and most forecasters are."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"And that’s a good thing, because that means the economy will be more resistant to a significant downturn."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,But you’re right—there’s certainly a possibility that growth can be stronger than that.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"We think of trend as being about 1.8 percent, or in that range."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"Now, the data sort of are showing that growth is going to be below trend this year."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"The states are very flush with cash, so there’s good reason to think that this will continue to be a reasonably strong economy."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"There’s still very significant savings out there, although not as much at the lower end of the income spectrum—but still, some savings out there to support growth."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,So we’re having an effect on interest-sensitive spending.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think—so all of that’s happening, but you’re right, and we’ve said this: This is a strong, robust economy."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think, through exchange rates, we’re having an effect on exports and imports."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"You’re right, of course—the labor market, in particular, has been very strong."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"But there are—the sectors of the economy that are most interest rate sensitive are certainly showing the effects of our tightening, and, of course, the obvious example is housing, where you see declining activity of all different kinds and house price increases moving down."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,People have savings on their balance sheet from the period when they couldn’t spend and where they were getting government transfers.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we certainly don’t hope, we certainly haven’t given up the idea that we can have a relatively modest increase in unemployment."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,Is that acceptable job loss?
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mean, again, our really tight focus now continues to be ongoing rate increases to get the policy rate up where it needs to be."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, as I said, you can look at this SEP as today’s estimate of where we think those rates would be."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s hard to hypothetically deal with that question.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"But how will you know, or will you know, if you’ve gone too far?"
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHAEL MCKEE.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"Nonetheless, we need to complete this task."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, what we need to do is get rates up to the point where we’re putting meaningful downward pressure on inflation, and that’s what we’re doing."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,There isn’t.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,I wish there were a painless way to do that.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"And if we want to set ourselves up, really light the way to another period of a very strong labor market, we have got to get inflation behind us."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’re never going to say that there are too many people working, but the real point is this: Inflation—what we hear from people when we meet with them is that they really are suffering from inflation."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"But I think that’s, so that is something that we think we need to have, and we think we need to have softer labor market conditions as well."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"So that’s a slower, that’s a very slow level of growth, and it could give rise to increases in unemployment."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think the median was 1.2, also well below."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,And then below trend next year.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,So that’s very slow growth.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"So the median forecast, I think, this year among my colleagues and me was 0.2 percent growth."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think that there’s a very high likelihood that we’ll have a period of what I’ve mentioned is below-trend growth, by which I mean much lower growth, and we’re seeing that now."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,So I don’t know what the odds are.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"And then, given that the data you look at is backward looking, and the lags in your policy are forward looking, and you don’t know what they are, how will you know, or will you know, if you’ve gone too far?"
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,Four point four percent unemployment is about 1.3 million jobs.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"Why is the economy, in your view, so resilient, and does it mean that we might need a possibly higher terminal rate?"
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,I wanted to ask about the balance sheet.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"Chair Powell, you talked about some ways the higher interest rates are affecting the economy, but we’ve also seen a resilient labor market with durable consumption, strong corporate profits, and I’m wondering what your story is on the resilience of the economy."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think a number of things might affect that decision, really."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,Will conditions in the housing market affect that decision?
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,VICTORIA GUIDA.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s just, it’s something I think we will turn to, but that time, the time for turning to it, has not come and is not close."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,I would say it’s not something we’re considering right now and not something I expect to be considering in the near term.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we, what we said, as you know, was that we would consider that once balance sheet runoff is well under way."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"Mortgage rates have gone up significantly, and I’m just wondering whether conditions there might affect your plans for how quickly you have the runoff on the MBS side."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"You all have left open the possibility that you might sell mortgage-backed securities, but we’ve seen significant slowing in the housing market."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,Victoria Guida with Politico.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,Hi.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,VICTORIA GUIDA.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,Victoria.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s how we think about it.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"If that’s the one thing you know, you know that this Committee is committed to getting to a meaningfully restrictive stance of policy and staying there until we feel confident that inflation is coming down."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s running 4.5 percent or above; you don’t need to know much more than that.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"So if you look at them together—and, as I just mentioned, if you really look at this year’s inflation, 3-, 6-, and 12-month trailing, you see inflation is running too high."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,So I think you have to—you can’t really—you never want to overreact too much to any one data point.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, if you remember, we got a surprisingly low reading in July and then a surprisingly high reading for August."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"Of course, they will evolve over time."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we, as we said at the last press conference and in between that one and this one, we said that we would make our decision based on the overall data coming in."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"The main thing is, we’re not considering that decision, and I don’t expect that we will any time soon."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,Neil.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,Craig Torres from Bloomberg.

2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,Craig.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we all, I think, are informed by what other important economies— economies that are important to the United States—are doing."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"But I will tell you, our contact is more or less ongoing, and it’s not coordination, but there’s a lot of information sharing."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"If you remember, there were coordinated cuts and raises and things like that at various times, but, really, we’re all, we’re in very different situations."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,So I don’t see—it’s hard to talk about collaboration in a world where people have very different levels of interest rates.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,It won’t be perfect.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"That is very much baked into our own forecast and our own understanding of the U.S. economy, as best we can."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mean, I can’t say that we do it perfectly, but it’s not as if we don’t think about the policy decisions—monetary policy and otherwise—the economic developments that are taking place in major economies that can have an effect on the U.S. economy."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"After all, you and your colleagues said, “Well, we started tightening in March when we were talking about interest rates in the future.” And, indeed, Treasury rates moved up, so we should have had a lot of tightening taking effect."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"The forecasts that we put together, that our staff puts together, and that we put together on our own always take all of that—try to take all of that into account."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"But we regularly discuss what we’re seeing in terms of our own economy and international spillovers, and it’s a very ongoing, constant kind of a process."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"We are in pretty regular contact, and we exchange, of course—we all serve a domestic mandate, domestic objectives—in our case, the dual mandate, maximum employment and price stability."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we, actually, my colleagues and I, a number of my FOMC colleagues and I, just got back from one of our frequent trips to Basel, Switzerland, to meet with other senior central bank officials from around the world."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,And is there much risk of overdoing it on a global level?
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,How do you think of coordination with your fellow central bankers?
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,How do you see that risk?
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"A number of commentators have come to the view, including over at the World Bank, that simultaneous global tightening around the world is, creates a risk of a global recession that’s worse than is necessary to bring inflation down."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,Neil Irwin with Axios.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,NEIL IRWIN.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we are very aware of what’s going on in other economies around the world and what that means for us, and vice versa."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,I think that shelter inflation is going to remain high for some time.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,CHRIS RUGABER.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"Just to follow, though, shelter made up such a large part of this hot CPI report that we saw."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,NICOLE GOODKIND.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"But from a sort of business cycle standpoint, this difficult correction should put the housing market back into better balance."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"As you know, we’re—it’s difficult to find lots now close enough to cities and things like that, so builders are having a hard time getting zoning and lots and workers and materials and things like that."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"There’s also, there are also longer-run issues, though, with the housing market."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I think we—so we probably, in the housing market, have to go through a correction to get back to that place."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"For the longer term, what we need is supply and demand to get better aligned so that housing prices go up at a reasonable level—at a reasonable pace—and that people can afford houses again."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"So the deceleration in housing prices that we’re seeing should help bring sort of prices more closely in line with rents and other housing market fundamentals, and that’s a good thing."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,Housing prices were going up at an unsustainably fast level.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,So there was a big imbalance between supply and demand.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,That kind of thing.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"What I’m really saying is that we’ve had a time of a red-hot housing market all over the country, where, famously, houses were selling to the first buyer at 10 percent above the ask, before even seeing the house."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"So when I say “reset,” I’m not looking at a particular, specific set of data or anything."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,I was wondering if you could elaborate on what you mean when you say “reset” and what you think it will take to actually get there.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"Now, at the end of your June press conference, you mentioned plans to reset the housing market."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"Existing home sales have fallen for seven months straight, mortgage rates are at their highest level since 2008, yet mortgage demand increased this week, and housing prices are still elevated."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"Nicole Goodkind, CNN Business."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you, Chairman Powell."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,NICOLE GOODKIND.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"Nicole, from CNN."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,We want to act aggressively now and get this job done and keep at it until it’s done.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,Do you think that there is a lag and that we will see that come down in the coming months?
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,Or do you think that there’s still this imbalance that needs to be addressed?
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’re looking for it to come down, but it’s not exactly clear when that will happen."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,Yeah.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you very much.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"So this is something that, as you can see, they’ve moved up, and we’re going to continue to watch incoming data and the evolving outlook and ask ourselves whether our policy is in the right place as we go."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,It will be enough to restore price stability.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,The path that we actually execute will be enough.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"And let me say, we’ve written down what we think is a plausible path for the federal funds rate."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,But it would be significantly positive when we get to that level.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"So you’ll have a positive [real] federal funds rate at that point, which could be 1 percent or so, but—I mean, I don’t know exactly what it would be."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"In all cases, you will get forward inflation expectations in the short term, I think, that are going to be, assuming that we’re doing our jobs appropriately, that will be significant."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,It could be—there are all kinds of different things you could pick and you get—but what you’ll get is a positive number.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,And that could be—you pick your measure.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"If the concept of high inflation becomes entrenched in people’s economic thinking about their decisions, then sort of getting back to price stability—the cost of getting back to price stability just rises, and so we want to avoid that."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"What you’re going to do is, you’re going to adjust that for some forward-looking measure of inflation."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,How restrictive?
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I’m curious, how restrictive is rates at 4.6 percent expected—is that expected to be next year?"
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"You’ve talked about the need to get real rates into positive territory, and you said earlier that policy is just moving into that territory now."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,Jean Yung with Market News.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,Hi.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,JEAN YUNG.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"Okay, we’ll go to Jean for the last question."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I think, on shelter inflation, you’ve just got to assume that it’s going to remain pretty high for a while."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"So it may take some time, so I think, hope for the best, plan for the worst."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I think if you look, when we get to—if we—let’s assume we do get to that level, which I think is likely."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,Chris Rugaber.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"But they’re not as painful as failing to restore price stability and then having to come back and do it down the road again and doing it at a time when, actually, now people have really come to expect high inflation."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,So it’s all of those things.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"To pull back from the task of doing that is, you’re just postponing—the record shows that if you postpone that, the delay is only likely to lead to more pain."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,And we have to get back to that and keep it for another long period of time.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"The United States had 2 percent inflation, didn’t move around much, and that was enormously beneficial to the public that we serve."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,We really saw that for a long time.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"In any case, we, our job is to deliver price stability, and I think—you can think of price stability as an asset that just delivers large benefits to society over a long period of time."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,But none of that is guaranteed.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hopefully, we do that by slowing the economy, and we see some softening in labor market conditions, and we see a big contribution from supply-side improvements, and things like that."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"We have to get supply and demand back into alignment, and the way we do that is by slowing the economy."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, as I mentioned, it would be nice if there were a way to just wish it away, but there isn’t."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,So how do we get rid of inflation?
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"So that’s what we’re hearing from people is, you know, very much—that inflation is really hurting."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"You don’t have a cushion, and this is very painful for people at the lower end of the income and wealth spectrum."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"So if your family is one where you spend most of your paycheck, every paycheck cycle, on gas, food, transportation, clothing, basics of life, and prices go up the way they’ve been going up, you’re in trouble right away."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, for starters, people are seeing their wage increases eaten up by inflation."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,So can you spell that out a little more for the general public on how that would work?
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mean, you seem to suggest inflation, high inflation, will eventually lead to a weaker job market."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"So can you explain, though, what about high inflation now threatens the job market?"
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"But in the short run, there is a lot of concern, as people have been expressing here, about higher unemployment as a result of these rate hikes or as a result of rate hikes."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"You’ve said several times that to have the labor market we want, we need price stability, and you suggested maybe there isn’t a tradeoff in the long run."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,I wanted to follow up with what you just mentioned about the labor market.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"Chris Rugaber, Associated Press."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I think we’re moving to do what we need to do and do our jobs, and that’s what you see us doing."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,Edward.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,EDWARD LAWRENCE.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,What is that economic pain?
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,Is it higher interest rates on credit cards?
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,Is it job losses?
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"As a follow-up, what is that economic pain in your mind?"
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,EDWARD LAWRENCE.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, to get there, we’re going to have to get supply and demand back in alignment, and that’s going to take tight monetary policy for a period of time."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,So we want to get back to that.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"So when inflation is low and stable, you can have these 9, 10, 11—10-year, anyway, expansions, and you can see what we saw in 2018, ’19, and ’20, which was very low unemployment, the biggest wage gains going to people at the low end of the spectrum, the smallest racial gaps that we’ve seen since we started keeping track of that."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,And that’s not an accident.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,We’ve had three of the four longest in measured history since we got inflation under control.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"Higher interest rates, slower growth, and a softening labor market are all painful for the public that we serve."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, at the same time, we’d be setting the economy up for another long period—this era has been noted for very long expansions."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"And also, if our projections are close to right, you’ll see that the costs in unemployment are, they’re meaningful, and they’re certainly very meaningful to the people who lose their jobs."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"And things will start to feel better to people—they’ll feel lower inflation, they’ll feel that the economy is improving."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I think once you’re on that path, that’s a good thing."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,And so what you see in our projections today is that inflation moves down significantly over the course of next year and then more the next year after that.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mean, it really depends on how long it takes for wages and, more than that, prices to come down for inflation to come down."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,How long?
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,How long from here should Americans be prepared for that economic pain?
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,So you had said that Americans and businesses need to feel some economic pain as we go forward.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,Edward Lawrence for Fox Business.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you for taking the question, Mr. Chairman."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,And we talk about that in our meetings quite a lot.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,Okay.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,Steve.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"In terms of reducing rates, I think we’d want to be very confident that inflation is moving back down to 2 percent before we would consider that."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,So that’s what we’ll be looking for.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"First, we’ll want to see growth continuing to run below trend, we’ll want to see movements in the labor market showing a return to a better balance between supply and demand, and, ultimately, we’ll want to see clear evidence that inflation is moving back down to 2 percent."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,So we’ll be looking at a few things.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, what will we be looking at, I guess, is your question."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"And in light of the high inflation we’re seeing, we think we’ll need to—and in light of what I just said, we think that we’ll need to bring our funds rate to a restrictive level and to keep it there for some time."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"Job openings are down a bit, as you know; quits are off their all-time highs; there’s some signs that some wage measures may be flattening out but not moving up; payroll gains have moderated but not much."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"On the second, though, so far there’s only modest evidence that the labor market is cooling off."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"So on the first, the Committee’s forecasts and those of most outside forecasters do show growth running below its longer-run potential this year and next year."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"To accomplish that, we think we’ll need to do two things, in particular: to achieve a period of growth below trend; and also some softening in labor market conditions to foster a better balance between demand and supply in the labor market."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"So the way we’re thinking about this is, the overarching focus of the Committee is getting inflation back down to 2 percent."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"The FOMC is strongly resolved to bring inflation down to 2 percent, and we will keep at it until the job is done."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I will answer—I will answer your question directly, but I want to start here today by saying that my main message has not changed at all since Jackson Hole."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,I wonder if you could give us a little detail around how you’ll know when to slow down these rate increases and how you’ll eventually know when to stop.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,Jeanna Smialek from the New York Times.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you for taking our questions.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Chair Powell."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,JEANNA SMIALEK.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you, and I look forward to your questions."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum-employment and price-stability goals.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,STEVE LIESMAN.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"Steve Liesman, CNBC."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,Can you talk about how you factor in the variable lags on inflation and the extent to which the outlook for rates should be seen as linear in the sense that you keep raising rates?
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"Do you keep raising rates, or is there a pause that you could envision where you kind of figure out what has happened to the economy and give time to catch up in the real economy—the rate increase time to catch up in the real economy?"
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,Is it linear?
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"Well, there you go."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,[Laughter] STEVE LIESMAN.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,I should know better than to answer your second question.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"Do you keep raising rates, or is there—oh, sorry, I should know better than to not talk with a microphone."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,Is it linear?
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,Is there a point in time you could see pausing?
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,STEVE LIESMAN.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,Everything we do is in service to our public mission.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,Your second question—sorry—was?
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"And that’s why I noted in my opening remarks that, at some point, as the stance of policy tightens further, it will become appropriate to slow the pace of rate hikes while we assess how our cumulative policy adjustments are affecting the economy and inflation."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,So we are very much mindful for that.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,But it’s likely to take some time to see the full effects of changing financial conditions on inflation.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"Then, changes in financial conditions begin to affect economic activity fairly quickly, within a few months."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"In fact, financial conditions have usually been affected well before we actually announce our decisions."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"The way I think of it is, our policy decisions affect financial conditions immediately."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, of course, monetary policy does, famously, work with long and variable lags."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,Sure.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"Well, can you envision a time when there’s a pause to kind of look at what has been wrought in the economy from the rate increases?"
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,So that’s how we think about that.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"To conclude: We understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,Restoring price stability is essential to set the stage for achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the longer run.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"FOMC participants expect supply and demand conditions in the labor market to come into better balance over time, easing the upward pressure on wages and prices."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,The labor force participation rate showed a welcome uptick in August but is little changed since the beginning of the year.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"The labor market continues to be out of balance, with demand for workers substantially exceeding the supply of available workers."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"Job gains have been robust, with employment rising by an average of 378,000 jobs per month over the last three months."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"Despite the slowdown in growth, the labor market has remained extremely tight, with the unemployment rate near a 50-year low, job vacancies near historical highs, and wage growth elevated."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"As shown in our Summary of Economic Projections, since June, FOMC participants have marked down their projections for economic activity, with the median projection for real GDP growth standing at just 0.2 percent this year and 1.2 percent next year, well below the median estimate of the longer-run normal growth rate."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"Higher interest rates and slower output growth also appear to be weighing on business fixed investment, while weaker economic growth abroad is restraining exports."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"Activity in the housing sector has weakened significantly, in large part reflecting higher mortgage rates."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"Growth in consumer spending has slowed from last year’s rapid pace, in part reflecting lower real disposable income and tighter financial conditions."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,Recent indicators point to modest growth of spending and production.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"The U.S. economy has slowed from the historically high growth rates of 2021, which reflected the reopening of the economy following the pandemic recession."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,I will have more to say about today’s monetary policy actions after briefly reviewing economic developments.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"In addition, we are continuing the process of significantly reducing the size of our balance sheet."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,We are moving our policy stance purposefully to a level that will be sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2 percent.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"Today the FOMC raised its policy interest rate by ¾ percentage point, and we anticipate that ongoing increases will be appropriate."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"In particular, without price stability, we will not achieve a sustained period of strong labor market conditions that benefit all."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"Without price stability, the economy does not work for anyone."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,Price stability is the responsibility of the Federal Reserve and serves as the bedrock of our economy.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,We have both the tools we need and the resolve that it will take to restore price stability on behalf of American families and businesses.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,My colleagues and I are strongly committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,Good afternoon.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"Transcript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference September 21, 2022 CHAIR POWELL."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"Just as a quick follow-up: I mean, if the concern is that underlying inflation is becoming more entrenched, perhaps, each month, then why forgo the more aggressive 100 basis point increase today, and does that risk having to do more later on?"
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"The median projection in the SEP for the unemployment rate rises to 4.4 percent at the end of next year, ½ percentage point higher than in the June projections."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"Over the next three years, the median unemployment rate runs above the median estimate of its longer-run normal level."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,Inflation remains well above our 2 percent longer-run goal.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"Over the 12 months ending in July, total PCE prices rose 6.3 percent; excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 4.6 percent."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"Reducing inflation is likely to require a sustained period of below-trend growth, and there will very likely be some softening of labor market conditions."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,Our overarching focus is using our tools to bring inflation back down to our 2 percent goal and to keep longer-term inflation expectations well anchored.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"Of course, these projections do not represent a Committee decision or plan, and no one knows with any certainty where the economy will be a year or more from now."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"The median projection rises to 4.6 percent at the end of next year and declines to 2.9 percent by the end of 2025, still above the median estimate of its longer-run value."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"As shown in the SEP, the median projection for the appropriate level of the federal funds rate is 4.4 percent at the end of this year, 1 percentage point higher than projected in June."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,The historical record cautions strongly against prematurely loosening policy.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,Restoring price stability will likely require maintaining a restrictive policy stance for some time.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,We will continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting and communicate our thinking as clearly as possible.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"At some point, as the stance of monetary policy tightens further, it will become appropriate to slow the pace of increases while we assess how our cumulative policy adjustments are affecting the economy and inflation."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"With today’s action, we have raised interest rates by 3 percentage points this year."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,We anticipate that ongoing increases in the target range for the federal funds rate will be appropriate; the pace of those increases will continue to depend on the incoming data and the evolving outlook for the economy.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,We will keep at it until we are confident the job is done.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"Over coming months, we will be looking for compelling evidence that inflation is moving down consistent with inflation returning to 2 percent."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"At today’s meeting, the Committee raised the target range for the federal funds rate by ¾ percentage point, bringing the target range to 3 to 3¼ percent."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"We are highly attentive to the risks that high inflation poses to both sides of our mandate, and we are strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent objective."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"My colleagues and I are acutely aware that high inflation imposes significant hardship, as it erodes purchasing power, especially for those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,The Fed’s monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"But that is not grounds for complacency; the longer the current bout of high inflation continues, the greater the chance that expectations of higher inflation will become entrenched."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"Despite elevated inflation, longer-term inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters as well as measures from financial markets."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,Participants continue to see risks to inflation as weighted to the upside.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"The median projection in the SEP for total PCE inflation is 5.4 percent this year and falls to 2.8 percent next year, 2.3 percent in 2024, and 2 percent in 2025."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"Although gasoline prices have turned down in recent months, they remain well above year-earlier levels, in part reflecting Russia’s war against Ukraine, which has boosted prices for energy and food and has created additional upward pressure on inflation."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,Price pressures remain evident across a broad range of goods and services.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"In August, the 12-month change in the consumer price index was 8.3 percent, and the change in the core CPI was 6.3 percent."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we are continuing the process of significantly reducing the size of our balance sheet, which plays an important role in firming the stance of monetary policy."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,So I think it’s very hard to say with precise certainty the way this is going to unfold.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,We are taking forceful and rapid steps to moderate demand so that it comes into better alignment with supply.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"And what you see in the SEP numbers is people’s views as of today, as of this meeting, as to the kind of levels that will be appropriate."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,What’s the incentive to continue front-loading right now?
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, just as a follow-up to that, I’m wondering about the sort of risk-management considerations here, given there’s some discussion now of overdoing it."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,HOWARD SCHNEIDER.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"I would say that we’re committed to getting to a restrictive level for the federal funds rate and getting there pretty quickly, and that’s what we’re thinking about."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,We didn’t make that decision today; we didn’t vote on that.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,So we’re going to make that decision at the meeting.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,So that would be 25 basis points less.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"You’re right that the median for the year-end suggests another 125 basis points in rate increases, but there’s also, there’s another fairly large group that saw a 100 basis points addition to where we are today."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we make one decision per meeting, and the decision we made today was to raise the federal funds rate by 75 [basis points]."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,Is 75 next month the baseline?
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"You say it’s meeting by meeting, but it sure looks like we’re going 75–50–25."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,I just want to be clear on the SEPs.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks for the opportunity.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,Howard Schneider with Reuters.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,Hi.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,HOWARD SCHNEIDER.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,Howard.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think you would see at that time—you’d see positive real rates across the yield curve, and that is also an important consideration."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I think that would be the case if you look at the numbers that we’re writing down and think about—you measure those against some sort of forward-looking assessment of inflation, inflation expectations."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,You want to be at a place where real rates are positive across the entire yield curve.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"And you see this, I think, in the Committee forecast."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"We also, I would think—and you see this in the—this is something we talked about today in the meeting and talk about in all of our meetings."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,Is it lack of progress on inflation seen in the CPI reports?
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"You look at broader financial conditions, as you know; you look at where rates are, real and nominal in some cases; you look at credit spreads; you look at financial conditions indexes."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,By now we would have thought that we’d have seen some of that.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,COLBY SMITH.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"As I mentioned, what we think we need to do and should do is to move our policy rate to a restrictive level that’s restrictive enough to bring inflation down to 2 percent, where we have confidence of that."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,But you’re right—it is a tenth higher than 2 percent.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"So it’s not—I mean, I would say that if, actually, if the economy followed this path, this would be a pretty good outcome."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mean, we write down our forecasts, and we figure out what the median is, and we publish it."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I guess core is at 2.1 in 2025—in the median—and headline is at 2.0, so that’s pretty close."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,And does that mean there’s a level of inflation above the 2 percent target that the Fed is willing to tolerate?
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"Chair Powell, how should we interpret the fact that core inflation is still not forecast in the SEP to be back to target in 2025, and yet the dot plot projects cuts as early as 2024?"
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,Colby Smith with the Financial Times.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,COLBY SMITH.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,Let’s go to Colby.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,So that’s how we’re thinking about it.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,But people are writing that down in their SEP where they think policy needs to be.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,And we’re still discovering what that level is.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, what that tells us is that we need to continue, and we can—keep doing these, and we did today—do another large increase as we approach the level that we think we need to get to."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,And that’s not where we expected or wanted to be.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,So that’s a pretty good summary of where we are with inflation.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"If you look at core PCE inflation, which is a good measure of where inflation is running now, if you look at it on a 3-, 6-, and 12-month trailing annualized basis, you’ll see that inflation is at 4.8 percent, 4.5 percent, and 4.8 percent."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"We have seen some supply- side healing, but inflation has not really come down."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,We haven’t.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, what we’ve seen is, inflation has—our expectation has been that we would begin to see inflation come down, largely because of supply-side healing."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, what do you look at?"
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,Or is it a motivation to get as much done while the job market is still as strong as it is?
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"We also know that there are long and variable lags, particularly as they relate to inflation."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I guess the third thing I would point to that’s different this time is that part of this inflation is caused by this series of supply shocks that we’ve had, beginning with the pandemic, and, really, with the reopening of the economy, and more recently amplified and added to by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine—have all contributed to the sharp increase in inflation."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"But to the extent that continues to be the case, that should make it easier to restore price stability."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"In addition, in this cycle, longer-run inflation expectations have generally been fairly well anchored, and, as I’ve said, there’s no basis for complacency there."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,So that’s one thing.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s plausible, I’ll say, that job openings could come down significantly—and they need to—without as much of an increase in unemployment as has happened in earlier historical episodes."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"First—and you know these—but first, job openings are incredibly high relative to the number of people looking for work."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, really, that is what we generally expect because we see the current situation as outside of historical experience in a number of ways, and I’ll mention a couple of those."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"Now, why is that?"
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"So you’re right—in the SEP, there’s what I would characterize as a relatively modest increase in the unemployment rate from a historical perspective, given the expected decline in inflation."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"Should we interpret that to mean no soft landing, and is that kind of rise necessary to get inflation down?"
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"So these are the kinds of events that are not really seen in prior business cycles, and, in principle, if those things start to get better—and we do see some evidence of the beginnings of that."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"The projections show the unemployment rate rising to 4.4 percent next year, and, historically, that kind of rise in the unemployment rate would typically bring a recession with it."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,Rachel Siegel from the Washington Post.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Chair Powell."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,RACHEL SIEGEL.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,Rachel.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,Okay.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"Clearly, today we’re, we’ve just moved, I think, probably, into the very lowest level of what might be restrictive, and, certainly, in my view and the view of the Committee, there’s a ways to go."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,But we’re not at that level.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,So it’s a challenging assessment.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"There is a possibility, certainly, that we would go to a certain level that we’re confident in and stay there for a time."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"Now, those will evolve over time, and I think we’ll just have to see how that goes."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you for taking our questions.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s not much more than that, but it’s good to see that."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,Right.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"Well, so, again, we believe that we need to raise our policy stance overall to a level that is restrictive—and by that I mean, is meaningfully, putting meaningful downward pressure on inflation."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"For example, commodity prices look like they may have peaked for now; supply chain disruptions are beginning to resolve."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"If inflation doesn’t perform as you expect, do you want to have a policy rate that’s above the underlying inflation rate, for example, and do you have an estimate for where you think the underlying inflation rate might be in the economy right now?"
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"And so I was wondering if you could discuss how you are thinking about, as the data come in, where that destination is, how it’s moving up."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"But I imagine you have to have some idea about how you’re thinking about your destination, whether it’s a stopping point or a pausing point."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"You said not too long ago, in describing the policy destination, there’s still a way to go."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,NICK TIMIRAOS.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,Nick.

2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"We think those things have, for quite a time now, really added value in terms of understanding where the labor market is."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"That and quits are really very good ways to look at how tight the labor market is and how different it is from other cycles, where, generally, the unemployment rate itself is the single best indicator."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s what we need to see in the stance of policy.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"Yes, vacancies are still almost a 2-to-1 ratio to unemployed people."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,Just to follow up on one small thing—are vacancies still at the top of your list in terms of understanding the labor market and how much room there is there?
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,RACHEL SIEGEL.
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"Nonetheless, we’re committed to getting inflation back down to 2 percent—because we think that a failure to restore price stability would mean far greater pain later on."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"In addition, the chances of a soft landing are likely to diminish to the extent that policy needs to be more restrictive or restrictive for longer."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"That’s going to depend on how quickly wage and price inflation pressures come down, whether expectations remain anchored, and whether, also, do we get more labor supply, which would help as well."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we don’t know—no one knows whether this process will lead to a recession or, if so, how significant that recession would be."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"We have always understood that restoring price stability while achieving a relatively modest decline—or, rather, increase—in unemployment and a soft landing would be very challenging."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"So let me just say, how much these factors will turn out to really matter in this sequence of events—it remains to be seen."
2022-09-21,Press Conf - Full Text,"Those developments, if sustained, could help ease the pressures on inflation."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.

2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,JONNELLE MARTE.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Chair Powell."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,Jonnelle Marte with Bloomberg.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,Could you talk about what this does to the public’s trust in the bank and what the Fed is doing to prevent this kind of behavior from becoming common?
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"So some senators, like Elizabeth Warren, are saying that this is a sign of greater ethics problems at the Fed."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"So you’re right—the public’s trust is really the Fed’s and any central bank’s most important asset, and any time one of us, one of the policymakers, violates or falls short of those rules, we do risk undermining that trust, and we take that very seriously."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,Sure.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think by the actions that we take, though, we help keep longer-term inflation expectations anchored and keep the public believing in 2 percent inflation by the things that we do, even in times when energy is part of the story of why inflation is high."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,So the Fed is facing two more ethics-related incidents with the revision of the financial statements from President Bostic and President Bullard speaking at a closed event.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,KAYLA TAUSCHE.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"The Fed has acknowledged in the past that the tools that you have don’t affect things like energy and food prices that stem from some of those conflicts overseas, and they’re some of the biggest pain points for consumers."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"You’re right, though."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"So our tools are well suited to work on that problem, and that’s what we’re doing."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’ve got an imbalance between demand and supply, which you see in many parts of the economy."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"In the United States, we also have a demand issue."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"The thing about the United States is that we also have strong—in many other jurisdictions, the principal problem really is energy."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we don’t directly affect, for the most part, food and energy prices, but the demand channel does affect them just at the margin."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"So as you pursue the current path that you’ve outlined, is there a risk that some of those prices simply don’t come down?"
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,If I could just follow up up on that—thank you.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"Price stability is the kind of thing that pays dividends for our economy—for decades, hopefully—even though it may be difficult to get it back."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,Getting it back is something that gives—that provides value to the people we serve for the long run.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,We do.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"We don’t—the price of oil is set globally, and it’s not something we can affect."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"So at the beginning of our meeting yesterday, actually, we had a Committee discussion of the full Committee on the importance of holding ourselves individually and collectively accountable for knowing and following the high standard that’s set out in our existing rules with respect to both personal investment activities and external communications."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"We think, just empirically, it dominates the ones that people tend to look at, which is 2s, 10s, and things like that."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"I would say that our new investment program that we have is up now and running, and, actually, it was through that that the problems with President Bostic’s disclosures were discovered, when he filed his new disclosure."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"In this case, if you’re in a situation where the markets are pricing in significant declines in inflation, that’s going to affect the forward curve."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,It can be doing that because it affects—it expects cuts or because it expects inflation to come down.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,Price stability in the United States is a good thing for the global economy over a long period of time.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, also, you have to look at why things—why the rate curve is doing what it’s doing."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,So it’s not inverted.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,And it’s—that’s been our preferred measure.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"Well, so we do monitor the near-term forward spread—you’re right."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"And you said, quote, “If it’s inverted, that means the Fed’s going to cut, which means the economy is weak.” That curve is only 2 basis points away from inversion now, so I’m wondering why you are so confident that you have not overtightened, particularly given that rates work with a lag."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"Earlier this year, you touted the three-month bill yield out to 18 months as the yield curve with 100 percent explanatory power."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,Michael McKee from Bloomberg Television and Radio.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHAEL MCKEE.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,Michael.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,So that’s what he’s doing.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,We don’t really have that.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s just—the inspector general has, he has the ability to do investigations."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, as you know, I referred the matter concerning President Bostic to the inspector general, and once that happens, I don’t discuss it with the inspector general or with anybody."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,I don’t.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,Do you have an update on the investigations that are pending?
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,JONNELLE MARTE.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we—I think we all said to each other today— yesterday, actually, yesterday morning, we recommitted to each other and to this institution to hold ourselves to the highest standards and avoid these problems."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,It worked here.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,So it’s a really good system.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"Any trade anyone has to make is covered, has to be approved, preapproved, and there’s a lag—it has to be preapproved 45 days before it happens, so there’s no ability to game markets."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,We now have a central group here at the Board of Governors that looks into disclosures and follows them and approves people’s disclosures and also all of their trades.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we’ve taken a number of steps, and I would just say we do understand how important those issues are."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s a task we need to do.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"With the ECI reading this week, again, a mixed picture."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,So we know that we need to use our tools to get inflation under control.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,So do you see wages as being a significant driver of inflation?
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,VICTORIA GUIDA.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"But we look at, I guess as I just showed you, we look at a very broad range of data on the labor market."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,I don’t see the case for real softening just yet.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,So it’s a mixed picture.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"Vacancies are below their all-time high but not by as much as we thought, because—and the data series is volatile, we never take any one reading, we always look at two or three."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,They are coming down.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"We want to see—we would love to see vacancies coming down, quits coming down."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"And maybe that’s there, but it’s not obvious to me, because wages aren’t coming down—they’re just moving sideways at an elevated level, both ECI and average hourly earnings."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,Do we see—we keep looking for signs that sort of the beginning of a gradual softening is happening.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,So that’s the picture.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,I think wages have an effect on inflation and inflation has an effect on wages.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,Job creation still exceeds sort of the level that would hold the market where it is.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"There’s some rays of light inside that if you look at private-sector workers—that did come down, that compensation did come down."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,It didn’t show a decline.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,Let’s just say it was high.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,The headline number was a disappointment.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s true, with average hourly earnings, you see—so I would call it a flattening out at a level that’s well above the level that would be consistent over time with 2 percent inflation, assuming a reasonable productivity."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"You mentioned wages, so I guess I would characterize that as sort of a mixed picture."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,Most analysts thought we would get some labor supply coming in.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"We had, I think, very small increase this year, which we had really thought, we thought we would get that back."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,We’re getting really nothing in labor supply now.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I’d start with unemployment, which is typically the single statistic you would look to, is at a 50-year low, 3½ percent."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,So we look at a very wide range of data on the unemployment—on the labor market.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, yes, we monitor it."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"Overall, though, the broader picture is of an overheated labor market where demand substantially exceeds supply."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"There’s always—going back and forth, the question is, is that really elevated right now?"
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,I don’t think so.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,I don’t think wages are the principal story of why prices are going up.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"Core PCE inflation—which is a really good indicator of what’s going on for us, the way we see it—is running at 5.1 percent on a 12-month basis and sort of similar to that on a 3-, 6-, and 9-month basis."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"Here in the United States, we have a strong economy, and we have an economy where inflation is running at 5 percent."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,We think about the spillovers and that sort of thing.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,But we haven’t—we take all of that into account in our models.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,The strong dollar is a challenge for some countries.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,So we’re seeing—we see those difficulties.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,And we’re seeing China’s having issues with the zero-COVID policy and much slower growth than we’re used to seeing.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’re seeing very high inflation in Europe, significantly because of high energy prices related to the war in Ukraine."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I guess what—it’s clearly a time, a difficult time in the global economy."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,So we’re in touch with all of that.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’re in very frequent contact with our foreign counterparts both through the IMF meetings and the regular meetings with central banks that we have, and I have one this weekend with many, many central bankers."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, of course, we, we keep close tabs on economic developments and also geopolitical developments that are relevant to the economy abroad."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,And I’m wondering how the Fed is weighing international developments in light of a very strong economy here in the U.S. that would seem to be bucking those trends.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,The new U.K. prime minister warned of a profound economic crisis there.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"Earlier last month, the United Nations warned that there could be a global recession if central banks didn’t change course."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,Kayla Tausche from CNBC.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you so much.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,KAYLA TAUSCHE.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"But we won’t know that—that’ll be, that’ll be discovered empirically."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,We think there’s room for that.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,It can soften through job openings declining.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we think we can—we do think that, given the data that we have, that this labor market can soften without having to soften as much as history would indicate through the unemployment channel."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,We want wages to go up—we just want them to go up at a level that’s sustainable and consistent with 2 percent inflation.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,So we don’t want to see it.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"I also don’t think that we see a wage–price spiral, but, again, it’s not something you can—once you see it, you’re in trouble."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,I don’t think that.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,The world’s not going to be better off if we fail to do that.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,You’re right.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,And our job is to restore price stability so that we can have a strong labor market that benefits all over time.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHAEL MCKEE.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Chair Powell."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,We’ll go to Nancy for the last question.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"And that’s just—we take all that as a given, but we know what our objective is, and we know what our tools can do, and that’s how we think about it."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,We’re going to have to stick with this.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we see those things, and what those things tell us is that our job is going to require some resolve and some patience over time."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"We still see pretty significant demand and a tightening labor market in some respects, although I think, overall, I would say it’s not really tightening or loosening."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,Demand is going to have some support from those savings and also from the strong demand that’s still in the labor market.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,How does that play into your thinking about the future?
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,Nancy Marshall-Genzer from Marketplace.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"There’s tens of billions yet to be spent, I mean, from the Inflation Reduction Act, the American Rescue Plan, CHIPS Act, bipartisan infrastructure bill."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,EDWARD LAWRENCE.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,So it must have to do with the savings that people have.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I don’t know how big the fiscal headwinds are, and they haven’t shown up in the way that we thought they would in restraining spending."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,The banks that deal with retail customers and many retailers will tell you that the consumers are still buying and they’re still—they’re fine.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s not shrinking.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"It appears, consumer spending is still positive—it’s at pretty modest growth levels."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"In theory, it was a headwind this year, but I do think the broader context is that you have households that have these significant amounts of savings and can keep spending even in—so I think those two things do tend to wage—to sort of counterbalance each other out."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,So how big of a headwind is all the fiscal spending to what the Federal Reserve’s trying to do to get inflation back to the 2 percent target?
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you, Fed Chairman."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,Edward Lawrence with Fox Business.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,EDWARD LAWRENCE.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, what about the spending?"
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"I’m wondering, has the window for a soft landing narrowed?"
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,Do you still think it’s possible?
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,So have wages.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks very much.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"That means that we have to have policy be more restrictive, and that narrows the path to a soft landing, I would say."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"At the same time, now you see services inflation, core services inflation moving up, and I just think that the inflation picture has become more and more challenging over the course of this year, without question."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"Actually, it has come down, but not to the extent that we had hoped."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,And it really hasn’t.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"What we would expect by now to have seen is that as the—really, as the supply-side problems have resolved themselves, we would have expected goods inflation to come down by now, long since by now."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,The implication of inflation not coming down.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,Because we haven’t seen inflation coming down.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,Just real quickly—why do you feel like the window has narrowed?
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,And that’s what we’re going to do.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think no one knows whether there’s going to be a recession or not and, if so, how bad that recession would be."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"Again, that’s going to be something we discover empirically."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"All I would say is that the job losses may turn out to be less than would be indicated by those traditional measures, because job openings are so elevated and because the labor market is so strong."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"Data’s a little bit different this time, though, because you have this tremendously high level of vacancies and, we think, on a very steep part of the Beveridge curve."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"So all those things are relationships that are in the data, and they’re very real."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"Again, I would say that the sort of array of data in the labor market is highly unusual and, to many economists, there is a path to— ordinarily there’s a relationship to GDP going down and vacancies declining, translating into unemployment, or there’s Okun’s law."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,Hard to say.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,Hard to say.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"I would say the path has narrowed over the course of the last year, really."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’ve always said it was going to be difficult, but I think to the extent rates have to go higher and stay higher for longer, it becomes harder to see the path—it’s narrowed."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,Yes.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,Is it still possible?
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,Yes.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,Has it narrowed?
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,Edward.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"So those—I control those messages, and that’s my job."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,And the last thing I’ll say is that I would want people to understand our commitment to getting this done and to not making the mistake of not doing enough or the mistake of withdrawing our strong policy and doing that too soon.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"Are you going to need to put a greater weight on that in order to ascertain things like whether there’s overtightening going on, or will you still focus as much on the more lagging government indicators?"
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"And as we go forward, private real-time data is clearly showing these hits to housing."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"Just to go back to housing for a minute: You mentioned the impact that rate increases have had on housing—home sales are down 25 percent in the past year, and so forth—but none of this is really showing up in, as you know, in the government’s inflation measures."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,Chris Rugaber at Associated Press.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,CHRISTOPHER RUGABER.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,Chris Rugaber.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,But the first thing is to find your way there.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,There’s been no decision or discussion around exactly what steps we would take at that point.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,It doesn’t—we’ll have to see.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I don’t know what we’ll do when we get there, by the way."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"What’s the place, what’s the level we need to get to rates?"
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I think as we’re farther along, we’re now focused on that."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"What has changed, though—you’re right—is, we’re farther along now."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,So that isn’t going to change.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s really how I look at it.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,And the record is that the employment costs—the cost to the people that we don’t want to hurt—they go up with the passage of time.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"By then, the risk, really, is that it has become entrenched in people’s thinking."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"On the other hand, if you make the mistake in the other direction and you let this drag on, then it’s a year or two down the road, and you’re realizing, inflation behaving the way it can, you’re realizing you didn’t actually get it, you have to go back in."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"Again, if we overtighten—and we don’t want to, we want to get this exactly right—but if we overtighten, then we have the ability with our tools, which are powerful, to, as we showed at the beginning of the pandemic episode, we can support economic activity strongly if that happens, if that’s necessary."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think until we get inflation down, you’ll be hearing that from me."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"I would not—I would not change a word in that statement, though."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"Well, what’s happened is, time has passed, and we’ve raised interest rates by 375 basis points."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,Is what you’re trying to tell us today is that that risk assessment has changed a little bit?
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,If I could follow up: You also said several meetings ago that the risk of doing too little outweighed the risk of doing too much.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,And that’s what I would say.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,So this is an interesting subject.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"And that makes sense, actually, because for that reason—conceptually, that is—that’s sort of the right target for monetary policy."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,We have a ways to go.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s really not a conversation to be had now.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,And it’s not something that we’re thinking about.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I would also say, it’s premature to discuss pausing."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,We’re exactly where we were a year ago.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"If you look at the—I have a table of the last 12 months of 12-month readings, and there’s really no pattern there."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mean, I would have little confidence that the forecast—if we made a forecast today, if we were doing an SEP today, the pattern has been that, one after another, they go up, and that’ll end when it ends, but there’s no sense that inflation is coming down."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"I’ve also said that we think that the level of rates that we estimated in September—the incoming data suggests that that’s actually going to be higher, and that’s been the pattern."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"And that’s meant to put that question, really, as the important one now, going forward."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,And putting that in the statement and identifying that as a goal is an important step.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"Our message should be—what I’m trying to do is make sure that our message is clear, which is that we think we have a ways to go, we have some ground to cover with interest rates before we get to, before we get to that level of interest rates that we think is sufficiently restrictive."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,We’re not targeting any one or two particular things.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,Is that a problem or what—how that might affect your future policy to see this positive reaction?
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,Is that something you wanted to see?
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,It looks like stock and bond markets are reacting positively to your announcement so far.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"Great, and just a quick follow."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,CHRISTOPHER RUGABER.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"But I would say that in terms of—the right way to think about inflation, really, is to look at the measure that we do look at, but considering that we also know that at some point, you’ll see rents coming down."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we’re well aware of that, of course, and we look at it."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,But that point is well out from where we are now.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"But at some point, once you get through that, the new leases are going to tell you—what they’re telling you is, there will come a point at which rent inflation will start to come down."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"But what you’re—the implication is that there are still, as people, as non-new leases roll over and expire, right, they’re still in the pipeline, there’s still some significant rate increases coming, okay?"
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,And now they’re coming down faster.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"One thing is, I think right now, if you look at the pattern of that series of the new leases, it’s very pro-cyclical, so rents went up much more than the CPI and PCE rents did."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"The private measures are, of course, good at picking up, at the margin, the new leases, and they tell you a couple things."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"And the same thing is true for owners’ equivalent rent, which comes off of—it’s a reweighting of tenant rents."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I start by saying, I guess, that the measure that’s in the CPI and the PCE, it captures rents for all tenants, not just new leases."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,But so has quits.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,I think that’s always been the case.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we talk a lot about vacancies in the—vacancy-to-unemployed rate, but it’s just one, it’s just another data series."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"We think there’s some ground to cover before we meet that test, and that’s why we say that ongoing rate increases will be appropriate."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,And I’ll talk more about that.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we’re saying that we’d raise that rate to a level that’s sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation to our 2 percent target over time, and we put that into our postmeeting statement because that really does become the important question, we think now, is how far to go."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"So now we come to the second question, which is how high to raise our policy rate."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s a historically fast pace, and that’s certainly appropriate given the persistence and strength in inflation and the low level from which we started."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’ve moved 3¾ percent since March, admittedly from a base of zero."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"So on the first question—how fast to tighten policy—it’s been very important that we move expeditiously, and we have clearly done so."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"And the third will be, eventually, how long to remain at a restrictive level."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,The second is how high to raise our policy rate.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I think you can think about our tightening program as really addressing three questions, the first of which was, and has been, how fast to go."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, what I want to do is put that question of pace in the context of our broader tightening program, if I may, and talk about the statement language along the way."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, as I mentioned, incoming data between the meetings, both a strong labor market report but particularly the CPI report, do suggest to me that we may ultimately move to higher levels than we thought at the time of the September meeting."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,Would you say that the bias right now is not for another 75 basis point increase?
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Howard Schneider with Reuters."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,HOWARD SCHNEIDER.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,Howard.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"We will be looking at real rates, for example, all across the yield curve and all other financial conditions as we make that assessment."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"Well, we’ll take into account the full range of analysis and data that bear on that question, guided by our assessment of how much financial conditions have tightened, the effects that that tightening is actually having on the real economy and on inflation, taking into consideration lags, as I mentioned."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,How will we know that we’ve reached that level?
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,We need to bring our policy stance down to a level that’s sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation down to our 2 percent objective over the medium term.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"Of course, that’s what we’d all love to see, but that’s—I’ve never thought of that as the appropriate test for slowing the pace of increases or for identifying the appropriately restrictive level that we’re aiming for."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"We do need to see inflation coming down decisively, and good evidence of that would be a series of down monthly readings."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,So a couple things on that.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,I’m sure there’s going to be tons of confusion out there about whether this means you’re going to slow in December or not.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"That level is very uncertain, though, and I would say we’re going to find it over time."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"Of course, with the lags between policy and economic activity, there’s a lot of uncertainty, so we note that in determining the pace of future increases, we’ll take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy as well as the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I would say, as we come closer to that level, move more into restrictive territory, the question of speed becomes less important than the second and third questions."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"But I would think you’d look more at a forward, a forward-looking measure of inflation to look at that."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s the classic “Taylor principle” view.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I would say, there are a range of views on it."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"So this is the question of, does the policy rate need to get above the inflation rate?"
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,Is there any reason to think you won’t have to raise rates at least above that level to be confident that you are imparting enough restraint to bring inflation down?
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"Chair Powell, core PCE inflation on a 3- or 6-month annualized basis and on a 12-month basis has been running in the high 4s, close to 5 percent."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,NICK TIMIRAOS.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,Nick.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"Remember, though, that we still think there’s a need for ongoing rate increases, and we have some ground left to cover here, and cover it we will."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,I think it’s been good and a successful program that we’ve gotten this far this fast.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,But there’s no—I don’t have any sense that we’ve overtightened or moved too fast.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we did discuss this, and, as I mentioned, we’ll discuss it again in December."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I think that at this meeting, as in the last two meetings, as I’ve mentioned, I’ve said that we—that there would come a point, and this was a meeting at which we had a discussion about what that might mean."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think there’s—very difficult to make a case that our current level is too tight, given that inflation still runs well above the federal funds rate."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,I don’t think we’ve overtightened.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"Well, I think I’m pleased that we have moved as fast as we have."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"If I could follow up on that, to what degree was there an importance or weight given to a need to signal this possibility now, given all the concerns, really around the globe, about Fed policy sort of driving ahead and everybody else dealing with their own stress as a result?"
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,HOWARD SCHNEIDER.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"To be clear, let me say again [that] the question of when to moderate the pace of increases is now much less important than the question of how high to raise rates and how long to keep monetary policy restricted, which really will be our principal focus."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"It is likely we’ll have a discussion about this at the next meeting, a discussion."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,No decision has been made.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"So that time is coming, and it may come as soon as the next meeting or the one after that."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"And that’s why I’ve said at the last two press conferences that at some point, it will become appropriate to slow the pace of increases."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"Or is that something that the Fed could potentially proceed with, independent of that data, given the lagged effects that you mentioned?"
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"On the need to slow the pace of rate increases at some point: Is a downshift contingent on a string of better inflation data specifically between now and, let’s say, the December meeting?"
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,Colby Smith with the Financial Times.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,And the recent inflation data again have come in higher than expected.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"Over the 12 months ending in September, total PCE prices rose 6.2 percent; excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 5.1 percent."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,Inflation remains well above our longer-run goal of 2 percent.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,The labor force participation rate is little changed since the beginning of the year.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"Although job vacancies have moved below their highs and the pace of job gains has slowed from earlier in the year, the labor market continues to be out of balance, with demand substantially exceeding the supply of available workers."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"Job gains have been robust, with employment rising by an average of 289,000 jobs per month over August and September."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"Despite the slowdown in growth, the labor market remains extremely tight, with the unemployment rate at a 50-year low, job vacancies still very high, and wage growth elevated."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,Higher interest rates and slower output growth also appear to be weighing on business fixed investment.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"Activity in the housing sector has weakened significantly, largely reflecting higher mortgage rates."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"Growth in consumer spending has slowed from last year’s rapid pace, in part reflecting lower real disposable income and tighter financial conditions."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,Recent indicators point to modest growth of spending and production this quarter.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,Real GDP rose at a pace of 2.6 percent last quarter but is unchanged so far this year.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,The U.S. economy has slowed significantly from last year’s rapid pace.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,I will have more to say about today’s monetary policy actions after briefly reviewing economic developments.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,Restoring price stability will likely require maintaining a restrictive stance of policy for some time.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"In addition, we are continuing the process of significantly reducing the size of our balance sheet."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,We are moving our policy stance purposefully to a level that will be sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2 percent.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,And we continue to anticipate that ongoing increases will be appropriate.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"Today, the FOMC raised our policy interest rate by 75 basis points."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"In particular, without price stability, we will not achieve a sustained period of strong labor market conditions that benefit all."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"Without price stability, the economy does not work for anyone."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,Price stability is the responsibility of the Federal Reserve and serves as the bedrock of our economy.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,We have both the tools that we need and the resolve it will take to restore price stability on behalf of American families and businesses.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,My colleagues and I are strongly committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,Good afternoon.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"Transcript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference November 2, 2022 CHAIR POWELL."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s been unusually important in this cycle because it’s been so out of line.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,Price pressures remain evident across a broad range of goods and services.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"But I think the answer is, we’ll want to get the policy rate to a level where it is, where the real interest rate is positive."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,Russia’s war against Ukraine has boosted prices for energy and food and has created additional upward pressure on inflation.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"But that is not grounds for complacency; the longer the current bout of high inflation continues, the greater the chance that expectations of higher inflation will become entrenched."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,COLBY SMITH.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,Colby.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you, and I look forward to your questions."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,Everything we do is in service to our public mission.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"To conclude: We understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,We will stay the course until the job is done.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,The historical record cautions strongly against prematurely loosening policy.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,Restoring price stability is essential to set the stage for achieving maximum employment and stable prices in the longer run.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,Reducing inflation is likely to require a sustained period of below-trend growth and some softening of labor market conditions.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,Our overarching focus is using our tools to bring inflation back down to our 2 percent goal and to keep longer-term inflation expectations well anchored.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,We are taking forceful steps to moderate demand so that it comes into better alignment with supply.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,We will continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting and communicate our thinking as clearly as possible.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,Our decisions will depend on the totality of incoming data and their implications for the outlook for economic activity and inflation.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"Even so, we still have some ways to go, and incoming data since our last meeting suggest that the ultimate level of interest rates will be higher than previously expected."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,There is significant uncertainty around that level of interest rates.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,At some point—as I’ve said in the last two press conferences—it will become appropriate to slow the pace of increases as we approach the level of interest rates that will be sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation down to our 2 percent goal.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"That’s why we say in our statement that in determining the pace of future increases in the target range, we will take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy and the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"It will take time, however, for the full effects of monetary restraint to be realized, especially on inflation."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"Financial conditions have tightened significantly in response to our policy actions, and we are seeing the effects on demand in the most interest-rate-sensitive sectors of the economy, such as housing."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,We anticipate that ongoing increases in the target range for the federal funds rate will be appropriate in order to attain a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2 percent over time.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"With today’s action, we have raised interest rates by 3¾ percentage points this year."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we are continuing the process of significantly reducing the size of our balance sheet, which plays an important role in firming the stance of monetary policy."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"At today’s meeting, the Committee raised the target range for the federal funds rate by 75 basis points."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"We are highly attentive to the risks that high inflation poses to both sides of our mandate, and we are strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent objective."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"My colleagues and I are acutely aware that high inflation imposes significant hardship as it erodes purchasing power, especially for those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,The Fed’s monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"Despite elevated inflation, longer-term inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters, as well as measures from financial markets."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,We will want to do that.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum-employment and price-stability goals.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,I think you put some weight on that; you also put some weight on rates across the curve.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we go into this with a strong labor market and excess demand in the labor market, as you can see through many different things, and also with households who have strong spending power built up."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"And households, of course, have strong balance sheets."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,Very strong.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"I would say a big channel is the labor market, and the labor market is very, very strong."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,I don’t know that the channels through which policy works have changed that much.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"And on housing in particular, are you at all worried that you’re cramping housing supply in ways that might cause problems down the road?"
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,Is it narrower than it used to be?
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,Is the pathway and channels through which monetary policy works changing?
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s been relatively narrow in terms of the labor market, consumer demand; a lot of sectors, you don’t see a ton of effect."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"As you look around the economy, the clearest impact of your tightening so far has been on housing, maybe some venture-funded tech companies."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"Neil Irwin, Axios."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"So it may take time, it may take resolve, it may take patience."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thanks, Chair Powell."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,But I would expect us to continue to update it based on what we’re seeing with incoming data.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"We have a sense, and we’ll write down in September—sorry, in the December meeting, a new Summary of Economic Projections, which updates that."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we don’t—of course, we don’t really know exactly where that is."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,Our policy—we need ongoing rate hikes to get to that level of sufficiently restrictive.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,We have a ways to go.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s very premature, in my view, to think about or be talking about pausing our rate hike."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"So people, when they hear lags, they think about a pause."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,Let me say this: It is very premature to be thinking about pausing.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"But we will be thinking about them, but we won’t be—I think we’ll be considering them but because it’s appropriate to do so."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"Of course, we think about lags—the lags are just sort of a basic part of monetary policy."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think as we move now into restrictive territory, as we make these ongoing rate hikes and policy becomes more restrictive, it’ll be appropriate now to be thinking more about lags."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,NEIL IRWIN.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s likely to, to get inflation down."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"It may—I think you see, from our forecasts and others, that it will take some time for inflation to come down."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’ll take time, we think."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"I do not think of it as the single and only touchstone, though."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,How are you thinking about the labor market as it relates to inflation?
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,What do you see—are wages what’s really important?
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, for example, if wage growth is slowing and if maybe the unemployment rate starts to tick up, will that make you sort of decrease your focus on job openings?"
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"You mentioned early on, again, that job openings are very high compared to available workers, and I’m just curious to what extent you do and don’t draw signal from that."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,I wanted to ask about the labor market.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Victoria Guida with Politico."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,VICTORIA GUIDA.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,Victoria.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, no, we do understand that that’s really where a very big effect of our policy is."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,So it’s a very different situation and doesn’t present potential financial—doesn’t appear to present financial stability issues.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,Housing credit was very carefully—much more carefully managed by the lenders.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"From a financial stability standpoint, we didn’t see in this cycle the kinds of poor credit underwriting that we saw before the Global Financial Crisis."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,We’re well aware of what’s going on there.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,So the housing market needs to get back into a balance between supply and demand.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"Many, many bidders and no conditions, that kind of thing."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"We all know the stories of how overheated the housing market was, prices going up."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, I would say housing was—the housing market was very overheated for the couple of years after the pandemic as demand increased and rates were low."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"And you’re seeing housing activity decline, and you’re seeing housing prices growing at a faster rate and, in some parts of the country, declining."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"Yes, so we look at housing—of course, housing is significantly affected by these higher rates, which are really back where they were before the Global Financial Crisis—they’re not historically high, but they’re much higher than they’ve been."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"Oh, housing—the housing part of it."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,Housing.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,NEIL IRWIN.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, sorry, was I getting to your question there?"
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,And if I could follow up: Should we interpret the addition to the statement to mean that more weight is put into those lag effects than they would have been after previous rate hikes?
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,Neil Irwin.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"So from a risk- management standpoint, we want to be sure that we don’t make the mistake of either failing to tighten enough or loosening policy too soon."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"And they were moving up a little bit at the middle part of this year, and they’ve moved now back down."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"So if we saw longer-term expectations moving up, that would be very troubling."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,So I guess I would start by pointing to expectations.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,Is inflation becoming entrenched?
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"I wondered, do you see any evidence at this stage that inflation is, or is at risk of becoming, entrenched?"
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,Jeanna Smialek with the New York Times.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you for taking our questions.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Chair Powell."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,JEANNA SMIALEK.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,Jeanna.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,RACHEL SIEGEL.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,NICK TIMIRAOS.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"There are many different—as you know, many different people publish an assessment of underlying inflation."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,But I wouldn’t want to land on any one assessment.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,So I think that’s what the principal models would tend to say.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, I mean, one way to look at it is that it’s a pretty stationary object and that when inflation runs—above that level, for sure—substantially above for some time, you’ll see it move up, but the movement will be fairly gradual."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"There are many, many models that look at that."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,I don’t have a specific number for you there.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"If I could follow up: What is your best assessment, or the staff’s best assessment right now, of the current rate of underlying inflation?"
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,NICK TIMIRAOS.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"I’d put some weight on it, but I wouldn’t say it’s something that is the single, dominant thing to look at."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,So I would look at that as an important feature.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"So households and businesses, if they’re [borrowing]—[there are] very meaningfully positive interest rates all across the curve for them, credit spreads are larger, so borrowing rates are significantly higher, and I think financial conditions have tightened quite a bit."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"Very few people borrow at the short end—at the federal funds rate, for example."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s one piece of data.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"Shorter-term inflation expectations moved up between the last meeting and this meeting, and we don’t think those are as indicative, but they may be important in the wage-setting process."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,So that’s very concerning.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,But you want to consider them but not take them literally.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,There’s a school of thought that believes that.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"And so from a risk-management standpoint—but we do need, it would be irresponsible not to, to ignore them."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,I guess the thing that I would say is: It’s highly uncertain—highly uncertain.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,We don’t know that.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"And there are plenty of economists that also think that once financial conditions change, that the effects on the economy are actually faster than they would have been before."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"That’s the way it has moved for a quarter of a century—in the direction of financial conditions, then monetary policy—because the markets are thinking, what is the central bank going to do?"
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I think it’s a very difficult place to be, but I would tend to be—want to be in the middle looking carefully at what’s actually happening with the economy and trying to make good decisions from a risk-management standpoint, remembering, of course, that if we were to overtighten, we could then use our tools strongly to support the economy, whereas if we don’t get inflation under control because we don’t tighten enough, now we’re in a situation where inflation will become entrenched and the costs, the employment costs in particular, will be much higher potentially."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"One big difference now is that it used to be that you would raise the federal funds rate, financial conditions would react, and then that would affect economic activity and inflation."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"The truth is, we don’t have a lot of data [consisting] of inflation of [rates] this high in what is, now, the modern economy."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,There’s newer literature that says that they’re shorter.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,There was an old literature that made those lags out to be fairly long.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,So that’s been the thinking for a long time.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,Now financial conditions react well before in expectation of monetary policy [actions].
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"I guess the other thing I would say is that the longer we have—we’re now 18 months into this episode of high inflation, and we don’t have a clearly identified, scientific way of understanding at what point inflation becomes entrenched."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"So the way I would think about that is, it’s commonly, for a long time, thought that monetary policy works with “long and variable lags,” and that it works first on financial conditions and then on economic activity and then perhaps later than that even on inflation."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,And so the thing we need to do from a risk-management standpoint is to use our tools forcefully but thoughtfully and get inflation under control—get it down to 2 percent—get it behind us.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s what we really need to do and what we’re strongly committed to doing.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,Rachel.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,RACHEL SIEGEL.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you for taking our questions.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,Rachel Siegel from the Washington Post.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,The statement points to lag times.
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"I’m wondering if you can walk us through how you judge those lag effects, what that timeline looks like over the coming months or even a year, and where you would expect it to show up in different parts of the economy."
2022-11-02,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Chair Powell."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,We laid out today what our best estimates are to get there.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,So if I—I think I got your question.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, you know, one thing is to say is, I think our policy’s in—getting into a pretty good place now."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’re restrictive, and I think we’re—you know, we’re getting close to that level of sufficient—we think—sufficiently restrictive."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"But the big story will really be the rest of it, and there’s not much progress there."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s the point I would make.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, of course, we’re—we welcome these better inflation reports for the last two months."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,They’re very welcome.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,But I think we’re realistic about the broader project.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,So that’s all.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s—you know, we see goods prices coming down."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,We understand what will happen with housing services.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, I mean, it boils down to, how long do we think this process is going to take?"
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"There’s a little bit of a disconnect between the optimistic view you just expressed about the economy and the changes that you’ve made in the SEP. And I’m wondering if you’re reacting to the fact that the markets have loosened financial conditions or if you feel the Fed may be a little bit behind on inflation, whether the recent disinflation we’re seeing is transitory or not, and how this affects the idea of a soft landing if you’re projecting just ½ percent growth for this year."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,You do see some beginning signs there.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHAEL MCKEE.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,Michael McKee.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"But we will be looking for wages moving, you know, down to more normal levels where workers are doing well and, ultimately, their gains are not being eaten up by inflation."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,These things can be volatile month to month.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,So we don’t put too much weight on any one report.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"Now, there may be composition effects and other effects in that."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"If you look at wages, look at the average hourly earnings number we got with the last payrolls report, you don’t really see much progress in terms of average hourly earnings coming down."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,And it’s very fundamentally about the labor market and wages.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, ultimately, that’s the big—the more than half, as I mentioned, of PCE core index."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,And we have a ways to go there.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,So that should help.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,And that’s going to take some time.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"And the big piece, again, is core services, ex housing, which is very important."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"There’s a—excuse me, Michael McKee from Bloomberg Radio and Television."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,I think my view and my colleagues’ view is that this will take some time.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,And I wish there were a completely painless way to restore price stability.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"Of course, they’re very welcome."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,There isn’t.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"As long as housing—new housing leases show declining inflation, that will show up in the measure around the middle of next year."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,There will be some softening in labor market conditions.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,And so people are paying higher rates on mortgages and that kind of thing.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"What we’re doing now is, you know, it’s raising interest rates for people."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,So that’s really—the worst pain would be if we failed to act.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"So the largest amount of pain—the worst pain would come from a failure to raise rates high enough and from us allowing inflation to become entrenched in the economy so that the ultimate cost of getting it out of the economy would be very high in terms of employment, meaning very high unemployment for extended periods of time, the kind of thing that had to happen when inflation really got out of control and the Fed didn’t respond aggressively enough or soon enough in a prior episode, you know, 50 years ago."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,How would you describe that to Americans if the projections on unemployment find themselves—that’d be 1.6 million Americans out of jobs?
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"But with the Fed now expected to raise rates higher than you thought when you first said that, just wondering where we are in that pain."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,You warned Americans of pain earlier this year as the Fed hikes rates.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"Brian Cheung, NBC News."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Chairman Powell."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,BRIAN CHEUNG.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,Brian.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"And certainly, you know, lower inflation reports, were they to continue for a period of time, would increase the likelihood of a— put it this way, of a return to price stability that involves significantly less of an increase in unemployment than would be expected given the historical record."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"But we need to be honest with ourselves that there’s, you know, inflation—12-month core inflation is 6 percent CPI."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s three times our 2 percent target.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"Now, it’s good to see progress."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,But let’s just understand we have a long ways to go to get back to price stability.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHAEL MCKEE.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"Well, do you think the soft landing is no longer achievable?"
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’ll have to hold policy at a restrictive level for a sustained period so that, you know, two good—you know, two good monthly reports are, you know, very welcome."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,No.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,I don’t say that.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mean, I would say this: You know, to the extent we need to keep rates higher and keep them there for longer and inflation, you know, moves up higher and higher, I think that narrows the runway."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"But lower inflation readings, if they persist, in time, could certainly make it more possible."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I just—I don’t think anyone knows whether we’re going to have a recession or not and, if we do, whether it’s going to be a deep one or not."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s just, it’s not knowable."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"No, I wouldn’t say that."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"Housing services—as I mentioned, there’s good news in the pipeline."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,Some of your colleagues have been pretty explicit that they can’t imagine rate cuts happening in 2023.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"In terms of the pieces, we have been expecting goods inflation to come down as supply chain pressures eased."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,So you’re right.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"I’m wondering if you see that as disinflationary because you’re seeing supply chains improve or inflationary because it obviously brings a lot more demand globally, improves the global outlook for growth and for commodities prices."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"In the last few weeks, China has abandoned its COVID policy and been reopening pretty strongly."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,Let me ask you about China.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,Steve Matthews with Bloomberg.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,STEVE MATTHEWS.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,Steve.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,There are not rate cuts in the SEP for 2023.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,And you’re correct.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,So that’s the test I would articulate.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,I guess I would say it this way: I wouldn’t see us considering rate cuts until the Committee is confident that inflation is moving down to 2 percent in a sustained way.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,Historical experience cautions strongly against prematurely loosening policy.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,Those two things will offset each other.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,And we think that we’ll have to maintain a restrictive stance of policy for some time.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,What circumstances might make that plausible?
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,What’s your view of the likelihood of any kind of rate cuts next year?
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,But futures markets have priced in some easing in the back half of next year.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s certainly not implied by the SEP.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,Neil Irwin with Axios.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Chair Powell."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,NEIL IRWIN.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,Neil.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"Right now that—if you put into—if you factor in productivity estimates, standard productivity estimates, wages are running, you know, well above what would be consistent with 2 percent inflation."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,We just want them to be at a level that’s consistent with 2 percent inflation.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,And this is the best we can do.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s not on rate cuts.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"Weaker output in China will push down on commodity prices, but it could interfere with supply chains ultimately."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,And that could push inflation up in the West.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s very hard to say, you know, how much—how those two will offset each other."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, really, this gives us greater confidence in our forecasts rather than, at this point, changing our forecast."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,And this is the kind of reading that it will take to support that.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"As I mentioned, we’ve been expecting significant—forecasting significant declines in overall inflation and core inflation in the coming year."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"And what it does is, it provides greater confidence in our forecast of declining inflation."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,So the way we think about this is this: This report is very much in line with what we’ve been expecting and hoping for.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"As I mentioned in my opening statement, it will take substantially more evidence to give confidence that inflation is on a sustained downward path."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"So the data that we’ve received so far for October and November, we don’t have the—some of the—we have some remaining data to get in November, but they clearly do show a welcome reduction in the monthly pace of price increases."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,Right.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"Are you still worried it could slip into some kind of unentrenched, you know, upward spiral?"
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,Are you starting to see—are you confident that you’re seeing real progress on getting inflation under control?
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mean, it showed inflation cooling in all three of the categories that you laid out at Brookings."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,I wondered if you could comment a bit more about yesterday’s inflation report.

2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"And it doesn’t seem likely, actually, that the overall net effect would be material on us."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, to your point, China faces a very challenging situation in reopening."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, we’ve seen, waves of COVID all around the world can interfere with economic activity."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"China, a very critical manufacturing—place for manufacturing and exporting."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,Their supply chain is very important.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,And China faces a reopening.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s happening now.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"They’ve— you know, they’ve backed away from their COVID restriction policies."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,And we’ll just have to see.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s a risky situation.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"It—but, again, it doesn’t seem like it’s likely to have material overall effects on us."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,Chris.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,CHRIS RUGABER.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,There could be very significant increases in COVID.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"I do think, though, that—and markets are pretty confident, it seems to me—that we will get inflation under control."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, no, we don’t—we haven’t asked ourselves that question."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,We’re certainly highly committed to do that.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you, Chair Powell."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,JENNIFER SCHONBERGER.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,Jennifer.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we need to, you know, do that job."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I tried to identify that in my—in a speech I gave a month ago, but I stopped short of telling Congress what to do because, you know, they gave us a job."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,We need more people.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, you know, I think if you ask businesses, you know, pretty much everybody you talk to says there aren’t enough people."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"We don’t prescribe—you know, it’s not our job to prescribe things."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,And part of it is that migration has been lower.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,Part of it is that we lost a half a million people who would have been work—close to half a million who would have been working died from COVID.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,People dropped out and aren’t coming back at a higher rate than expected.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,Part of it is just accelerated retirements.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,So why is that?
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,And that—there’re lots of easy ways to get to bigger numbers than that if you go back a few more years.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,Just assume population and reasonable growth and aging of the population; our labor force should be 3½ million more than it is.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,Greg.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,GREG ROBB.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you, Chairman Powell."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,Greg Robb from MarketWatch.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,You spoke a little bit ago.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,You said that the U.S. looks—it looks like we have a structural labor shortage in the economy.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,Jennifer Schonberger with Yahoo Finance.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"Could you expand on that, talk a little bit more about that?"
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, what I meant by that, with “structural labor shortage,” is, if you look at where we are now, as I mentioned, there—if you just look at demand for labor, you can look at vacancies plus people who are actually working."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"And then you can take supply of labor by, “Are you in the labor market?” “Are you looking for a job or have a job?” And you’re 4— more than 4 million people short."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"We don’t see—despite very high wages and an incredibly tight labor market, we don’t see participation moving up—which is contrary to what we thought."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"So the upshot of all that is, the labor market is actually—it should—it’s 3½ million people, at least, smaller than it should have been based on pre-pandemic."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, really, are you talking about getting Congress action on increasing, like, legal immigration, things like that?"
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,You say you expect growth of just ½ percent next year.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you very much.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"It would—really, it’ll be a test of—for cutting rates, I think, in the event, it’ll be a question of, do we actually feel confident that inflation is coming down in a sustained way?"
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,I don’t see us as having a really clear and precise understanding of what the neutral rate is and what real rates are so that it would mechanically happen like that.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,That would be my test.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, as I mentioned, you know, we wouldn’t—I wouldn’t see the Committee cutting rates until we’re confident that inflation is moving down in a sustained way."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"Of course, that’s something that we know we’d see."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,So we do know that.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,Is that something you would want to see?
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,Is that something that’s built into the projections and into models?
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"If you’re reaching peak rates around 5 percent in the first half of next year and inflation starts to decline materially, that would seem to make the real rate gradually more restrictive."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,I wanted to ask about the SEP again.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,Jean Yung with Market News.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,Hi.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,JEAN YUNG.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,We’ll go to Jean for the last question.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,No.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mean, what we do is, we make our forecasts, and we publish them quarterly."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, if you look at those forecasts, those are forecasts for slow growth, for a softening labor market, by which I mean, unemployment goes up but not a great deal."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,And you see inflation coming down.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,You see rates going up a lot.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,You see inflation coming down.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"Given that you’ve said the process of raising rates and getting inflation back under control will be painful, have you had discussions within the Committee and addressed how long and/or how deep of a recession you would be willing to accept?"
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"Those are those forecasts, and that’s really what they show."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"We just, you know, we make those forecasts."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"The staff runs—and you will see this if you look at the old Tealbooks—runs alternative simulations of all different kinds at every meeting, and we look at those, too."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,And those will explore different things.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"But that’s just, you know, upside and downside scenarios."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"Of course, that’s a responsible practice that we’ve carried on for many decades."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,We want strong wage increases.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’re not—of course, we don’t talk about, you know, this kind of a recession and that kind of a recession."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,And I believe we will.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"But right now, clearly, the focus has to be on getting inflation down."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"So that means we need to really focus on getting inflation under control, and that’s what we’ll do."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"So that seems like something that would be really good for the economy and for the country, if we could get back to that."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"That’s—and all of that because of a tight labor market, a tight labor market which had inflation running, you know, just a tick below 2 percent and the economy growing right at its potential."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,The gaps between racial groups and gender groups were at their smallest in recorded history.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, what that looked like was, wage increases for the people at the lowest end of the income spectrum were the largest."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"So the—I would go back to the labor market that we had in 2018, ’19, ’20."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"Like, how do you factor potential exacerbations of inequality into your risk calculations, especially given the K-shaped recovery of 2020?"
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"As you monitor wage growth and unemployment data, I wonder if you’re paying close attention to a sector or even income level?"
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"Nicole Goodkind, CNN Business."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you, Chairman Powell."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,NICOLE GOODKIND.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,Nicole.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,We’re going to use our tools to get inflation back to 2 percent.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,We’re going to keep our inflation target at 2 percent.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,We’re not going to consider that under any circumstances.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,The Committee—we’re not considering that.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,Grady.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,GRADY TRIMBLE.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you, Mr."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,Chair.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,Grady Trimble with Fox Business.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,And so that’s what all of us want to do.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,You’ve reiterated today and the Committee has reiterated its commitment to that 2 percent inflation target.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"That’s just—so, changing our inflation goal is just something we’re not thinking about, and it’s something we’re not going to think about."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s—we have a 2 percent inflation goal, and we’ll use our tools to get inflation back to 2 percent."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,I think this isn’t the time to be thinking about that.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mean, there may be a longer-run project at some point."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,But that is not where we are at all.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"I wonder, is there ever a point where you actually reevaluate that target and maybe increase your inflation target if it is stickier than even you think it is?"
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think, as the economy heals, the two goals come more into play."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,We want to get back to a long expansion where the labor market can remain strong over an extended period of time.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,And we’d love to get back to that.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,And we’re missing by a lot on the inflation side.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,Where we’re missing is on the inflation side.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"So the labor market’s very, very strong."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"You’re near a 50-year low where you’re at or above maximum employment, a 50-year low in unemployment, vacancies are very high, wages—nominal wages are very high."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"I’ve made it clear that right now, the labor market’s very, very strong."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,So let me just say that we have to use our tools to support maximum employment and price stability.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, you know, we’ll—it’s hard to deal with hypotheticals."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,So I don’t want to get into too many hypotheticals.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"What would you do if the economy slows so much that we enter a recession before we see strong consistent signs that inflation is slowing—in other words, stagflation?"
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,Nancy Marshall-Genzer with Marketplace.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,Hi.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,Nancy.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,We keep our eye on that.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,We do.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s what our goal is.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, there’s—in the near term, we have to use our tools to restore price stability."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"But we, you know, we can’t—what we have to think about is the medium and longer term."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"If you think about it, the country went through a difficult time—I think much more difficult than we can think it would happen here."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,But it really set up our economy for several decades of prosperity.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"So price stability is something that really pays dividends for the benefit of the economy and the people in it over a very, very long period of time."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s a really good thing for workers in the economy.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"And so when it is lost, for whatever reason, it has to be restored and as quickly as possible—which is what we’re doing."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"In the short term, are you factoring in these exacerbations or potential exacerbations in the economy?"
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,Are you monitoring them?
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"We do, yes."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,We absolutely do.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"We look at—it’s our regular practice to talk about unemployment rates by different groups, including racial groups and that sort of thing."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,NICOLE GOODKIND.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, that’s where you need to see—we believe you need to see a better balancing of supply and demand in the labor market so that you have—it’s not that we don’t want wage increases."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, our focus right now is really on moving our policy stance to one that is restrictive enough to ensure a return of inflation to our 2 percent goal over time."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"By the middle of next year, we should begin to see lower inflation from the housing services sector."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,Jeanna.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,And it could move down if inflation data are softer.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"Obviously, if data—if the inflation data come in worse, that could move up."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"What we’re writing down today is our best estimate of what we think that peak rate will be, based on what we know."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,It will depend on future data.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,I don’t know what we’ll do.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,So I can’t tell you confidently that we won’t move up our estimate of the peak rate again at the next SEP.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"And today we’re—the SEP that was published shows again that, overwhelmingly, FOMC participants believe that inflation risks are to the upside."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"You will also know that, at each subsequent SEP during the course of this year, we’ve actually increased our estimate of what that peak rate will be."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,So that’s our best assessment today for what we think the peak rate will be.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"As you will have seen, 19 people filled out the SEP this time, and 17 of those 19 wrote down a peak rate of 5 percent or more—in the 5s."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,And I would point you to the SEP again for our current assessment of what that peak level will be.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"I would say it’s our judgment today that we’re not at a sufficiently restrictive policy stance yet, which is why we say that we would expect that ongoing hikes would be appropriate."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,JEANNA SMIALEK.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"And many, many things, of course, move financial conditions over time."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"Financial conditions both anticipate, and react to, our actions."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,So what we control is our policy moves in the communications that we make.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"And those, in turn, affect economic activity, the labor market, and inflation."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,But our policy actions work through financial conditions.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,We think that financial conditions have tightened significantly in the past year.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, as I mentioned, it is important that overall financial conditions continue to reflect the policy restraint that we’re putting in place to bring inflation down to 2 percent."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,And how would you do something about that?
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, if so, do you need to do something about that?"
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"Is this loosening of financial conditions a problem for the Fed in its effort, and its fight, against inflation?"
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"Since the November meeting, the 10-year has declined by 60 basis points, mortgage rates have come down, high-yield credit spreads have come in, the economy’s accelerated, and the stock market’s up 6 percent."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,You just talked about the importance of market conditions reflecting the policy restraint you put in place.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thanks for taking my question, Mr. Chairman."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"I would add that our focus is not on short-term moves, but on persistent moves."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"Jeanna Smialek, New York Times."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks for taking our questions.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"The SEP, like you mentioned, suggests that the Fed will be making another ¾ percentage points worth of rate increases in 2023."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,But we see that the new leases that are—that the rate for new leases is coming down.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"As rents expire and have to be renewed, they’re going to be renewed into a market where rates are higher than they were when the original leases were signed."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"We know the story there is that housing services inflation has been very, very high and will continue to go up, actually."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,Then you go to housing services.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,We’re now starting to see that in this report and the last one.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,And we start to see goods inflation coming down.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, ultimately, supply chains get fixed, and demand settles down a little bit and maybe goes back to services a little bit."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"The first is goods inflation, and we see now, as we’ve been expecting, really, for a year and a half, that supply conditions would get better."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"If you look at—you can break inflation down into three, sort of, buckets."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"Now, why do I say that?"
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,And we think that that will be some time.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"And there, the strong view on the Committee is that we’ll need to stay there, you know, until we’re really confident that inflation is coming down in a sustained way."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"And then the question will be, how long do we stay there?"
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"At a certain point, though, we’ll get to that point."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,And we’ve laid out our own—our individual assessments of what we would need to do to get there.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"[As] I’ve told you today, we have an assessment that we’re not at a restrictive enough stance, even with today’s move."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, ultimately, that question about how high to raise rates is going to be one that we make looking at our progress on inflation, looking at where financial conditions are, and making an assessment of whether policy is restrictive enough."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"I wonder if you would foresee that being in 25 basis point increments, 50 basis point increments—sort of how you see the speed playing out going forward."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,And then I wonder what you’re looking at as you determine when to stop.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, as I’ve been saying, as we’ve gone through the course of this year, as we lifted off and got into the course of the year and we saw the—how strong inflation was and how persistent, it was very important to move quickly."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"In fact, the speed—the pace with which we’re moving was the most important thing."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think now that we’re coming to the end of this year, we’ve raised 425 basis points this year, and we’re into restrictive territory."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,STEVE LIESMAN.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s now not so important how fast we go.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"And then it’s—at a certain point, the question will become, how long do we remain restrictive?"
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,That will become the most important question.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,But I would say the most important question now is no longer the speed.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,So—and that applies to February as well.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I think we’ll make the February decision based on the incoming data and where we see financial conditions, where we see the economy."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"And that’ll be the key thing, but—I mean, for that decision."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s far more important to think, what is the ultimate level?"
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,Steve.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,I will look forward to your questions.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"In November, the 12-month change in the CPI was 7.1 percent, and the change in the core CPI was 6 percent."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"Over the 12 months ending in October, total PCE prices rose 6 percent; excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 5 percent."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,Inflation remains well above our longer-run goal of 2 percent.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,The median projection in the SEP for the unemployment rate rises to 4.6 percent at the end of next year.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"FOMC participants expect supply and demand conditions in the labor market to come into better balance over time, easing upward pressures on wages and prices."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,The labor force participation rate is little changed since the beginning of the year.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"Although job vacancies have moved below their highs and the pace of job gains has slowed from earlier in the year, the labor market continues to be out of balance, with demand substantially exceeding the supply of available workers."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"Job gains have been robust, with employment rising by an average of 272,000 jobs per month over the last three months."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"Despite the slowdown in growth, the labor market remains extremely tight, with the unemployment rate near a 50-year low, job vacancies still very high, and wage growth elevated."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"As shown in our Summary of Economic Projections, the median projection for real GDP growth stands at just 0.5 percent this year and next, well below the median estimate of the longer-run normal growth rate."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,Higher interest rates and slower output growth also appear to be weighing on business fixed investment.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"Activity in the housing sector has weakened significantly, largely reflecting higher mortgage rates."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"Growth in consumer spending has slowed from last year’s rapid pace, in part reflecting lower real disposable income and tighter financial conditions."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,Recent indicators point to modest growth of spending and production this quarter.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"Although real GDP rose at a pace of 2.9 percent last quarter, it is roughly unchanged through the first three quarters of this year."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,The U.S. economy has slowed significantly from last year’s rapid pace.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,I will have more to say about today’s monetary policy actions after briefly reviewing economic developments.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"And then, you know, the big question is, when we—how much will you see from the largest, the 55 percent of the index, which is the non-housing services sector?"
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"Transcript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference December 14, 2022 CHAIR POWELL."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,Good afternoon.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"Before I go into the details of today’s meeting, I would like to underscore for the American people that we understand the hardship that high inflation is causing and that we are strongly committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"Over the course of the year, we have taken forceful actions to tighten the stance of monetary policy."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"We have covered a lot of ground, and the full effects of our rapid tightening so far are yet to be felt."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,The inflation data received so far for October and November show a welcome reduction in the monthly pace of price increases.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"Even so, we have more work to do."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"Without price stability, the economy doesn’t work for anyone."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"In particular, without price stability, we will not achieve a sustained period of strong labor market conditions that benefit all."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"Today, the FOMC raised our policy interest rate by ½ percentage point."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,We continue to anticipate that ongoing increases will be appropriate in order to attain a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2 percent over time.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"In addition, we are continuing the process of significantly reducing the size of our balance sheet."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,Restoring price stability will likely require maintaining a restrictive policy stance for some time.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,Price stability is the responsibility of the Federal Reserve and serves as the bedrock of our economy.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, once we work our way through that backlog, that inflation will come down sometime next year."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,But it will take substantially more evidence to give confidence that inflation is on a sustained downward path.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,Russia’s war against Ukraine has boosted prices for energy and food and has contributed to upward pressure on inflation.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum-employment and price-stability goals.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,Everything we do is in service to our public mission.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"To conclude: We understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,We will stay the course until the job is done.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,The historical record cautions strongly against prematurely loosening policy.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,Restoring price stability is essential to set the stage for achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the longer run.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,Reducing inflation is likely to require a sustained period of below-trend growth and some softening of labor market conditions.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,Our overarching focus is using our tools to bring inflation back down to our 2 percent goal and to keep longer-term inflation expectations well anchored.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,We are taking forceful steps to moderate demand so that it comes into better alignment with supply.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,And we will continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting and communicate our thinking as clearly as possible.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,Our decisions will depend on the totality of incoming data and their implications for the outlook for economic activity and inflation.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"Of course, these projections do not represent a Committee decision or plan, and no one knows with any certainty where the economy will be a year or more from now."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"The median projection is 4.1 percent at the end of 2024 and 3.1 percent at the end of 2025, still above the median estimate of its longer-run value."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"As shown in the SEP, the median projection for the appropriate level of the federal funds rate is 5.1 percent at the end of next year, ½ percentage point higher than projected in September."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"Of course, 50 basis points is still a historically large increase, and we still have some ways to go."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"In light of the cumulative tightening of monetary policy and the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation, the Committee decided to raise interest rates by 50 basis points today, a step-down from the 75 basis point pace seen over the previous four meetings."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"The median projection in the SEP for total PCE inflation is 5.6 percent this year and falls to 3.1 percent next year, 2.5 percent in 2024, and 2.1 percent in 2025; participants continue to see risks to inflation as weighted to the upside."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"Despite elevated inflation, longer-term inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters as well as measures from financial markets."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"But that is not grounds for complacency; the longer the current bout of high inflation continues, the greater the chance that expectations of higher inflation will become entrenched."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,The Fed’s monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"My colleagues and I are acutely aware that high inflation imposes significant hardship as it erodes purchasing power, especially for those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"We are highly attentive to the risks that high inflation poses to both sides of our mandate, and we are strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent objective."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,Price pressures remain evident across a broad range of goods and services.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"At today’s meeting, the Committee raised the target range for the federal funds rate by ½ percentage point, bringing the target range to 4¼ to 4½ percent."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"With today’s action, we have raised interest rates by 4¼ percentage points this year."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,We continue to anticipate that ongoing increases in the target range for the federal funds rate will be appropriate in order to attain a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2 percent over time.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"Over the course of the year, financial conditions have tightened significantly in response to our policy actions."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"Financial conditions fluctuate in the short term in response to many factors, but it is important that, over time, they reflect the policy restraint that we are putting in place to return inflation to 2 percent."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"We are seeing the effects on demand in the most interest-sensitive sectors of the economy, such as housing."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"It will take time, however, for the full effects of monetary restraint to be realized, especially on inflation."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,And we are continuing the process of significantly reducing the size of our balance sheet.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"The third piece, which is something like 55 percent of the index, PCE core inflation index, is non-housing-related core services."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"Steve Liesman, CNBC."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"The biggest cost, by far, in that sector is labor."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"Again, that we’re going to find out empirically."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"And it means that it may take longer, but it also means that the costs in unemployment may be less."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"So the fact that there’s a strong labor market, you know, means that companies will hold on to workers."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mean, I think we’ve—it feels like we have a structural labor shortage out there where there are, you know, 4 million fewer people, a little more than 4 million who were in the workforce available to work than there’s demand for workforce."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,And we’re hearing from many companies that they don’t want to lay people off—so that they’ll keep people because it’s been so hard.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"First just is that there’s this huge overhang of vacancies, meaning that vacancies can come down a fair amount."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, I’ll give you a few reasons."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,But why do we think that is the case?
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"And history would, you know, would say that, in a situation like this, the declines in unemployment would be more meaningful, I think, than what you see written down there."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, there—you can look at history, right?"
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s very hard to say.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"Do you have a sense of, in order to get to that number, how much of that could be caused by layoffs versus vacancies, trimming, or changes to the labor force population rate?"
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,RACHEL SIEGEL.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"But that’s the idea, is slower progress on inflation, tighter policy, probably higher rates probably held for longer just to get to where you—the kind of restriction that you need to get inflation down to 2 percent."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"And so it didn’t go up by much in the meeting, I don’t think."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"And that’s why unemployment goes up, because we’re having to tighten policy more."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you for taking our questions.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,I’m wondering if we could talk about the projection for the unemployment rate.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,Why has the Fed raised its unemployment projection?
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,Is it because the model suggests that a higher terminal rate would automatically cause a higher unemployment rate?
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,Or are you seeing signs that the labor market isn’t quite as strong as we think it is now?
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,But I think that’s a reasonably possible outcome.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s not about the strength of the labor market.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,The labor market is clearly very strong.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"It is more just that, you know, by now, we had expected—we’ve continually expected to make faster progress on inflation than we have, ultimately."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,And that’s why the peak rate for this year goes up between this meeting and the September meeting.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,You see that—you see the fact that we’ve made less progress than expected on inflation.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,So that’s why that goes up.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,No.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,Rachel Siegel from the Washington Post.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"And you do hear, you know, many, many labor economists believe that it is."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"And that’s really a function of the labor market, largely."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, where’s it coming from?"
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,That would be—that’s a pretty significant drop in inflation.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,I believe the median is 3½ percent.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,So we’re getting down.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s just starting from a higher level at the end of 2022.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,I don’t think it’s having—I don’t think the policy is having any less effect.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, you know, we—we’re moving down still by a very large chunk."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,But remember that the jump[ing]-off point at the beginning of the year is higher.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we’re actually moving down to—the level that we’re moving down to next year is still a very large drop in inflation from where inflation is running now, well more than 1 percent change in inflation."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’re going into next year with higher inflation than we had thought, right?"
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I was just wondering, you know, given that we have seen some cooling in inflation, you know, is it—is that primarily because of wage growth, that you expect wage growth to be sort of a headwind?"
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"I wanted to make sure I understand specifically what’s going on in the SEP, because you all expect rates to go higher, but you’re also more pessimistic about what inflation is going to look like next year."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,Victoria Guida with Politico.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,Hi.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,VICTORIA GUIDA.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,Colby.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,COLBY SMITH.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,Colby Smith with the Financial Times.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,How should we interpret the higher core inflation forecast for 2023 in the SEP?
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,Does that not then suggest that the policy rate currently forecasted for next year should actually be higher than the 5.1 median estimate penciled in?
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we’ll see, though."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,Yeah.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"What you see is our best estimate, as of today—really, as of today—for how high we need to raise rates to—how much we need to tighten policy to create enough, you know, restrictive policy to slow economic activity and slow—soften the labor market and bring inflation down through those channels."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s all—that is the estimate—best estimate—we make today.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, as I mentioned, we’ll make another estimate for the next SEP. And we’ll, you know, of course, between meetings, we do the same thing, but we don’t publish it."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,Victoria.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"Well, I think that’s why one of the reasons it went up was that core came in stronger this year."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Chair Powell."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s coming from the goods sector, clearly."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,Rachel.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,We can never identify its location with great precision.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,So it’s not clear that those forecasts of inflation are really much above the natural rate of unemployment.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,I would say that many analysts believe that the natural rate of unemployment is actually elevated at this moment.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,Unemployment does go up a bit.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"In that condition, labor market conditions are softening a bit."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s going to feel like very slow growth, right?"
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s not going to feel like a boom.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s well below trend.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s slow growth.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"The expectations in the SEP are basically as you said, which is, we’ve got growth at a modest level, which is to say that ½ percentage point, that’s positive growth."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"I don’t think it would qualify as a recession, though, because you’ve got positive growth."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"Well, I’ll tell you what the projection is."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,Why wouldn’t this be considered a recessionary projection by the Fed?
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"But it’s nearly a full percentage point rise, and that’s well in excess of what has historically been associated with recession."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,You described labor market unemployment rate as representing some softening.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,Half a percentage point is not much.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,RACHEL SIEGEL.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"Vacancies are quite elevated, and, really, there’s an imbalance in the labor market between supply and demand."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"So that part of it, which is the biggest part, is likely to take a substantial period to get down."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"The other—you know, the goods inflation has turned pretty quickly now after not turning at all for a year and a half."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,Now it seems to be turning.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"But there’s an expectation, really, that the services inflation will not move down so quickly, so that we’ll have to stay at it, so that we may have to raise rates higher to get to where we want to go."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,But that 4.7 percent is still a strong labor market.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,And that’s really why we are writing down those high rates and why we’re expecting that they’ll have to remain high for a time.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,Howard.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,HOWARD SCHNEIDER.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,Howard Schneider with Reuters.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks for taking the question.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"You describe GDP growth in the SEPs as moderate or modest, I believe."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,Yet it’s really approaching stall speed.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"If you look—you know, you’ve got—the reports we get from the field are that companies are very reluctant to lay people off, other than the tech companies, which is, you know, a story unto itself."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we do see a very, very strong labor market, one where we haven’t seen much softening, where job growth is very high, where wages are very high."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,So you’ve got all these vacancies out there—far in excess of the number of employed people.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s never the case that the SEPs don’t reflect an important piece of data that came in on the first day of the meeting.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,But that’s not the case.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"And participants know that they have the—they know this—that they can make changes to their SEP during the meeting, you know, well in advance of the press conference so that we’re not running around."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"As a—just a matter of practice, the SEP reflects any data that’s—that comes out during the meeting."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,No.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,Absolutely not.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,No.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"Generally, companies want to hold onto the workers they have because it’s been very, very hard to hire."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"With the CPI report, if it did come out last week, do you think it would have changed some of those forecasts in today’s estimate?"
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,NICK TIMIRAOS.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"It will depend on a variety of factors, including the incoming data in particular, the state of the economy, the state of financial conditions."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, again, I can’t tell you today what the actual size of that will be."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"It makes a lot of sense, it seems to me—particularly if you consider how far we’ve come."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,So that’s the idea.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, you know, what you said is broadly right, which is, having moved so quickly and having now so much restraint that’s still in the pipeline, we think that the appropriate thing to do now is to move to a slower pace."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, that will allow us to feel our way and— you know, and get to that level, we think, and better balance the risks that we face."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"So that we—you know, there are channels through which the labor market can come back into balance with relatively modest increases in unemployment, we believe."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"None of that is guaranteed, but that is what their forecast reflects."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,Nick.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,NICK TIMIRAOS.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"That doesn’t sound like a—you know, a labor market where a lot of people will need to be put out of work."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"Chair Powell, I want to follow up on Jeanna’s question."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"The decision to step down the pace of rate increase—rate rises appears to have been socialized at your last meeting, largely before the past two CPI reports showed inflation decelerating in line with the Committee’s forecasts this year."
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,You just now talked about making decisions meeting by meeting and being mindful of the lags of policy.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"Does that mean, all things equal, you would feel more comfortable probing where the terminal rate is by moving in 25 basis point increments, including beginning at your next meeting?"
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,So I haven’t made a judgment on what size rate hike to make at the last meeting.
2022-12-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"Nick Timiraos, Wall Street Journal."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"As inflation does come down, sentiment will improve."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"You also—state and local governments are really flush these days with, you know, money, and many of them are considering tax cuts or even sending checks."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,So I think that’s going to support—they’re also spending a lot.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"There’s a lot of spending coming in the construction pipeline, both private and public."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,And so that’s going to support economic activity.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,So I think there’s a good chance that those factors will help support positive growth this year.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Okay, Rich."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,RICH MILLER.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Rich Miller from Bloomberg.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"First off, how are you doing?"
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"And that’s my base case, is that there will be positive growth this year."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"The labor market remains very, very strong, and that’s job creation, that’s wages."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,I think that’s a possible outcome.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"There are other factors, though, that need to be considered."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Edward Lawrence from Fox Business, by the way."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think many, many forecasters would say it’s not the most likely outcome."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,But I would say there’s a chance of it.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Michael.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHAEL MCKEE.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"You will have seen that the global picture is improving a bit, and that will matter for us, potentially."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Michael McKee from Bloomberg TV and Radio.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,And the recession indicators are all suggesting that we are going to see recession this year.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I’m wondering if you’ve changed your view or you have a more nuanced view of what you think the danger to economic growth is going forward and whether you’re very close to perhaps tipping it into the wrong place, which calls for more restraint on your part."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I do think you—most forecasts and, you know, my own assessment would be that that growth will continue—positive growth will continue but at a subdued pace as it did last year."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"We had growth of—GDP growth of 1 percent last year and also final sales growth, which we think is a better indicator, of about 1 percent."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think, you know, most forecasts and certainly my assessment would be that growth will continue at a fairly subdued level this year."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"I’d like to pick up on what you were just saying about a substantial downturn and ask, with the full weight of your tightening not in place yet and with the progress against inflation, there’s still a lot of talk about very, very slow growth going forward in 2023."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, the one we got, I guess it was yesterday, was some—was constructive."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,My base case is that the economy can return to 2 percent inflation without a really significant downturn or a really big increase in unemployment.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,So you’ve talked about we had solid job growth.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you, Fed Chairman, for taking the questions."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you, Michelle."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,EDWARD LAWRENCE.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Edward.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"And so we are strongly resolved that we will, you know, complete this task because we think it has benefits that will, you know, support economic activity and benefit the public for many, many years."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, you know, we have to deliver that."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"In fact, I did that job for years but in one form or another."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s a great job.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s a fine job.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,We’re not—market participants have a very different job.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"But I will say, though, we—you know, it is our job to restore price stability and achieve 2 percent inflation for the benefit of the American public."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I don’t want to put a number on it in terms of months, but as the accumulated evidence comes in, it’s going to be reflected in our assessment of the outlook, and that will be reflected in our policy over time."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,They’re still at a level that’s way above—well above where they were before the pandemic.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s—you know, it shows wages coming down but still at a high level."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Fine.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,RICH MILLER.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Good.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Second off, I think, earlier on in the press conference, you said you need to see substantially more evidence of inflation coming down."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Can you give us some idea of what you’re thinking of?
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,You mentioned three months—that we’ve seen three months in a row.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Fine.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Governor Waller suggested he might want to see six months.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I don’t think there’s, you know, going to be a light switch flipped or anything like that."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,I think it’s just an accumulating—accumulation of evidence.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, of course, we’ll be looking—by the time of the March meeting, we’ll have two more employment reports, two more CPI reports, and we’ll be looking at those carefully as all of us will."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we’ll be asking ourselves, what are they telling us?"
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"And soon after that, we’ll have another ECI wage report, which, as you know, is a report that we like because it adjusts for composition and it’s very complete."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"And so is it just the inflation data, or do you have to see the labor market coming back into better balance to have that “substantially more evidence” metric?"
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,But I don’t—that’s not my base case.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,So that’s really where the sustainable level is.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,I think it’s because this is not like the other business cycles in so many ways.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,So a couple of things.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,The idea that it may not require unemployment rising to get this sector of inflation under control.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, specifically, I wonder if you might comment on the speech given by Vice Chair Lael Brainard, who said, “To the extent that inputs other than wages may be responsible in part for important price increases for some nonhousing services, an unwinding of these factors.” In other words, it may not be wages."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"I’m wondering if you’ve considered the idea of whether or not your understanding of the inflation dynamic may be wrong, and it’s possible to achieve these things without raising rates that high and also without the surge in unemployment."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"And you’ve also achieved it without the 1 percentage point increase in the unemployment rate, which you have penciled in for this year."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Meanwhile, the three-month annualized PCE is 2.1 percent, and you’ve achieved this without going to your 5.1 percent funds rate, which is what you have penciled in for this year."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Mr. Chairman, the SEP has the PCE inflation rate in 2023 at 3.1 percent."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Steve Liesman, CNBC."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,STEVE LIESMAN.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Steve.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,But this is not something that the Federal Open Market Committee is on the point of deciding right now.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I mean, you saw what the Bank of Canada did and, you know, they left it that they’re willing to raise rates after pausing."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,So I think a lot of options are available.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"In principle, though, you know, we used to—the thing we used to do was go every other meeting, if you remember, 25 basis points, and that was considered a fast pace."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"We had solid job growth, a slight falling in the increase in consumer spending."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,And I wonder if that view is broadly shared on the Committee.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,So the Committee obviously did not see this as the time to pause.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"We judged that the appropriate, you know, thing to do at this meeting was to raise the federal funds rate by 25 basis points."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,And we said that we continue to anticipate that ongoing increases in the target range will be appropriate in order to attain that stance of sufficiently restrictive monetary policy that will bring inflation down to 2 percent.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"First, on the forecast, if—you’re right—if you take very short-term three-month, say, measures of PCE—core PCE inflation, they’re quite low right now."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,So that’s the judgment that we made.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,JEANNA SMIALEK.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Sorry, I should have been clearer."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mean, would it be possible to take a meeting off, for example, and then resume?"
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, could you, rather than just doing at every meeting that move, go a little bit more slowly, take some gaps in between moves?"
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mean, I think this is not something that the Committee is thinking about or exploring in any kind of detail."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, we’re going to write down new forecasts in March, and we’ll—you know, we’ll certainly be looking at the incoming data as everyone else will."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"It may well be that as—yeah, as—that it will take more slowing than we expect—than I expect to get inflation down to 2 percent."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"But that’s because that’s driven by, you know, significantly negative readings from goods inflation."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"So a lot of forecasts would call for core PCE to go back up to 4 percent by the middle of the year, for example."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, it’s a question—no one really knows."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Absolutely it’s possible.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Yeah.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Certainly possible.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Can we get there with 5 percent?
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,STEVE LIESMAN.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,So we’ll have to see.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"But I think there is— there’s ongoing disinflation, and we don’t yet see weakening in the labor market."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,And I think will—a story will emerge on the nonhousing services sector soon enough.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"And so now we see goods inflation coming down for the reasons we thought, and we understand why housing inflation will come down."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"The inflation that we originally got was very much a collision between very strong demand and hard supply constraints, not something that you really have seen in prior— you know, in prior business cycles."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"And that’s because the—you know, the setting we’re in is quite different."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,But I still think—I continue to think that there’s a path to getting inflation back down to 2 percent without a really significant economic decline or a significant increase in unemployment.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,I think most forecasters would say that unemployment will probably rise a bit from here.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"And so far, we’ve got—as I mentioned, in goods, we have inflation moving down without the softening in the labor market."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,I do think there are a number of dimensions through which the labor market can soften.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s more like at 4 percent.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,So that would suggest there’s work left to do.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, let’s say inflation does come down much faster than we expect, which is possible."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"As I mentioned, you know, obviously our policy is data dependent."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,We would take that into account.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"In terms of the non—sorry, the core nonhousing services, as I mentioned earlier, it’s a very diverse sector, six or seven sectors."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Most forecasters would think that the significantly negative readings will be transitory and that goods inflation will move up fairly soon, back up to its longer-run trend of something around zero, something like that."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"And so sectors that represent 55 or 60 percent of that— subsectors of that sector are—we think are sensitive to slack in the economy, sensitive to the labor market in a way, but some of the other sectors are not."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"So that’s why I said there are a number of things that will affect—take restaurants, right?"
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, clearly, labor is important for restaurants but so are food prices."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, transportation services is going to be driven by fuel prices, for example."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,So there are lots of things in that mix that will drive inflation.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"I would say overall, though, my own view would be that you’re not going to have, you know, a sustainable return to 2 percent inflation in that sector without a better balance in the labor market."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I don’t know what that will require in terms of increased unemployment, your question."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, for example, you know, financial services is a big sector that’s really not driven by labor markets—wages."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,It seems so far it’s been relatively mild from the economy to go to—from a 9.1 percent CPI inflation to 6.5 percent CPI inflation.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Lorie Logan from the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas seemed to suggest that would be a possibility in a recent speech.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Greg.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,And it’s a very positive thing.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"The fact that people now do generally believe that it will come down, that’ll be part of the process of getting it down."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,That's immeasurably helpful to the process of getting inflation down.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think, you know, the markets have decided, and the public has decided, that inflation is going to come back down to 2 percent and it’s just a matter of us following through."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"So it’s, you know—and that’s—I think that’s very reassuring."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Expectations are—seem to be well anchored, including at the shorter end now, not just the longer end."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,We moved quite vigorously last year.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, in this case, I would say, the risk eight months ago or so, longer-term inflation expectations had moved up."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,We think it’s important.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"In one way or another, it has to be."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s a sort of bedrock belief.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"That’s at the very heart, is consumers and businesses that, you know, are the—essentially, we believe that expectations of future inflation are a very important part of the process of creating inflation."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,GREG ROBB.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I think once inflation is seen to be coming down in coming months, even you will also see a boost to sentiment, I hope."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"It has to be inflation, right?"
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you very much.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Why can that be?
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"You look at the sentiment surveys now, and they’re very, very low with 3½ percent unemployment and, you know, high wage increases nominally by historical standards."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"And as we see it coming down, that could also add a boost to economic activity."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,People really don’t like inflation.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I’ve seen some data, too, that show people are, you know, gradually—they’re glad that inflation is coming down."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"And people are—you know, we pick that up in conversations."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"By the way, I think it’s becoming less salient."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,It always has been more of a risk than anything else.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"But no, there’s not much—it’s more of a risk."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, so that’s why we worry that the longer we’re at this and the longer people are talking about inflation all day long, every day, you know, the more risk of something like that."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"So that’s what you’re looking at most closely, is consumer expectations?"
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you, Chair Powell."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Greg Robb from MarketWatch.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"In the minutes of the December meeting, there was a couple of sentences that struck people as important, when the Committee said participants talked about this unwarranted easing of financial conditions was a risk and it would make your life harder to bring inflation down."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,We’ll just be monitoring it.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,We’re watching it carefully.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,We understand all that.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,And we understand there’ll be lots of flows between there and the overnight repo facility and reserves.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"For example, the Treasury General Account will shrink down, and then it will grow back up."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, we, of course, will monitor money market conditions carefully as—you know, as the process moves on."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,I believe it will happen.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,I believe that that will happen.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I think the answer is, basically, I don’t think there’s likely to be any important interaction between the two, because I believe Congress will wind up acting, and—as it will and must, in the end, to raise the debt ceiling in a way that doesn’t risk, you know, the progress we’re making against inflation and the economy and the financial sector."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Look, I—it’s very hard to think about all the different possible ramifications."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Could it play in effect as we get closer to that drop-dead deadline this summer?
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"I wanted to ask if the Fed takes into account at all the debt ceiling when it comes to quantitative tightening, given the fact that rapid or faster quantitative tightening could bring us closer, faster to that drop-dead debt ceiling deadline."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Brendon Pedersen with Punchbowl News.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Chair Powell."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,BRENDAN PEDERSEN.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Brendan, for the last question."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,I haven’t seen—heard you talk much about that today or in the statement.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I was wondering, has that concern eased among members, or is that still something you’re concerned about?"
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,I would put it this way.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s something that we monitor carefully.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,And once that happens— that’s what we can’t allow to happen.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Financial conditions didn’t really change much from the December meeting to now.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s important that the markets do reflect the tightening that we’re putting in place.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"As we’ve discussed a couple times here, there’s a difference in perspective by some market measures on how fast inflation will come down."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,We’re just going to have to see.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mean, I’m not going to try to persuade people to have a different forecast, but our forecast is that it will take some time and some patience and that we’ll need to keep rates higher for longer."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,But we’ll see.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,They mostly went sideways or up and down but came out in roughly the same place.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"That means that, effectively, in people’s decisionmaking, inflation has become a really salient issue."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"But the whole point is, you know, if you—once you see it, you have a serious problem."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,You don’t see that yet.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Are you concerned about that divergence or do you think, if everything breaks right, is that a plausible outcome?"
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"If you look at fed fund and futures pricing, the implication is that you’ll raise rates one more time and then pause."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"May I ask a further question about the language around “ongoing increases?” That, of course, implies at least two further rate rises."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Simon Rabinovitch with the Economist.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you, Chair Powell."

2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, if that happens—inflation comes down much faster, you know, then we’ll be seeing that, and it will be incorporated into our thinking about policy."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Of course, other people have forecasts with inflation coming down much faster, that’s a different thing."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, in that case, if the economy performs broadly in line with those expectations, it will not be appropriate to cut rates this year, to loosen policy this year."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, so—again, my forecast and that of my colleagues as you will see from the SEP and—I mean, there are many different forecasts, but, generally, it’s a forecast of slower growth, some softening in labor market conditions, and inflation moving down steadily but not quickly."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Do you—how long do you see then, the federal funds rate remaining at this elevated level?"
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,EDWARD LAWRENCE.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s all.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"I don’t think we know, honestly."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, the—so we, of course, expected goods inflation to start coming down by the end of 2021, and it didn’t come down all through ’22."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"And now it’s coming down, and it’s come down pretty fast."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,So I would say these are—this is not a standard business cycle where you can look at the last 10 times there was a global pandemic and we shut the economy down and Congress did what it did and we did what we did.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s just—it’s unique.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,So I think certainty is just not appropriate here.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"I’m not particularly concerned about the divergence, no, because it is largely due to the market’s expectation that inflation will move down more quickly."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Inflation—it’s just harder to forecast inflation.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,It may take longer to come down.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, our job is to deliver inflation back to target, and we will do that."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"But I think we’re going to be cautious about declaring victory and, you know, sending signals that we think that the game is won because, you know, it’s—we’ve got a long way to go."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s just—it’s the early stages of disinflation.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"And it’s most welcome to be able to say that we are now in disinflation, but that’s great."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,But we just see that it has to spread through the economy and that it’s going to take some time.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,It may come down faster.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Is the hard part yet to come to go from 6.5 to 2?
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,I think that’s the bigger part of that.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we have inflation moving down, you know, into the—somewhere in the mid-threes or maybe lower than that this year."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Yeah, I do."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,I do.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"She said she doesn’t see signs of a wage–price spiral, and I’m wondering if you agree with that."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,I wanted to go back to another thing that Fed Vice Chair Lael Brainard said recently.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Nancy Marshall-Genzer with Marketplace.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Chair Powell."

2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"It doesn’t really need to be in a—you know, in the Fed’s monthly, you know, postmeeting statement as an ongoing economic risk as opposed to, you know, a health issue."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"There’s never a perfect time, but we thought that—you know, people are handling it better, and the economy and the society are handling it better now."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, we’ve kept that statement in there for quite a while, and I think we just—we knew we would take it out at some point."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Look, we understand—I personally understand well that COVID is still out there, but that it’s no longer playing an important role in our economy."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s the general sense of it.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Does the Federal Reserve no longer see the pandemic as weighing on the economy?
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’ll update that in March, but that’s what we thought in December."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Markets are past that.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"They show inflation coming down, in some cases, much quicker than that."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,So we’ll just have to see.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we have a different view and—a different view, it’s a different forecast, really."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"And given our outlook, I just—I don’t see us cutting rates this year if we get—if our outlook turns true, as I mentioned just now."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, again, as I just mentioned, we—you know, our forecasts— different participants have different forecasts, but, generally, those forecasts are for continued subdued growth, some softening in the labor market but not a recession, not a recession."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"If we do see inflation coming down much more quickly, that’ll play into our policy setting, of course."

2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Scott Horsley from NPR.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,One of the changes in the statement this month is that the Committee is no longer listing public health as among the data points you’ll consider in assessing conditions.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,What should we make of that?
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"I wonder, was there any discussion today of the possibility of pausing rate increases and then restarting them?"

2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"So—but, you know, we’ll update those forecasts in March."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"I will say that it is gratifying to see the disinflationary process now getting under way, and we continue to get strong labor market data."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’re going to write down new forecasts at the March meeting, and we’ll see at that time."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,No.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Has your expectation for where the unemployment rate might go changed since December?
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,RACHEL SIEGEL.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Go ahead.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,You and some of your colleagues have emphasized the possibility that job openings could come down and that would let some of the air out of the labor market without major job losses.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Has your—I’m sorry.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"But I would say that, so far, what we see is progress but without any weakening in labor market conditions."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"The issue is that we have a large sector called nonhousing service—core nonhousing services, where we don’t see disinflation yet."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, in those two sectors, you’ve got a good story."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"In the other—in the housing services sector, we expect inflation to continue moving up for a while but then to come down, assuming that [rent increases associated with] new leases continue to be lower."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,So you see that.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"What you see is, really, in the goods sector you see inflation now coming down because supply chains have been fixed, demand is shifting back to services, and shortages have been abated."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,But I would also say that that disinflationary process that you now see under way is really at an early stage.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,So I would say it is a good thing that the disinflation that we have seen so far has not come at the expense of a weaker labor market.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Does this, at all, change your view of how much the unemployment rate would need to go up, if at all, to see inflation come down to the levels you’re looking for?"
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Over the last quarter, we’ve seen a deceleration in prices, in wages, and a fall in consumer spending, all while the unemployment rate has been able to stay at a historic low."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Rachel Siegel from the Washington Post.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Chair Powell, thank you for taking our questions."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,RACHEL SIEGEL.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,RACHEL SIEGEL.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,We saw the opposite in the December JOLTS this morning.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Job openings are actually rising.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,That also coincided with slowdown in wage inflation.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,I don’t feel a lot of certainty about where that will be.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think, you know, we’re going to be looking carefully at the incoming data between now and the March meeting and then the May meeting."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,We haven’t made a decision on exactly where that will be.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,I would say we still think there’s work to do there.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"We think we’ve covered a lot of ground, and financial conditions have certainly tightened."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"We did, however, continue to say that we believe ongoing rate hikes will be appropriate to attain a sufficiently restrictive stance of policy to bring inflation back down to 2 percent."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,We did not update them today.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"At the March meeting, we’re going to update those assessments."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,And the median for that was between 5 and 5¼ percent.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"At the December meeting, we all wrote down our best estimates of what we thought the ultimate level would be, and that’s obviously back in December."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,So you’re right.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Or does ongoing now mean more than two rate rises now?
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Given the economic data since the December meeting, is the trajectory for the fed funds rate in the most recent SEP still the best guidepost for the policy path forward?"
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Colby Smith with the Financial Times.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,COLBY SMITH.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Do you believe that openings are an important indicator to be studying to understand where the labor market is and where wage inflation might be heading?
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"So you’re right about the data, of course."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,What we did see—we’ve seen average hourly earnings and now the employment cost index abating a little bit still off of their highs of six months ago and more but still at levels that are fairly elevated.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"The job openings number has—in JOLTS, has been quite volatile recently."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Yeah, I did see that it moved up—back up this morning."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Rachel.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,I do think that it’s probably an important indicator.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"So it’s an indicator, but nonetheless, we—you’re right, we do see wages moving down."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"If you look across the rest of the labor market, you still see very high payroll job creation."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, quits are still at an elevated level."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"So many, many—by many, many indicators, the job market is still very strong."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Colby, and then Howard."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"The ratio, I guess, is back up to 1.9 job openings to unemployed people, people who are looking for work."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,It could certainly be higher than we’re writing down right now.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Of course, many things affect financial conditions—not just our policy."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Although inflation has moderated recently, it remains too high."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,But that’s not grounds for complacency.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Despite elevated inflation, longer-term inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters, as well as measures from financial markets."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, while recent developments are encouraging, we will need substantially more evidence to be confident that inflation is on a sustained downward path."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,The inflation data received over the past three months show a welcome reduction in the monthly pace of increases.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Over the 12 months ending in December, total PCE prices rose 5.0 percent; excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 4.4 percent."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Inflation remains well above our longer-run goal of 2 percent.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Labor demand substantially exceeds the supply of available workers, and the labor force participation rate has changed little from a year ago."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Although the pace of job gains has slowed over the course of the past year and nominal wage growth has shown some signs of easing, the labor market continues to be out of balance."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Job gains have been robust, with employment rising by an average of 247,000 jobs per month over the last three months."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Despite the slowdown in growth, the labor market remains extremely tight, with the unemployment rate at a 50-year low, job vacancies still very high, and wage growth elevated."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Higher interest rates and slower output growth also appear to be weighing on business fixed investment.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Consumer spending appears to be expanding at a subdued pace, in part reflecting tighter financial conditions over the past year."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Recent indicators point to modest growth of spending and production this quarter.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"The longer the current bout of high inflation continues, the greater the chance that expectations of higher inflation will become entrenched."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"The U.S. economy slowed significantly last year, with real GDP rising at a below-trend pace of 1 percent."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Restoring price stability will likely require maintaining a restrictive stance for some time.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"In addition, we are continuing the process of significantly reducing the size of our balance sheet."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,We continue to anticipate that ongoing increases will be appropriate in order to attain a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2 percent over time.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Today, the FOMC raised our policy interest rate by 25 basis points."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"In particular, without price stability, we will not achieve a sustained period of labor market conditions that benefit all."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Without price stability, the economy does not work for anyone."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Price stability is the responsibility of the Federal Reserve and serves as the bedrock of our economy.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Even so, we have more work to do."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"We have covered a lot of ground, and the full effects of our rapid tightening so far are yet to be felt."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Over the past year, we have taken forceful actions to tighten the stance of monetary policy."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"My colleagues and I understand the hardship that high inflation is causing, and we are strongly committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Good afternoon, and welcome."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Transcript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference February 1, 2023 CHAIR POWELL."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks for taking our questions.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,I will have more to say about today’s monetary policy actions after briefly reviewing economic developments.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,The Fed’s monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"My colleagues and I are acutely aware that high inflation imposes significant hardship, as it erodes purchasing power, especially for those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"We are highly attentive to the risks that inflation poses to both sides of our mandate, and we are strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent objective."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"And it is our judgment that we’re not yet at a sufficiently restrictive policy stance, which is why we say that we expect ongoing hikes will be appropriate."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,I would say that our focus is not on short-term moves but on sustained changes to broader financial conditions.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, of course, financial conditions have tightened very significantly over the past year."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,So it is important that overall financial conditions continue to reflect the policy restraint that we’re putting in place in order to bring inflation down to 2 percent.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,And could you see lifting rates higher than you otherwise would to offset the increase in—or to offset the easing of financial conditions?
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Does that make your job of combating inflation harder?
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"As you know, financial conditions have loosened since the fall with bond yields falling, which has also brought down mortgage rates, and the stock market posted a solid gain in January."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you for doing this.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Chris Rugaber, the Associated Press."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,CHRISTOPHER RUGABER.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you, and I look forward to your questions."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum-employment and price-stability goals.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Everything we do is in service to our public mission.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"To conclude, we understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"We will stay the course, until the job is done."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"At today’s meeting, the Committee raised the target range for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points, bringing the target range to 4½ to 4¾ percent."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,And we are continuing the process of significantly reducing the size of our balance sheet.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"With today’s action, we have raised interest rates by 4½ percentage points over the past year."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,We continue to anticipate that ongoing increases in the target range for the federal funds rate will be appropriate in order to attain a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2 percent over time.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"We are seeing the effects of our policy actions on demand in the most interest-sensitive sectors of the economy, particularly housing."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"It will take time, however, for the full effects of monetary restraint to be realized, especially on inflation."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,And we will take into account overall financial conditions along with many other factors as we set policy.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"In light of the cumulative tightening of monetary policy and the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation, the Committee decided to raise interest rates by 25 basis points today, continuing the step-down from last year’s rapid pace of increases."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"We will continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting, taking into account the totality of incoming data and their implications for the outlook for economic activity and inflation."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,We have been taking forceful steps to moderate demand so that it comes into better alignment with supply.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Our overarching focus is using our tools to bring inflation back down to our 2 percent goal and to keep longer-term inflation expectations well anchored.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Reducing inflation is likely to require a period of below-trend growth and some softening of labor market conditions.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Restoring price stability is essential to set the stage for achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the longer run.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,The historical record cautions strongly against prematurely loosening policy.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Shifting to a slower pace will better allow the Committee to assess the economy’s progress toward our goals as we determine the extent of future increases that will be required to attain a sufficiently restrictive stance.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"If we come to the view that we need to write down to, you know, to move rates up beyond what we said in December, we would certainly do that."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Activity in the housing sector continues to weaken, largely reflecting higher mortgage rates."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,COLBY SMITH.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Did you or your colleagues discuss the conditions for a pause at this meeting this week?
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,NICK TIMIRAOS.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,We’re going to be carefully watching the economy and watching inflation and watching the progress of the disinflationary process.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we’re going to—you know, that’s why we’re slowing down to 25 basis points."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s all.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,We’re trying to make a fine judgment about how much is restrictive enough.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,I think policy is restrictive.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"I would look across the rate—the spectrum of rates and see that real rates are now positive by— you know, by an appropriate set of measures are positive across the yield curve."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I think we’re—you know, we’re living in a world of significant uncertainty."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,We don’t know that.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"We don’t know that, though."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, I mean, I think our assessment is that we’re not very far from that level."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,housing yet.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"We—you know, you’ll see that the minutes will come out in three weeks, and we’ll give you a lot of detail."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, again, we don’t see it affecting the services sector ex."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’re, of course, taking into account long and variable lags, and we’re thinking about that."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"We think, because inflation is still running very hot."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,And why do we think that’s probably necessary?
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we’ve—you know, we’ve raised rates 4½ percentage points, and we’re talking about a couple of more rate hikes to get to that level we think is appropriately restrictive."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Why not stop here and see what transpires in the coming months before raising rates again?
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Given that, and given how much you did over the last year, why do you think further rate increases are needed?"
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,And we have learned lately that inflation can come down from its uncomfortably high level despite a historically low unemployment rate.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Chair Powell, you observed several years ago that we learned we can have a low unemployment rate without above-target inflation."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Nick Timiraos, the Wall Street Journal."

2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Nick.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, that’s what we’re here for."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"It really—the story we’re telling about inflation is to ourselves, and the way we understand it is basically the three things that I’ve just gone through a couple of times."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"I—you know, we spend a lot of time talking about the path ahead and the state of the economy."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I wouldn’t want to start to drive the—describe all the details there, but that was the sense of the discussion, was really talking quite a bit about the path forward."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"At the same time, if the data come in, in the other direction, then we’ll, you know, we’ll make data-dependent decisions at coming meetings, of course."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,JEANNA SMIALEK.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Jeanna and then Steve.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,So we’re the fiscal agent.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,We’re not involved in those discussions.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I gather there are discussions happening, but they don’t involve us."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"This is a matter that’s to be resolved between, really—it’s really Congress’ job to raise the debt ceiling."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,I’m just going to leave it at that.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,VICTORIA GUIDA.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,And I’m just going to leave it at that.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"In terms of our relationship with the Treasury, we are their fiscal agent."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,And any deviations from that path would be highly risky and that no one should assume that the Fed can protect the economy from the consequences of failing to act in a timely manner.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"There’s only one way forward here, and that is for Congress to raise the debt ceiling so that the United States government can pay all of its obligations when due."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,So I feel like I have to say this.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Okay.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Victoria.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,VICTORIA GUIDA.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Chair Powell."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,I wanted to ask about the debt ceiling.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Given that we’ve now hit up against it, I was wondering if the U.S. goes past the X date, will the Fed do whatever the Treasury directs as it relates to making payments as the fiscal agent or will it do its own analysis of any legal constraints?"
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,And we’re just going to have to—we have to complete the job.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"So your question is, would we—say your question again."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Will the Fed do what Treasury directs as it relates to making payments or will it do its own analysis of any legal constraints?
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"So you’re really asking about—you’re asking about prioritization, in effect, is what— VICTORIA GUIDA."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Yes.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Yes.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,VICTORIA GUIDA.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Until we do, I think we—you know, we see ourselves, we’ve got to be honest with ourselves, but we see ourselves as having perhaps more persistent—we’ll see more persistent inflation in that sector, which will take longer to get down."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Are you actively doing any planning of what might happen in the event that that would happen?
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,We’re just telling you that we don’t see inflation moving down yet in that large sector.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,You’ve taken out references to the war in Ukraine that’s causing price increases.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,You’re saying inflation has eased That’s new.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,The statement made a number of changes that seem to be saying things are getting better.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,So I just wanted to connect a couple of dots here.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Howard Schneider with Reuters, and thanks as usual."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,HOWARD SCHNEIDER.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Howard.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I think until we do, we see ourselves as having a lot of work left to do."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, so far, we don’t see that."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"There are many, many factors driving inflation in that sector, and they should be coming into play to have inflation—the disinflationary process begin in that sector."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,And how do we get that done?
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"We need to see—our goal, of course, is to bring inflation down."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,So I think it would be premature—it would be very premature to declare victory or to think that we’ve really got this.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, for the third sector, we don’t see anything here."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"In the other two sectors representing, you know, less than 50 percent, you actually, I think, now have a story that is credible, that’s coming together, although you don’t actually see disinflation yet in housing services, but it’s in the pipeline, right?"
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,So there’s not—nothing happening there.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Just as a quick follow-up, how are you viewing the kind of balance of risk between those two options of, you know, the likelihood of maybe falling short of that or going beyond that level?"
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think we will fairly soon, but we don’t see it yet."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,I guess I would say it this way.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,I continue to think that it’s very difficult to manage the risk of doing too little and finding out in 6 or 12 months that we actually were close but didn’t get the job done.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Inflation springs back, and we have to go back in."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,You’ve taken out references to the pandemic.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"And now, you really do worry about expectations getting unanchored and that kind of thing."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I do think that, in this situation, where we have still the highest inflation in 40 years, you know, the job is not fully done."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"As I started to mention earlier, we have a sector that represents 56 percent of the core inflation index where we don’t see disinflation yet."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,So we don’t see it.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s not happening yet.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Inflation in the core services ex.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,housing is still running at 4 percent on a 6- and 12-month basis.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"But we, you know, if we feel like we’ve gone too far, we can certainly—and inflation is coming down faster than we expect, then we have tools that would work on that."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"You’ve eliminated all the reasons that you said prices were being driven higher, yet that’s not mapping to any change in how you describe policy."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"This is a very difficult risk to manage, whereas I—of course, we have no incentive and no desire to overtighten."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I’m wondering, why is that the case?"
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,So this is good.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,And we note that when we say inflation is coming down that this is good.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"We expect to see that that disinflation process will be seen, we hope soon, in the core goods ex."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"housing—sorry, the core services ex."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,housing sector that I talked about.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,We don’t see it yet.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we actually see disinflation in the goods sector, and we see it in the pipeline for two sectors that amount to a little less than half."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s—you know, it’s seven or eight different kinds of services, not all of them are the same."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Some of the other ones it’s—the labor market is not going to be important.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Many other factors will drive it.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"In any case, we don’t see disinflation in that sector yet."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,So it’s not that we’re not—we’re neither optimistic nor pessimistic.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,We still have ongoing increases to come.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I think we need to see that it’s the majority of the core PCE index, which is the thing that we think is the best predictor of headline PCE, which is [the price series that we associate with] our mandate."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, we have a sense of what’s going on in each of those different subsections."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,So we think that that’s sort of in the pipeline.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Probably the biggest part of it, probably 60 percent of that is, you know, research would show is sensitive to slack in the economy and so the labor market will probably be important."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we—as I mentioned, with housing services, we expect, and other forecasters expect, that measured inflation will continue moving up for several months but will then come down, assuming that [rent increases associated with] new leases continue to be soft."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,And we do assume that.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,So I guess I would say it this way.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"We can now say, I think, for the first time that the disinflationary process has started."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,We can see that.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Goods prices is a big sector.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"We—this is what we thought would happen since the very beginning, and now here it is actually happening, and for the reasons we thought."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we see it, really, in goods prices so far."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,So this is a good thing.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,And does it have more to do with uncertainty around the outlook or more to do with you not wanting to give a very overeager market a reason to get ahead of itself and overreact?
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"So the second sector is housing services, and that’s driven by very different things."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"We—you know, it’s supply chains, it’s shortages, and it’s demand revolving back towards services."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"But that’s, you know, around a quarter of the PCE price index—core PCE price index."
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-02-01,Press Conf - Full Text,This is a good thing.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,We’ll find ourselves at that place.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"First of all, I’m curious at what point the financial supports that the Fed is extending through the discount window and through its enhanced lending facility might be at odds with the objective of reducing the balance sheet."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,And I’m also curious what your thoughts are on the—not just the availability of reserves but the distribution of them throughout the banking system and at what point you might be concerned about it being scarce for certain banks.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"So—People think of QE and QT in different ways, so let me be clear about how I’m thinking about these recent developments."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,Kyle Campbell with American Banker.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Chair Powell—thanks for taking the question."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,KYLE CAMPBELL.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,Kyle.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,I have a couple questions about the balance sheet.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,And we’ll also be watching what’s happening with inflation and in the labor market.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"We know that can have, you know, an effect on the macroeconomy, on demand, on labor market, on inflation, and we’re—we’re going to be watching to see what that is."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think for now though we, we—as I’ve mentioned, we see the likelihood of, of credit tightening."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"No, we, if we need to raise hike—raise rates higher, we will."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"No, absolutely not."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"Do you feel, though, that if inflation remains high, you’ll be able to resume additional hikes as needed, or have you somewhat tied your hands here with these signals about rate hikes coming to an end?"
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"The SEB—SEP suggests one more rate hike, as does the change in the language in the statement and which suggests that you’re perhaps nearing the end of a cycle of rate hikes."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,Chris Rugaber at Associated Press.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,So the recent liquidity provision that has increased the size of our balance sheet but the intent and the effects of it are very different from what we—from when we expand our balance sheet through purchases of longer-term securities.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,CHRIS RUGABER.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"Okay, Chris Rugaber."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we’ll be watching all those things, and of course we will—we will eventually get to [a] tight enough policy to bring inflation down to 2 percent."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"Large-scale purchases of long-term securities are, are really meant to alter the stance of policy by pushing down—pushing up the price and down the rates, longer-term rates, which supports demand through channels we understand fairly well."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"Can you talk a little bit more about that discussion—kind of what was talked about in light of that, and then why didn’t the Fed, you know, do anything about that at that point to ultimately prevent, you know, what happened this month?"
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,We do believe that it’s working.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,I will have to come back to you on that.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,Can you confirm whether or not the Board knew about these escalations by the examiners in San Francisco?
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,CATARINA SARAIVA.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mean, one thing is the speed of the—I’ll come back to that, the speed of the run, it’s very different from what we’ve seen in the past, and it does kind of suggest that there’s a need for possible, you know, regulatory and supervisory changes just because supervision and regulation need to keep up with what’s, what’s happening in the world."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,And so that’s really the purpose of—one way to think about the review that Vice Chair Barr is conducting is to try to understand how that happened and try to understand how we can do better and what policies we need to change.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"I, I think, as you know, as is now in the public record, the supervisory team was apparently engaged, very much engaged with the bank repeatedly, and was escalating but, you know, nonetheless, what happened happened."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"So that’s, that’s not a surprise."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s not a surprise that there are institutions that have—that have had unhedged long positions in long- duration securities that have lost value as, as longer-term rates have gone up due to our rate increases."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mean, it’s been in all the newspapers."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, but I will tell you, though, that we have—there have been presentations about, about interest rate risk."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s been quite an interesting seven weeks.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mean, to be honest, I don’t—I don’t recall the specifics of that."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"The minutes of the January–February meeting, the last meeting, indicate that you discussed the possibility of runs on nonbank financial institutions and the impact of large unrealized losses on bank portfolios."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,Catarina Saraiva with Bloomberg News.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Chair."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,CATARINA SARAIVA.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,Catarina.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,But we don’t see any evidence that that’s changed.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"And of course we’re, we’re always prepared to, to change that if that changes."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"We, we think that our program of allowing our balance sheet to, to run off predictably, predicatbly and passively is working."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"In terms of the distribution of reserves, we, we don’t see ourselves as, as running into reserve shortages."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,So that’s working.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s having its intended effect of bolstering confidence in the banking system and thereby forestalling what might otherwise have been an abrupt and outsized tightening in financial conditions.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,The balance sheet expansion is really temporary lending to banks to meet those special liquidity demands created by the recent tensions; it’s not intended to directly alter the stance of monetary policy.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"So that’s where the funds came from, and it’s—it’s a loan that’s 100 percent guaranteed by the FDIC, so there’s no risk in it for us."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,EDWARD LAWRENCE.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s only available in unusual and exigent circumstances, and it has to be— meet certain requirements, but it seemed to be the right place."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,Edward.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, of course, we welcome that."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we welcome—when a bank fails, there are investigations."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,I welcome—it’s 100 percent certainty that there will be independent investigations and outside investigations and all that.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"And one other question: Would you be open to an independent investigation, separate from the Fed’s probe?"
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,RACHEL SIEGEL.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"The, the banking system is, is strong, it is sound, it is resilient, it’s well capitalized, and I really don’t see that as at all analogous to this."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,I really don’t think it’s comparable to this.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, you know, we’re well aware of the concentrations people have in commercial real estate."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,Is there a risk that could mimic the kind of—what we saw with SVB to banks that disproportionately are focused in commercial real estate?
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,Rachel Siegel from the Washington Post.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Chair Powell."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,RACHEL SIEGEL.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,Let’s go to Rachel Siegel.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,No one should doubt that.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"In the meantime, you know—obviously, at the end of the day, we will do enough to bring inflation down to 2 percent."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we’re looking at, and we, we—it’s highly uncertain how long the situation will be sustained or how significant any of those effects would be, so we’re just going to have to watch."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"It doesn’t all have to come from rate hikes: It can come from, you know, from tighter credit conditions."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, the key is, we have to have—policy has got to be tight enough to bring inflation down to 2 percent over time."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"Yeah, I don’t know."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, in a way, that substitutes for rate hikes."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"I know we’ve talked a bit about how Silicon Valley Bank was unique to a certain sector of the economy, but there’s also growing concern that there are financial stability risks from the commercial real estate market and loans that will begin to roll over later this year and next, and that smaller regional banks also disproportionately hold those loans."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"So with the FDIC, we’re just, we’re lending to the, in effect, we’re—we’re lending to the bridge bank."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,Edward Lawrence from Fox Business.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,Really no magic to that.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"We needed to do a special facility that was designed a certain way, so we did it under 13(3)."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,We’ve done quite a lot under the discount window as well.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,So 13(3) seemed like the right—we have a little more flexibility under section 13(3).
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,Sure.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, second, can you discuss the Fed’s role in the—in the FDIC guarantee of uninsured depositors and why there’s $143 billion on your balance sheets last week, supporting that deposit guarantee?"
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"First, why is this new bank funding facility done under emergency 13(3) authority, as opposed to expansion of the discount window, changing the terms of the discount window that’s been around a long time?"
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,Two questions about aspects of the government’s response on Silicon Valley Bank two weekends ago.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,Neil Irwin with Axios.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Chair Powell."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,NEIL IRWIN.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"Inflation has been rather sticky, so do you need help from the fiscal side to get inflation down faster?"
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,Let’s go to Neil Irwin.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"It was—it was at the beginning perhaps part of what was driving inflation, but that’s not really the story now."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"You have to look at, at the impulse from spending because spending was, of course, tremendously high during the pandemic, and then, as the pandemic programs rolled off, spending actually came down, so the—this sort of fiscal impulse is actually not what’s driving inflation right now."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,So it’s prolonging inflation.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"And if I can follow on that, but they’re working—the spending that’s happened is working against what you are doing, right?"
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,EDWARD LAWRENCE.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,So—and we will get inflation down to 2 percent in time.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,And nothing’s going to change that.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,The Federal Reserve has responsibility for that.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,We have responsibility for price stability.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"We don’t give advice to the fiscal authorities, and we assume that—we take fiscal policy as, as it comes to our front door, stick it in our model along with a million other things."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,We don’t assume that.

2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"The longer it’s sustained, then the greater will be the likely declines in—or tightening in credit standards, credit availability, so we’ll just have to see."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,SIMON RABINOVITCH.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,Do you have specific thoughts on that?
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"What can we do to make sure that—but, again, that’s not for me to answer today."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"So that’s, I think that’s where—that’s what you think about."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,That is a great question and is right in the heart of what the review will be doing under Vice Chair Barr’s leadership.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, and getting to the seriousness of it, how are you going to ensure that banks comply with these citations, take them seriously—how will you enforce them?"
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,So.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"But those are serious—those are serious regulatory, in particular immediate attention, and that’s—and I guess there were six of them."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,I don’t know.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,How many?
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,Nancy Marshall-Genzer with Marketplace.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Chair Powell."

2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,Nancy.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think that pathway still exists and, you know, we’re certainly trying to find it."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"I do still think, though, that there’s a—there’s a pathway to that."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, the question will be how long this period is sustained."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s hard for me to see how they would have helped the possibility—but I guess I would just say, it’s too early to say whether there really have been changes in that."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know it’s, it’s too early to say, really, whether these events have had much of an effect."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"I just wanted to ask, with all the events of the past two weeks, do you still see a possibility of a soft landing for the U.S. economy?"
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,Just wondering: How many financial institutions have been issued matters requiring attention or matters requiring immediate attention citations at this point?
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,Jean Young with Market News.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"Well I, I—see, if I did, I wouldn’t share them because I, I really, you know, this review is going on, and, you know, I want nothing other than us to find out what happened and why, figure out what we can do to do better, and then implement those changes."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s—For me to be giving you my half-formed, or partially informed, thoughts, it, you know, just isn’t appropriate."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,And then we’re thinking about that as effectively doing the same thing that rate hikes do.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you very much.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mentioned with rate cuts, rate cuts are not in our base case, and, you know, so that’s all I have to say."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"And so, you know, we’ll be looking to see the first part of that—like how serious is this, and does it look like it’s going to be sustained, and if it is, you know, it could easily have a significant macroeconomic effect, and we would factor that into our policy decisions."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"And then—and then, you know, once you have—once you know that, there’s a fair amount of research about how that, with broad uncertainty bands—how that works its way into the economy [and] over what period of time."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"The question for us, though, is, how significant will that be and how, you know—what will be the extent of it and what will be the duration of it?"
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"So there are other measures which, if they’re focused on, you know—bank lending conditions and things like that—they show some more tightening."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we think that, though."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"So financial conditions seem to have tightened—and probably by more than the traditional indexes say, because traditional indexes are focused a lot on [interest] rates and [prices of] equities, and they don’t necessarily capture lending conditions."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"Curious how you view financial conditions now and, if credit were to tighten enough, if that would prompt a rate cut."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"Sorry, then the question before that was, just give me a— JENNIFER SCHONBERGER."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s all I want.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"As I mentioned, we’re always willing to change that if we conclude that it’s appropriate, but we’re really not seeing any signs there."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,And have the bank failures prompted any discussion around changing the implementation of the balance sheet runoff?
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,What situation would warrant a rate cut?
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"If credit becomes expensive enough, choking off growth, as you said you’re watching for, would that situation warrant a rate cut?"
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,Curious—how do you view financial conditions right now?
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,Jennifer Schonberger with Yahoo Finance.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you, Chair Powell."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,JENNIFER SCHONBERGER.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"Okay, we’ll go to Jennifer for the last question."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"There’s a real serious review going on with, with people from all over the Federal Reserve System who are not connected to this, you know, to this work, not connected to this bank, and under, again, Vice Chair Barr’s leadership, and I’m confident that it will produce a satisfactory result."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,So we haven’t really talked about changing the balance sheet implementation—that’s not something we’ve discussed yet.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Chair Powell."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,JEAN YUNG.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,Jean.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,Sure.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,Aren’t— didn’t you breathe a sigh of relief when that merger happened?
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mean, wasn’t that the big gorilla in the room?"
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,So I was wondering if you could go to the Credit Suisse merger.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,You said during the first week of the Silicon Valley weekend—you said the question you guys asked was “How did this happen?” when you saw Silicon Valley Bank.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,You gave just a little bit of color.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,I was wondering if you could give us a little bit more color.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,Greg Robb from MarketWatch.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you, Chair Powell."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,GREG ROBB.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, you know, we—that was really the Swiss government that we of course were, were following it over the course of the weekend, and we were engaged with their authorities in the way that you would expect, all the ways that you would expect."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,Let’s go to Greg Robb.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,And I think depositors should assume that their—that their deposits are safe.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"So—but what I’m saying is you’ve seen that we have the tools to protect depositors when there’s a threat of serious harm to the economy or to—or to the financial system, and we’re prepared to use those tools."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"Well, I’m not saying anything more than I’m saying."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"and, just by way of example, if a bank with less than $1 billion in assets failed, are you promising to bail out all of its depositors?"
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,Shouldn’t Congress have a say in that?
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,Are you saying that de facto deposit insurance covers all savings?
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"Chair Powell, you stated twice today that all depositors’ savings in the banking system are safe."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you very much.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,Simon Rabinovitch with the Economist.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,Hi.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"It seems to have been a positive outcome in the sense that the transaction was agreed to, and it has been— the markets have accepted it, and it seems to have gone well, and I think there was a concern that it might not go well."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"So coming into the middle of this week, yes, I would say that that is going well so far."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s just a place that we should try to get back to.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"You see late in an expansion—you see low unemployment, you see the benefits of wages going to people at the lower end of the wage spectrum."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"You can have very, very long expansions without high inflation, and we had several of those, and they’re very good for people."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"And the reason was inflation wasn’t forcing the central bank to come in and stop an incipient or, or, you know, an expansion."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"Four of the five longest, or three of the four longest expansions in U.S. history have been really since the high-inflation period."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"That’s how we can have a long—you know, we’ve had very strong labor markets through these long expansions that we’ve had."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"We don’t know—if so, we don’t know how significant it will be, and so, you know, we’re very focused on getting inflation down because we know in the longer run that that is the thing that will most benefit the people we serve."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"But when a recession happens, the reactions tend to be nonlinear and that’s what—so we don’t know whether that’ll happen this time."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, the models all work in a kind of linear way—if you have more of this, you get more of that."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"Well, it depends on whether you—so recessions tend to be nonlinear, and so they’re very hard to model."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"But I guess the question is, historically, it’s hard to— historically, it’s been hard to contain unemployment and I, I—the question is, do you worry about some sort of snowball effect, and how do you factor that into your projections and your thoughts?"
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,NICOLE GOODKIND.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we’re looking to avoid that and, you know, to get back to where we need to be—back to where we were for a quarter century, and get there as quickly as we can."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"And if you read your history, as I’m sure you have, you can see that if the central bank doesn’t get inflation back in place, get inflation—make sure that inflation expectations remain anchored, you can have a long series of years where inflation is high and volatile, and it’s hard to invest capital, it’s hard for an economy to perform well."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"The costs of bringing it down—there are real costs to bringing it down to 2 percent, but the costs of failing are much higher."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, I mean, I was really—we have to bring inflation down to 2 percent."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,So that’s just—that’s an estimate of what will happen as demand slows and as conditions soften in the labor market and it’s just—it’s a highly uncertain estimate.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,I’m wondering how you anticipate preventing this from snowballing while using the admittedly blunt tools at your disposal.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"In the Summary of Economic Projections, the FOMC sees the unemployment rate increasing to 4.5 percent this year."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,Nicole Goodkind with CNN Business.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you, Chair Powell."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,Hi.

2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,Nicole.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,Simon.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"Remember, we’re looking—for purposes of our monetary policy tool, we’re looking at what’s happening among the banks and asking, is there going to be some tightening in credit conditions?"
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you for taking our questions.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"So our decision was to move ahead with the 25 basis point hike and to change our guidance, as I mentioned, from ongoing hikes to some, some additional hikes maybe—some policy firming may be appropriate."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"In principle, as a matter of fact, you can think of it as being the equivalent of a rate hike or perhaps more than that; of course, it’s not possible to make that assessment today with any precision whatsoever."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,Such a tightening in financial conditions would work in the same direction as rate tightening.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we also assess, as I mentioned, that the events of the last two weeks are likely to result in some tightening credit conditions for households and businesses and thereby weigh on demand, on the labor market, and on inflation."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,It is important that we sustain that confidence with our actions as well as our words.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"We are committed to restoring price stability, and all of the evidence says that the public has confidence that we will do so—that we’ll bring inflation down to 2 percent over time."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"In fact, as of a couple of weeks ago, it looked like we’d need to raise rates over the course of the year more than we had expected at the time of the SEP in December—at the time of the December meeting."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, really, it is that the intermeeting data on inflation and the labor market came in stronger than expected and, really, before the recent events, we were clearly on track to continue with ongoing rate hikes."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"First, it was supported by a very strong consensus, and I’ll be happy to explain why."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we considered—we did consider that in the days running up to the meeting, and you see the decision that we made, which I’ll say a couple things about."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"Okay, just a quick follow-up: I mean, given all the stress and the uncertainty that you’ve also alluded to in the statement, how seriously was a—was a pause considered for this meeting?"
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"So going forward, as I mentioned, in assessing the need for, for further hikes, we’ll be focused as always on the incoming data and the evolving outlook and, in particular, on our assessment of the actual and expected effects of credit tightening."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,COLBY SMITH.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,Deposit flows in the banking system have stabilized over the last week.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"We took powerful actions with [the] Treasury and the FDIC, which demonstrate that all depositors’ savings are safe and that the banking system is safe."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I, I guess our view is that the banking system is sound and it’s resilient—it’s got strong capital [and] liquidity."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"How confident is the Committee that the recent stress that we’ve seen, and you’ve alluded to, is contained at this point and that deposit flight among midsize lenders in particular has ceased?"
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,Colby Smith with the Financial Times.

2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,I look forward to your questions.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,And the last thing I’ll say is that we’ve undertaken—we’re undertaking a thorough internal review that will identify where we can strengthen supervision and regulation.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.

2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I realize there’s a lot of uncertainty, but can you—can you explain at all to what extent your forecasts or those of your colleagues or those of the Board staff incorporated today a material tightening of credit availability because of the stress in the banking sector, or are you waiting to see it in the data before you incorporate that potential tightening into your forecasts?"
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"Obviously, that was before the stress in the banking sector."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"Chair Powell, in your testimony two weeks ago, you had indicated you thought the terminal rate would be higher."

2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think when we think about the situation with the banks, we’re focused on our—on our financial stability tools, in particular our lending facilities, the debt—sorry, the discount window, and also the new facility."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"In particular, we’re focused on, on this potential credit tightening and what can that produce in the way of tighter credit conditions."

2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,No.

2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,STEVE LIESMAN.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,So.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,We simply don’t know.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s also possible that this potential tightening will contribute significant tightening in credit conditions over time and, in principle, if that—that means that monetary policy may have less work to do."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mean, it, it’s possible that this will turn out to have very modest effects—that these events will turn out to be very, very modest effects on the economy, in which case inflation will continue to be strong—in which case, you know, the path will look— might look different."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we, we clearly were—what we were doing there was taking onboard the—trying to reflect the uncertainty about what will happen."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"Really, I would focus on, on the words “may” and “some,” as opposed to “ongoing.” Ongoing."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"No, I think it’s, it’s meant to refer to our policy rate."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"Does firming imply a rate increase per se, or could policy firm without you increasing rates?"
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"Mr. Chairman, can you explain the difference between ongoing rate increases and firming?"
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum-employment and price-stability goals.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,Everything we do is in service to our public mission.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"To conclude, we understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,Yet the labor market remains extremely tight.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,And nearly all participants see the risks to GDP growth as weighted to the downside.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"As shown in our Summary of Economic Projections, the median projection for real GDP growth stands at just 0.4 percent this year and 1.2 percent next year, well below the median estimate of the longer-run normal growth rate."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,Committee participants generally expect subdued growth to continue.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,Higher interest rates and slower output growth also appear to be weighing on business fixed investment.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"In contrast, activity in the housing sector remains weak, largely reflecting higher mortgage rates."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"Consumer spending appears to have picked up this quarter, although some of that strength may reflect the effects of swings in the weather across the turn of the year."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"The U.S. economy slowed significantly last year, with real GDP rising at a below-trend pace of 0.9 percent."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"In particular, without price stability, we will not achieve a sustained period of long—of strong labor market conditions that benefit all."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"Without price stability, the economy does not work for anyone."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,Price stability is the responsibility of the Federal Reserve.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"My colleagues and I understand the hardship that high inflation is causing, and we remain strongly committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"Job gains have picked up in recent months, with employment rising by an average of 351,000 jobs per month over the last three months."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"Turning to the broader economy and monetary policy: Inflation remains too high, and the labor market continues to be very tight."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,We will continue to closely monitor conditions in the banking system and are prepared to use all of our tools as needed to keep it safe and sound.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"Our banking system is sound and resilient, with strong capital and liquidity."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"This program, along with our long-standing discount window, is effectively meeting the unusual funding needs that some banks have faced and makes clear that ample liquidity in the system is available."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"With the support of the Treasury, the Federal Reserve Board created the Bank Term Funding Program to ensure that banks that hold safe and liquid assets can, if needed, borrow reserves against those assets at par."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,These actions demonstrate that all depositors’ savings and the banking system are safe.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"That is why, in response to these events, the Federal Reserve, working with the Treasury Department and the FDIC, took decisive actions to protect the U.S. economy and to strengthen public confidence in our banking system."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"History has shown that isolated banking problems, if left unaddressed, can undermine confidence in healthy banks and threaten the ability of the banking system as a whole to play its vital role in supporting the savings and credit needs of households and businesses."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"In the past two weeks, serious difficulties at a small number of banks have emerged."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"Before discussing today’s meeting, let me briefly address recent developments in the banking sector."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,Good afternoon.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"Transcript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference March 22, 2023 CHAIR POWELL."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s going to depend.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"In addition, we are committed to learning the lessons from this episode and to work to prevent episodes—events like this from happening again."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,The unemployment rate remained low in February at 3.6 percent.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"The labor force participation rate has edged up in recent months, and wage growth has shown some signs of easing."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"However, with job vacancies still very high, labor demand substantially exceeds the supply of available workers."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,Restoring price stability is essential to set the stage for achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the longer run.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,Reducing inflation is likely to require a period of below-trend growth and some softening in labor market conditions.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,We remain committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal and to keep longer-term inflation expectations well anchored.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"We will continue to make our meeting— decisions meeting by meeting, based on the totality of the vincoming data and their implications for the outlook for economic activity and inflation."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"These projections are not a Committee decision or plan; if the economy does not evolve as projected, the path for policy will adjust as appropriate to foster our maximum-employment and price-stability goals."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"These are little changed from our December projections, reflecting offsetting factors."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"If the economy evolves as projected, the median participant projects that the appropriate level of the federal funds rate will be 5.1 percent at the end of this year, 4.3 percent at the end of 2024, and 3.1 percent at the end of 2025."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"In our SEP, each FOMC participant wrote down an appropriate path for the federal funds rate based on what that participant judges to be the most likely scenario going forward."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"We will closely monitor incoming data and carefully assess the actual and expected effects of tighter credit conditions on economic activity, the labor market, and inflation, and our policy decisions will reflect that assessment."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"As a result, we no longer state that we anticipate that ongoing rate increases will be appropriate to quell inflation; instead, we now anticipate that some additional policy firming may be appropriate."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,It is too soon to determine the extent of these effects and therefore too soon to tell how monetary policy should respond.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"Since our previous FOMC meeting, economic indicators have generally come in stronger than expected, demonstrating greater momentum in economic activity and inflation."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,And we are continuing the process of significantly reducing our securities holdings.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"At today’s meeting, the Committee raised the target range for the federal funds rate by ¼ percentage point, bringing the target range to 4¾ to 5 percent."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"We are highly attentive to the risks that high inflation poses to both sides of our mandate, and we are strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent objective."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"My colleagues and I are acutely aware that high inflation imposes significant hardship, as it erodes purchasing power, especially for those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,The Fed’s monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"Despite elevated inflation, longer-term inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters, as well as measures from financial markets."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,The process of getting inflation back down to 2 percent has a long way to go and is likely to be bumpy.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"The median projection in the SEP for total PCE inflation is 3.3 percent for this year, 2.5 percent next year, and 2.1 percent in 2025."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"Inflation has moderated somewhat since the middle of last year, but the strength of these recent readings indicates that inflation pressures continue to run high."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"In February, the 12-month change in the CPI came in at 6 percent, and the change in the core CPI was 5.5 percent."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"Core PCE—excluding those, core PCE prices rose 4.7 percent."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"Over the 12 months ending in January, total PCE prices rose 5.4 percent; excluding the volatile food and energy categories."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,Inflation remains well above our longer-run goal of 2 percent.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,The median unemployment rate projection in the SEP rises to 4.5 percent at the end of this year and 4.6 percent at the end of next year.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"FOMC participants expect supply and demand conditions in the labor market to come into better balance over time, easing upward pressures on wages and prices."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"What I heard was significant number of people saying that they anticipated there would be some, some tightening of credit conditions and that would really have the same effects as, as our policies do, and that therefore they were including that in their assessment and that if that did turn out not to be the case, in principle you would need more rate hikes."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,So some people did reflect that in their FOMC—in their SEP forecasts.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"We believe, however, that events in the banking system over the past two weeks are likely to result in tighter credit conditions for households and businesses, which would in turn affect economic outcomes."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, we’re trying to assess something that just is so recent and it’s people—you know, it’s very difficult, there’s so much uncertainty."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, I simply can’t do that."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,It would be inappropriate for me at this stage to offer my views on what the answers might be.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"And then make an assessment of what are the right policies to put in place so that it doesn’t happen again, and then implement those policies."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,We will find that.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,Try to find that.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,What went wrong?
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,How did this happen is the question.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,My only interest is that we identify what went wrong here.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"So as for us—so for our part, we’re doing a review of supervision and regulation."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"So this is a—this is a very large group of connected depositors—concentrated group of connected depositors in a very, very fast run, faster than historical record would suggest."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,We know that SVB experienced an unprecedentedly rapid and massive bank run.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,We know that the public saw all this.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"Vice Chair Barr is leading this, and I think he’s testifying next week."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"We now know that supervisors saw these risks and, and intervened."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"So let me say what, what I think happened, and then I’ll come to the questions around supervision."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I wonder, you know, how can the American people have confidence that there aren’t other weaknesses out there in the banking system, given that this one got missed, as you noted?"
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"I wonder if you could talk a little bit—I know that you’ve got your internal review coming, but I wonder if you could talk a little bit about what you think happened with oversight at Silicon Valley Bank and whether this suggests that something about regulation and supervision needs to actually change going forward."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you for taking our questions.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,Jeanna Smialek from the New York Times.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Chair Powell."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,JEANNA SMIALEK.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,Jeanna.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"As we think about further rate hikes for us, we’ll be paying attention to the actual and expected effects from that."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"But we think it’s, it’s potentially quite real and that argues for, you know, being alert as we go forward."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, at a basic level, Silicon Valley Bank management failed badly—they grew the bank very quickly, they exposed the bank to significant liquidity risk and interest rate risk, didn’t hedge that risk."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we don’t really see it yet, so, so people are making estimates, you know, people are publishing estimates, but it’s very kind of rule-of-thumb guesswork almost at this point."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,So—but that will be up to him.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, the, the review is going to be thorough and transparent."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"In other words, what should people think about in terms of how the Fed thinks about how far it is from the terminal?"
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think there may also just have been— remember, this is 12 days ago."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,Or is it leavened by the idea of you don’t know what's going to happen?
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"Well, if I could follow up and ask, as you look forward into the rest of the year here, are you saying that what you see and the 5.1 percent basically consensus is based on being—it will be sufficiently restrictive?"
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHAEL MCKEE.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,But that’s not our baseline expectation.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"I would just say: As always, the path of the economy is uncertain, and policy is going to reflect what actually happens rather than what we write down in the SEP."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,They just don’t.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"In that most likely case, if that happens, participants don’t see rate cuts this year."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we published an SEP today, as you will have seen, and it shows that basically participants expect relatively slow growth, a gradual rebalancing of supply and demand in the labor market, with inflation moving down gradually."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"Are they getting this totally wrong from the Fed, or is there something different about the way you’re looking at it, given that you’re now thinking that moves might be appropriate as opposed to ongoing?"
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,So that’s really where it is.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"Following today’s decision, the markets have now priced in one more increase in May, and then every meeting the rest of this year they’re pricing in rate cuts."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,Michael McKee from Bloomberg Radio and Television.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHAEL MCKEE.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,Let’s go to Michael McKee.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"And so that’s really the nature of the interview—sorry, of the review—is to discover that."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"And again, supervisors did get in there, and, and they were, as you know, obviously, you know they were— they were on this issue, but nonetheless, this, this still happened."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"This was—this was a bank that was an outlier in terms of both its percentage of, of uninsured deposits and in terms of its holdings of duration risk."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,These are not weaknesses that are—that are at all broadly through the banking system.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,JEANNA SMIALEK.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I, I assume that there will be recommendations coming out of the report, and I, I plan on supporting them and supporting their implementation."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,It is clear—really to your last question—it’s clear that we do need to strengthen supervision and regulation.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,You’ve been very consistent in saying that the Fed would be raising interest rates and then holding them there for quite some time.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"That’s, that’s the issue."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"And the final point—you know, can we feel confident that these weaknesses don’t exist elsewhere, given that they got missed at this bank?"
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,Very large body of literature.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mean, the question we’re all asking ourselves over that first weekend was, how did this happen?"
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"We—I realized, you know, right away that, that there was going to be a need for review."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,And he’s responsible for it in his capacity as Vice Chair for Supervision.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"So Vice Chair Barr is, is of course leading that review."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"Okay, and then can you also—just to follow up, can you speak to the role that you will be playing in the Fed’s internal investigation on its supervision and regulation?"
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,VICTORIA GUIDA.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,That was the issue.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"The issue was really not about those specific banks, but about the risk of a contagion to, to other banks and to the financial markets more broadly."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"Was it purely a confidence issue, or was there a concern that there would be some sort of economic contagion or financial contagion from the failure of these banks?"
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,I was just wondering if you could speak to why that decision was made.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"I wanted to ask—you, along with the FDIC and the Treasury—the Fed Board decided to invoke the systemic risk exception to allow uninsured depositors to be protected at these two banks."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"And so what we did was, early Monday morning, we sat down and said, “Let’s do this.” And he, he was obviously going to lead it in his capacity."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,Victoria Guida with Politico.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,Hi.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,VICTORIA GUIDA.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,Victoria.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, we know that we have other, other tools in effect, but no, we think our monetary policy tool works, and we think, you know, many, many banks—our rate hikes were well telegraphed to the market, and many banks have managed to handle them."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"Have you, for example, considered changing reserve requirements, selling assets out of the System Open Market Account, as a way to better achieve tighter financial conditions that don’t accelerate deposit erosion, for example, from banks?"
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"To follow up: Have you considered at all whether your primary tool, the funds rate, is going to be enough to sustain the kind of tighter financial conditions that you believe will be necessary without doing significant damage to the banking sector?"
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,NICK TIMIRAOS.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"And then this, this latter part kind of—the possibility of credit conditions tightening really, really offset that, effectively."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,So that pointed to higher rates.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"The question is, how significant will this credit tightening be and how sustainable it will be?"
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"So December was a good place to start, and we wound up with—we wound up with very similar outcomes for December."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I don’t—my role was to announce it, and I get briefed on it, but I’m not involved in, in the work of it."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,Howard.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"There’s a great deal of literature on the connection between tighter credit conditions, economic activity, hiring, and inflation."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,So it’s really just a question of not knowing at this point.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"And are you not seeing more coming from that because you don’t know, or because you just don’t want to have another round of wishful thinking?"
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"If I could follow up on that, I was curious why you don’t see more coming from the credit crunch, because it seems to me that’s something that you’d actually welcome to a degree and expect."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,HOWARD SCHNEIDER.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"I will say that the inflation data that we got, to your point, really pointed to stronger inflation."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"And that’s, that’s of course 56 percent of the index."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,We don’t see that yet.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"And that is, you know, that’s just something that will have to come through softening demand and perhaps some softening in labor market conditions."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"Where we didn’t have in February, and we still don’t have now, is a sign of progress in the nonhousing services sector."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"So that’s 44 percent of the—of the core PCE index, where you’ve got a story that’s ongoing."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,We continue to see the new leases being signed at much lower levels of inflation.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,So the story is pretty much the same.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"Goods inflation has been coming down now for six months; it’s proceeding more slowly than we would have liked, but it’s certainly proceeding."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,HOWARD SCHNEIDER.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"Housing services is, is really a matter of time passing."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Chair Powell."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,Howard Schneider from Reuters.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,So I want to go back to your February press conference.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"You mentioned the word “disinflation,” I believe, 9 or 10 times, a process that you felt was—I forget the word you used—but gratefully under way, or something like that."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, in a way, the early—the data in the first part—the first five weeks of the intermeeting period pointed to stronger inflation and stronger labor markets."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,Is disinflation still occurring in the U.S. today?
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,Yes.
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mean, what actually happened, Howard, was I got the question 12 times, so it’s—maybe it’s a feature, not a bug."
2023-03-22,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, so, but yeah, absolutely the same—the story is intact, so it’s really three parts, right?"
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Oh, yes."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHAEL MCKEE.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Michael McKee for Bloomberg Radio and Television.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Can you tell us something about what your policy reaction function is—your policy framework is going forward?
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"When you look at the economy at the next meeting, are you looking at incoming data, which is, by definition, backward looking?"
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Are you going to be forecasting what you think is going to happen?
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Are you ruling out the rate cuts that the market has priced in?
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,I didn’t catch the last part.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Michael.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Rolling?
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHAEL MCKEE.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Markets have priced in rate cuts by the end of the year.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Sorry, sorry, sorry."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Do you rule that out?
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Great.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s—that would be the dynamic I would expect.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, you know, I’ve never said that, you know, that—that wages are really the principal driver, because I don’t think that’s really right."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,CHRIS RUGABER.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Okay, I got it."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Chris Rugaber at Associated Press.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Well, you mentioned profit margins."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Those have expanded—did expand sharply during this inflationary period.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"And while there are some signs that they are starting to decline, many economists note they haven’t fallen as much as might be expected, given that we’re seeing at least some pullback among consumer spending."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, speaking of causes of inflation, do you see expanded profit margins as a driver of higher prices?"
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"So higher profits and higher margins are what happens when you have an imbalance between supply and demand: too much demand, not enough supply."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we’ve been in a situation in many parts of the economy where, where supply has been fixed or, or not flexible enough."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"And so, you know, the way the market clears is through higher prices."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"So to get, I, I think—as goods pipelines have, have gotten, you know, back to normal so that we don’t have the long waits and the shortages and that kind of thing—I think you will see inflation come down."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"And you’ll see—you’ll see corporate margins coming down as a result of return of full competition, where there’s enough supply to meet demand."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"And then it’s—then it’s, then you’re really back to full competition."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"And if so, would you expect them to narrow soon and, and contribute to reduced inflation in the coming months?"
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, what are we looking at?"
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, of course, the history of the last two years has been very much that inflation moves down."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Of course, the whole idea is to—is to create a good forecast based on what you see in the data."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Yeah.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we on the Committee have a—have a view that inflation is going to come down—not so quickly, but it’ll take some time."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"And in that world, if that forecast is broadly right, it would not be appropriate and—to cut rates, and we won’t cut rates."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"If you have a different forecast and, you know, markets—or have been, from time to time, pricing in, you know, quite rapid reductions in inflation, you know, we’d, we’d factor that in."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,But that’s not our forecast.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Particularly now, if you look at nonhousing services, it really, really hasn’t moved much."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,And it’s quite stable.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, so we think we’ll have to—demand will have to weaken a little bit, and labor market conditions, conditions may have to soften a bit more to begin to see progress there."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, again, in that world, it wouldn’t be—it wouldn’t be appropriate for us to cut rates."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Courtenay.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,COURTENAY BROWN.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Courtenay Brown from Axios.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,And it’s very hard to say what’s causing what.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,I’m curious how you view the role of the overnight reverse repo facility in the context of the current banking stress.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mean, we look at a combination of data and, and forecasts."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,What about the idea of rate cuts?
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, you know, we, we will make our best assessment, and that’s what we think."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we’re always, always looking at both."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, and it will—of course, it’ll be the obvious things."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,It’ll be readings on inflation.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’ll be readings on wages, on economic growth, on the labor market, and all of those many things."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think a particular focus for us going—now, over the past six, seven weeks now and going forward is going to be, what’s happening with credit tightening?"
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Are small and medium-sized banks tightening credit standards, and, and is that having an effect on, on loans, on lending?"
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, so we can begin to assess how that fits in with monetary policy."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"That’ll, that’ll be an important thing."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"I just—you know, we’ll be looking at everything."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s— again, I would just point out, we’ve raised rates by 5 percentage points."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,We are shrinking the balance sheet.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"And now we have credit conditions tightening—not just in the normal way, but perhaps a little bit more, due to what’s happened."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we have to factor all of that in and, and make our assessment of—you know, of whether our policy stance is sufficiently restrictive."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,And we have to do that in a world where policy works with long and variable lags.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,So this is challenging.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHAEL MCKEE.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,I think wages and prices tend to move together.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, it’s, it’s a couple of percentage points above what would be—what would be consistent with 2 percent inflation over time."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,You’re asking me a very specific question.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"But the labor market is very, very strong, whereas inflation is, you know, running high—well above our—well above our goal."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"And right now, we need to be focusing on bringing inflation down."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Fortunately, we’ve been able to do that so far without unemployment going up."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Matt.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,MATTHEW BOESLER.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Chair Powell."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Matthew Boesler with Bloomberg News.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, many analysts noted at the time of the March FOMC meeting that at least half of Fed officials’ projections did imply or seemed to imply that a recession was in their baseline forecast as well, given the strong first-quarter GDP tracking estimates."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"And so I’m just wondering if you could kind of elaborate on, you know, why you’re optimistic that a recession can be avoided, given that that’s the Fed staff’s forecast—possibly also the broader Committee’s forecast as well—and, and also, of course, most private-sector forecasters’."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Yeah.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"I don’t think—you know, I know what’s printed in the Summary of Economic Projections and all that."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"I don’t think you can deduce exactly what you said about what participants think, because you don’t know what they were thinking for first- quarter GDP at that point."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,They could have been thinking about a fairly low number.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,These are very positive developments.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Anyway, in any case, I’ll just say, I, I continue to think that it’s possible that this time is really different."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,So we do see some softening; we see new labor supply coming in.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, overall, you’re near a 50-year low in unemployment."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Do you think it’s contributing to the stress by making it more attractive for money market funds to compete with banks for deposits?
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,We’re looking for inflation going down to 2 percent over time.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mean, we—that’s, that’s not a question that’s in front of us, and it would depend on so many other things."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, ultimately, we’re not looking to get to 3 percent and then drop our tools."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"We have a, a goal of getting to 2 percent."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,We think it’s going to take some time.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,We don’t think it’ll be a smooth process.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, I think we’re going to—we’re going to need to stay at this for a while."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,EDWARD LAWRENCE.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"How does the other side of the mandate—the jobs side—once you get to 3 percent, going from 3 to 2, how does the other side of the mandate balance?"
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think they, they—you know, they, they will both matter equally at that point."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Right now, you have a labor market that’s still extraordinarily tight."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"You still got 1.6 job openings, even with the lower job openings number, for every unemployed person."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,We do see some evidence of softening in labor market conditions.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Wages—you all will have seen that the wage number from late last week, and it’s—whenever it was."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,I think there are many things.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"And the reason is, there’s just so much excess demand, really, in the labor market."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"So job openings are still very, very high."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Sure.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we look at a range of wage, wage measures."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,And then that’s in nominal.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,And then—so you assume wages should be equal to productivity increases plus inflation.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"And so you can—you can look at, you know, the employment compensation index, average hourly earnings, the Atlanta wage tracker, compensation per hour—basically, those four and many others."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"And you can—you can look at, at what the—what they would have to run at over a long period of time for that to be consistent with 2 percent inflation."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,They can deviate.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, corporate margins can go up and down."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"And there is a feature of long expansions where they do go down—where labor gets a bigger share toward later, later in a recession—sorry, later in an expansion."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, yeah."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"The, the—you know, and we calculate those, and you have to take the precision with a degree of—a degree of salt."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"But I would say that what they will show is that, you know, if, if the—if wages are running at 5 percent, 3 percent is closer to where they need to be."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Wage increases and closer to 3 percent, roughly, is what it would take to get—to be consistent with inflation over a longer period of time."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"I—by the way, I don’t want to—I do not think that wages are the principal driver of inflation."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"And could you kind of explain, you know, how you come to that judgment?"
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s, it’s interesting, as, you know, we’ve raised rates by 5 percentage points in 14 months, and the unemployment rate is 3½ percent, pretty much where it was—even lower than where it was when we started."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Do you see that as well?
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,MATTHEW BOESLER.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"We see—by surveys and much, much [other] evidence—that, that conditions are cooling gradually."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,But it’s—it really is different.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, it wasn’t supposed to be possible for job openings to decline by as much of the—as they’ve declined without unemployment going up."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Well, that’s what we’ve seen."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,So we—there are no promises in this.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"But it just seems that, to me, that it’s possible that we can continue to have a cooling in the labor market without having the big increases in unemployment that have gone with many, you know, prior episodes."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Now, that would be against history."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"I, I fully appreciate that."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"That would be against the, the pattern."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"But I do think that it—that this, that the situation in the labor market, with so much excess demand, yet, you know, wages are actually—wages have been moving down."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Wage increases have been moving down, and that’s a good sign—down to a more sustainable level."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,So I think that—I think it’s still possible.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"I—you know, I think, you know, the, the case of, of avoiding a recession is, in my view, more likely than that of having, having a recession."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"But it’s not—it’s not that the case of having a recession is—I don’t rule that out, either."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s, it’s possible that we will have what I hope would be a mild recession."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,The Committee also noted in March that wage growth was still well above levels that would be consistent with 2 percent inflation.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,And did the Committee discuss any changes to the structure of the facility?
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, and we’re going to be looking at those factors that we listed and—to determine whether there’s, there’s more to do."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,GREG ROBB.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Just wondered if you have any regrets?
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Or was there anything that, you know—decisions that maybe you regret now in light of what’s happened?"
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"I’ve had a few, sure."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mean, you know, who doesn’t look back and think that you could have done things differently?"
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, honestly, you don’t—you don’t get to do that."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Again, my focus is on what—control the controllable."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"As one of my great mentors used to always say, “Control the controllable.” What we control now is, make a fair assessment, learn the right lessons, figure out what the fixes are, and implement them."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, and I think that, that Vice Chair Barr’s report is an excellent first step in that, but we’ve got to follow through."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,MEGAN CASSELLA.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, there."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Megan Cassella with Barron’s.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Did the possibility of pausing at this meeting come up at all, and how seriously was that considered?"
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,I’m curious if you can give us any color as to whether there were any initial concerns about raising rates again or what those discussions entailed.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, ultimately, that person does get to set the agenda and gets to take things to the Board of Governors and really, in supervision, has sole authority over supervision."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, that’s, that’s my input."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know—but, but it isn’t—I wouldn’t say it’s a matter of complete deference."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"The Vice Chair, it says, shall deploy policy recommendations—“develop policy recommendations for the Board regarding supervision and regulation of depository institution ."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,companies .
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,", and shall oversee the supervision and regulation of such firms.” So this is Congress establishing a four-year term for someone else on the Board—not, not the Chair—as Vice Chair for Supervision who really gets to set the agenda for supervision and regulation for the Board of Governors."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Congress wanted that person to be—to have political accountability for developing that agenda.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"So the way it works—the way it has worked in practice for me is, I’ve had a good working relationship."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"I give my, my counsel, my input privately, and that’s—I offer that."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I have good conversations, and I try to contribute constructively."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"I respect the authority that Congress has deferred on that person, including working with, with Vice Chair Barr and, and his predecessor."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I think that’s the way it’s supposed to work, and that’s appropriate."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"I, I believe that’s what the law requires."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s more, I have a—I have a role in, in presenting my views and discussing—having an intelligent discussion about what’s going on and why."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, on, on the Vice Chair for Supervision, you know, the place to start is, is the statutory role, which is quite unusual."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,So support for the 25 basis point rate increase was very strong across the board.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,I don’t want to try to do the head count in real time.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"It—we know—now that we know it’s possible, I think we didn’t—no one thought that was possible."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,No one—I’m not aware of anybody thinking that this could happen so—quite so quickly.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I think that, you know, that will play through."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"I, I, you know—it will be up to Vice Chair Barr to really take the lead in designing the ways to address that."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,But I think—I think that’s one thing.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"I, I guess I would just say that."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Then, you know—that we’re going to— obviously, we’re going to revisit [this]."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s pretty clear we need—to me, anyways—clear that we need to strengthen both supervision and regulations for banks of this size."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I’m, I’m thinking that we’re on the—on track to do that as well."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Can you be any more specific on stress testing or looking at banks that have specific concentrations in certain parts of the economy?
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Yeah.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"That’s—see, that’s, that’s what Vice Chair Barr’s role really is, and he’ll take the lead on that."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, it’s—let me just say, that’s not what we’re looking for."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,And that now needs to be reflected in some—in some way in regulation and in supervision.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"I would say there are a number of people—and, you know, you’ll see this in the minutes."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Well, I just would start with something that’s changed, really, which is this—the run on Silicon Valley Bank was out of keeping with the speed of runs through history."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,What are those lessons?
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"But people did talk about pausing, but not so much at this meeting, you know, that we’re—I mean, there’s a sense that we’re, we’re—that, you know, we’re much closer to the end of this than to the beginning, that—you know, as I mentioned, if you—if you add up all the tightening that’s going on through various channels, it’s—we, we feel like we—you know, we’re getting close or, or maybe even there."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"But that, again, that’s going to be an ongoing assessment."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,MEGAN CASSELLA.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"I’m curious, too, how to interpret that and, and the changes to the statement."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Is the bar higher now to raise rates at the next meeting, or would a strong jobs report or inflation print be enough to push the Fed to tighten again?"
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,I don’t want to—I couldn’t—I couldn’t really say.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"I just think we’re—I think we—look, I think we’ve moved a long way fairly quickly."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I think we can afford to look at the data and, and make a careful assessment."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,And we’ll go to Nancy for the last question.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Chair Powell."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Nancy Marshall-Genzer with Marketplace.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,You mentioned a few times about the lessons you’ve learned from the banking crisis—that you would learn the right lessons.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,And I do feel that I’m personally accountable to do what I can to foster measures that will address the problems.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,And I agree with and will support those recommendations.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,I welcome it.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Yeah.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"I would just say, it’s —I, I don’t really think we should be— we shouldn’t even be talking about a world in which the U.S. doesn’t pay its bills."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,It just—it just shouldn’t be a thing.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, and again, I would just say, we don’t—no one should assume that the Fed can do—can really protect the economy and the financial system and our reputation globally from, from the damage that such, such an event might inflict."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Scott.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,SCOTT HORSLEY.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thanks, Mr. Chairman."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Scott Horsley for NPR.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"In his report last week, Vice Chair Barr identified a couple of the factors that he thought contributed to the regulatory—or the supervisory lapses at Silicon Valley Bank: a policy change in 2019 to exempt all but the biggest banks from strict scrutiny and also what he called a sort of cultural shift towards less aggressive oversight."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,You were here in 2019.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Do you share that view, and what would it take to get the, the stronger oversight that you and he said in your release would be necessary?"
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I, I didn’t—I didn’t take part in creating the report or doing the work, but I do—I have read it, of course."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,And I find it persuasive.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mean, I would say it this way: A, a very large—a large bank, not a very large bank—a large bank failed quite suddenly and unexpectedly in a way that threatened to spread contagion into the financial system."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"I know you talked about that in terms of fiscal policy, but can you just speak towards what the impact of a default would mean for Americans across the country, the markets, and borrowing?"
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Sarah Ewall-Wice, CBS News."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Sure.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we looked at that very carefully, as you would imagine."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, the—it’s, it’s really not contributing, we don’t think, now."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,It hasn’t actually been growing.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, it moved up—moved down and then moved back up to where it was."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"What happened in the—when, when there were the big deposit flows, which, by the way, have really stabilized now—what happened was, institutional investors took their uninsured deposits and put them in government money market funds, which bought paper from the Federal Home Loan Banks and things like that."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Over the course of, of maybe the last year, retail investors had been gradual—as they do in every tightening cycle, they’ve been gradually moving their deposits into higher-yielding places such as CDs and, and other things, including money market funds."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"So that’s a gradual process that is quite natural and happens during a, a tightening cycle."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"What was unusual, really, was the institutional investors moving their uninsured deposits and spreading them around and things like that."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,But it doesn’t seem to have had any—any effect overall on the overnight repo facility.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"That is really there to, to help us keep rates where they’re supposed to be, and it’s, it’s serving that purpose very well."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Sarah.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,SARAH EWALL-WICE.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,I want to go back to the debt ceiling for a moment.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think the only thing that, that I’m really focused on is to understand what went wrong, what happened, and, and identify what we need to do to address that."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Some of that is—may, it may just have been technology evolving."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, we have to keep up with all that."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Okay.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Greg.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,GREG ROBB.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you, Fed Chairman."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Greg Robb from MarketWatch.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"I just wondered if you’ve done any reflection on, on your own actions during this crisis and leading up to it over the last—since you’ve been Fed Chairman, I think I’ve heard you say a couple of times that you deferred to the Vice Chair for Supervision."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Do you think that was the right way to go about this?
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, yeah, comments on that."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Sure.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"So let me say, first of all, I’ve been Chair of the Board for five-plus years now, and I fully recognize that we made mistakes."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think we’ve learned some new things as well, and we need to do better."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, as I mentioned, I thought the report was unflinching and appropriately so."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"More broadly, we, we will continue to very carefully monitor what’s going on in the banking system, and we’ll factor that assessment into our decisions in an important way, going forward."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,What’s going to be the macroeconomic effect of that?
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"I also think we are very focused on what’s happening with credit availability, particularly, you know, with what you saw in the—in the Beige Book, and you will see in the SLOOS, is, is small and medium—medium-sized, small and medium-sized banks who are feeling that they need to tighten credit standards—build liquidity."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Okay.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"But some of it may be our policies, and—supervisory and regulatory, whatever."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"What our job is now is, identify those things and implement them."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,And that’s kind of the only thing I care about is—and I think—I feel like I am accountable for doing everything I can to make sure that that happens.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Let’s go to Evan.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,EVAN RYSER.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Or do you see that being put on the table in the future?
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Evan Ryser with MNI Market News.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, secondly, do you still have a bias to tighten rates?"
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Is that what the statement is saying?
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,So I guess I would—I guess I would say it this way.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"There were three large banks, really, from the very beginning that were at the heart of the stress that we— that we saw in early March, the severe period of stress."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Those have now all been resolved, and all the depositors have been protected."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think that the resolution and sale of, of First Republic kind of draws a line under that period of—is an important step toward drawing a line under that period of, of severe stress."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Chair Powell, are we in the early stage or nearing the end stage of the banking turmoil among regional banks?"
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I also wonder if the Fed staff has in any way revised their forecast for a mild recession from the March minutes and, if so, what a recession like what they’re envisioning would look and feel like when it comes to, for example, the unemployment rate."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,EDWARD LAWRENCE.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,And what type of situation would that look like?
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I wouldn’t want to speculate specifically, but I will say this: These are fiscal policy matters, for starters, and they’re, they’re for Congress and the Administration—for the elected parts of the government to deal with."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,And they’re really consigned to them.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"From our standpoint, I would just say this: It’s essential that the debt ceiling be raised in a timely way, so that the U.S. government can pay all of its bills when they’re due."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,A failure to do that would be unprecedented.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’d be in uncharted territory, and the—and the consequences to the U.S. economy would be highly uncertain and could, could be quite a[d]verse."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,So I’ll just leave it there.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"We, we don’t give advice to either side."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,We just would point out that it—that it’s very important that this be done.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"And the, the other point I’ll make about that, though, is that no one should assume that the Fed can protect the economy from the potential, you know, short- and long-term effects of a failure to pay our bills on time."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"We, we— it’s, it would be so uncertain that it’s just as important that, that this—we never get to a place where we’re actually talking about or even having a situation where the U.S. government’s not paying its bills."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,RACHEL SIEGEL.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,And just a follow-up.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Was discussion around the uncertainty of a possible standoff—did that affect today’s monetary policy decision at all?
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"You’ve said repeatedly that the ceiling must be raised, but do you see any economics effects of even getting close to a default?"
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,I’m wondering if you can talk about the account of possible effects of a debt-limit standoff.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Rachel Siegel from the Washington Post.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"So the—the staff’s forecast is—so let me say—start by saying that that’s not my own most likely case, which is really that, that the economy will continue to grow at, at a modest rate this year."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,And I think that’s—so different people on the Committee have different forecasts.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"That’s, that’s my own assessment of the most likely path."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"[The] staff produces its own forecast, and it’s independent of the forecasts of, of the participants, which include the Governors and the Reserve Bank presidents, of course."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we think this is a healthy thing— that the, the staff is writing down what they really think."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"They’re not especially influenced by what the Governors think, and vice versa."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,The Governors are not taking what the staff says and just writing that down.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"So it’s actually good that the, the staff and individual participants can have different perspectives."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, broadly, the forecast was for a mild recession, and by that I would characterize as one in which the rise in unemployment is smaller than is—has been typical in modern-era recessions."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,I wouldn’t want to characterize the staff’s forecast for this meeting.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’ll, we’ll leave that to the minutes—but broadly, broadly similar to that."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Rachel.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,RACHEL SIEGEL.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you, Chair Powell."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks for taking our questions.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, we’ll approach that question at the June meeting."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,I wouldn’t say that it did.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"We talk a lot about risks to the—to the outlook, and that will—that come up."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"And it was about interest rate risk in the banks and, and lots of data."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"And there was one page on Silicon Valley Bank, which talked about, you know, the amount of losses they—or mark-to-market losses they had in their portfolio."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"There was nothing in it about—that I recall, anyway, about, about the risk of a bank run."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"So it was—I think the takeaway was, they were going away to do a—an assessment, a vertical—sorry, horizontal assessment of, of banks."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"It wasn’t—it, it wasn’t presented as an urgent or alarming situation."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"It was presented as a—as an informational, nondecisional kind of a thing."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I thought it was a good presentation and, and, as I said, did remember it."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"In terms of what we’re doing—of course, I think banks themselves are, are—many, many banks are now, are attending to liquidity and taking opportunity now, really, since, since the events of, of early March, to build liquidity."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,And you asked about the separation principle.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"I— you know, like so many things, it, it’s very useful."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, you know, ultimately, it has its limits."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mean, I, I think in this particular case, we have found that the monetary policy tools and the financial stability tools are not in conflict."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,They’re both—they’re working well together.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’ve used our, our financial stability tools to support banks through our lending facilities."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, at the same time, we’ve been able to use our monetary policy tools to foster maximum employment and price stability."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,I think all members were there.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"It was—of course, it’s something that came up."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,It was an informational briefing of the whole Board— the entire Board.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,I did remember it.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,A number of people did raise that as a risk to the outlook.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,I wouldn’t say that it was important in today’s monetary policy decision.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Steve.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,STEVE LIESMAN.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Mr. Chairman, can you—oh, thank you."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Steve Liesman, CNBC."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Can you tell us what the Federal Reserve Board did in the wake of that February presentation where you were informed that Silicon Valley Bank and other banks were experiencing interest rate risks?
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,And can you tell me what supervisory actions you’ve done in the wake of the recent bank failures to make sure that banks are currently appropriately managing interest rate risk?
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"And kind of part 3, but it’s all the same question here—do, do you still think this separation principle that monetary policy and supervision can be handled with different tools?"
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Sure.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,So the February 14 presentation—I didn’t remember it very well.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"But now, of course, I’ve gone back and looked at it very carefully."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,And what it was was a general presentation.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,STEVE LIESMAN.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,And so we’ll be driven by incoming data meeting by meeting.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"We took that out, and instead we’re saying that, in determining the extent to which additional policy firming may be appropriate to return inflation to 2 percent over time, the Committee will take into account certain factors."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"The pace of economic growth in the first quarter of this year continued to be modest, at 1.1 percent, despite a pickup in consumer spending."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Activity in the housing sector remains weak, largely reflecting higher mortgage, mortgage rates."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Higher interest rates and slower output growth also appear to be weighing on business fixed investment.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,The labor market remains very tight.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Over the first three months of the year, job gains averaged 345,000 jobs per month."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"The unemployment rate remained very low in March, at 3.5 percent."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Even so, there are some signs that supply and demand in the labor market are coming back into better balance."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"The labor force participation rate has moved up in recent months, particularly for individuals aged 25 to 54 years."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Nominal wage growth has sown— shown some signs of easing, and job vacancies have declined so far this year."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"But overall, labor demand still substantially exceeds the supply of available workers."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Inflation remains well above our longer-run goal of 2 percent.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Over the 12 months ending in March, total PCE prices rose 4.2 percent; excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 4.6 percent."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Inflation has moderated somewhat since the middle of last year.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Nonetheless, inflation pressures continue to run high, and the process of getting inflation back down to 2 percent has a long way to go."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Despite elevated inflation, longer-term inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters, as well as measures from financial markets."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"The U.S. economy slowed significantly last year, with real GDP rising at a below-trend pace of 0.9 percent."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"The Fed’s monetary policy actions are guided by, by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,I will have more to say about today’s monetary policy actions after briefly reviewing economic developments.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,We are also continuing to reduce our securities holdings.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Transcript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference May 3, 2023 CHAIR POWELL."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Good afternoon.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Before discussing today’s meeting, let me comment briefly on recent developments in the banking sector."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Conditions in that sector have broadly improved since early March, and the U.S banking system is sound and resilient."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,We will continue to monitor conditions in the sector.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,We are committed to learning the right lessons from this episode and will work to prevent events like these from happening again.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"As a first step in that process, last week we released Vice Chair for Supervision Barr’s Review of the Federal Reserve’s Supervision and Regulation of Silicon Valley Bank."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"The review’s findings underscore the need to address our rules and supervisory practices to make for a stronger and more resilient banking system, and I am confident that we will do so."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,You would be okay with a prolonged 3 percent?
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"My colleagues and I understand the hardship that high inflation is causing, and we remain strongly committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Price stability is the responsibility of the Federal Reserve.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Without price stability, the economy does not work for anyone."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"In particular, without price stability, we will not achieve a sustained period of strong labor market conditions that benefit all."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Today, the FOMC raised its policy interest rate by ¼ percentage point."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Since early last year, we have raised interest rates by a total of 5 percentage points in order to attain a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2 percent over time."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Looking ahead, we will take a data-dependent approach in determining the extent to which additional policy firming may be appropriate."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,So we—that’s a— that’s a meaningful change that we’re no longer saying that we anticipate.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"My colleagues and I are acutely aware that high inflation imposes significant hardship, as it erodes purchasing power, especially for those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"At today’s meeting, the Committee raised the target range for the federal funds rate by ¼ percentage point, bringing the target range to 5 to 5¼ percent."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,I look forward to your questions.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Jeanna.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,JEANNA SMIALEK.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Hi.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Jeanna Smialek, New York Times."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks for taking our questions.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,I wonder if you could tell us whether we should read the statement today as a suggestion that the Committee is prepared to pause interest rate increases in June.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, taking your question—of course, today our decision was to raise the federal funds rate by 25 basis points."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"A, a decision on a pause was not made today."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"You will have noticed that in the—in the statement from March, we had a sentence that said the Committee anticipates that some additional policy firming may be appropriate."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"That sentence is, is not in, in the statement anymore."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum-employment and price-stability goals.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"We are highly attentive to the risks that high inflation pose—poses to both sides of our mandate, and we are strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent objective."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Everything we do is in service to our public mission.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Restoring price stability is essential to set the stage for achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the longer run.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,And we’re continuing to [carry out] the process of significantly reducing our securities holdings.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"With today’s action, we have raised interest rates by 5 percentage points in a little more than a year."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"We are seeing the effects of our policy tightening on demand in the most interest rate–sensitive sectors of the economy, particularly housing and investment."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"It will take time, however, for the full effects of monetary restraint to be realized, especially on inflation."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"In addition, the economy is likely to face further headwinds from tighter credit conditions."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Credit conditions had already been tightening over the past year or so in response to our policy actions and a softer economic outlook.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,But the strains that emerged in the banking sector in early March appear to be resulting in even tighter credit conditions for households and businesses.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"In turn, these tighter credit conditions are likely to weigh on economic activity, hiring, and inflation."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,The extent of these effects remains uncertain.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"In light of these uncertain headwinds, along with the monetary policy restraint we have put in place, our future policy actions will depend on how events unfold."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"In determining the extent to which additional policy firming may be appropriate to return inflation to 2 percent over time, the Committee will take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial developments."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"We, we will make that determination meeting by meeting, based on the totality of incoming data and their implications for the outlook for economic activity and inflation."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,And we are prepared to do more if greater monetary policy restraint is warranted.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,We remain committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal and to keep longer-term inflation expectations well anchored.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Reducing inflation is likely to require a period of below-trend growth and some softening of labor market conditions.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"To conclude: We understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Mr. Chairman, I’m sorry."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"From the perspective of monetary policy, our focus remains squarely on our dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"It was already, I think, 40, 45 percent of banks were tightening credit as of the, the last survey."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"What did this one show, and how did that weigh into your deliberations?"
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we’re going to release the results of this SLOOS on May 8, in line with our usual time frame."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I would just say that the SLOOS is broadly consistent, when you see it, with how we and others have been thinking about the situation and what we’re seeing from other sources."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,You will have seen the Beige Book and listened to the various earnings calls that indicate that midsize banks have—some of them had been tightening their lending standards.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Banking data will show that lending has continued to grow, but the pace has been slowing really since the second half of last year."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Let’s go to Nick.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,NICK TIMIRAOS.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Nick Timiraos, Wall Street Journal."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Chair Powell, the argument around the end of last year and the beginning of this year to slow down the pace of increases was to give yourself time to study the effects of those moves."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"After the bank failures in March, as you’ve discussed, the Fed staff projected a recession starting later this year."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,So my question is why it was necessary to raise interest rates today.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Or, put, put differently: If the whole point of slowing down the pace was to see the effects of your moves, and now you’ve, for the last two meetings, been seeing the effects of those moves, why did the Committee feel it was necessary to keep moving?"
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Could you give us a sense of what the SLOOS survey indicated?
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,I have a follow-up on credit.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"And that’s—you know, we’re just going to have to— before we really declare that, I think we’re going to have to see data accumulating and, and, you know, make that—as I mentioned, it’s an ongoing assessment."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,We get—there’s a lot of data on that.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, we’ll, we’ll factor that into our decisionmaking."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Howard.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,HOWARD SCHNEIDER.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Howard Schneider with Reuters.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, noting that the statement dropped the reference to “sufficiently” restricted—“restrictive,” I was wondering, given your baseline outlook, whether you feel this current rate of 5 to 5¼ percent is, in fact, sufficiently restrictive."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s going to be an ongoing assessment.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’re going to need data to accumulate on that—not an assessment that we’ve made, as—that, that would mean we think we’ve reached that point."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I just think it’s, it’s not possible to say that with confidence now."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, nonetheless, you, you will know that the Summary of Economic Projections from the March meeting showed that in—at that point in time, that the median participant thought that this was— this was the appropriate level of the—of the ultimate high level of rates."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,We don’t know that.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,We’ll revisit that at the June meeting.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,HOWARD SCHNEIDER.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Nonetheless, we’ll be able to see what’s happening with credit conditions— what’s happening with lending."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Well, we—the reason is that we—again, with our monetary policy we’re try—trying to reach and then—and then stay at a, for an extended period, a level of policy—a policy stance that’s sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation down to 2 percent over time."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,I think slowing down was the right move.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,So you’ve got 2 percent real rates.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"That’s meaningfully above what most people would—many people, anyway, would, would assess as, you know, the neutral rate."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,So policy is tight.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,And you see that in interest— interest-sensitive activities.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"And you also begin to see it more and more in, in other activities."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"And if you—if you put the—you put the credit tightening on top of that and the QT that’s, that’s ongoing, I think, I think you feel like, you know, we’re, we may not be far off—we’re possibly even at—that level."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Edward.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,EDWARD LAWRENCE.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you very much, Chair Powell."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Edward Lawrence with Fox Business.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Look—I think we’re always going to have 2 percent as our, our target."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,We’re always going to be focusing on getting there.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"I don’t mean to be argumentative, but the, the staff report said, “SVB ."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"But one way is to look at the nominal rate and then subtract a, a reasonable estimate of, of, let’s say, one-year inflation, which might be 3 percent."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, that’s what we’re trying to do with our—with our tool."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,I think real rates are probably—that you can calculate them many different ways.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, we, we have the luxury: We’ve raised 500 basis points."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"I, I think it’s enabled us to see more data, and it will continue to do so."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I, I—you know, we really—you know, we have to balance."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"We always have to balance the risk of not doing enough and, and not getting inflation under control against the risk of maybe slowing down economic activity too much."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we thought that this rate hike, along with the meaningful change in, in our policy statement, was the right way to balance that."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,NICK TIMIRAOS.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"And just to follow up, you know, what you said in response to Howard’s question—you’ll need data to accumulate to determine if this is a sufficiently restrictive stance."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Does that data need to accumulate, or could it accumulate over a longer period than a six-week intermeeting cycle?"
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Yeah.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mean, as I mentioned, I would just say that this assessment will be an ongoing one."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"You—you know, you can’t—with, with economic data, you, you can’t—you’ve, you’ve seen—take inflation for a minute."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Look, look back."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,We’ve seen inflation come down—move back up two or three times since March of 2021.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,We’ve seen inflation have a few months of coming down and then come right back up.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I think you’re going to want to see that—you know, that a few months of data will, will persuade you that you’ve—that you’ve got this right, kind of thing."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,I think that policy is tight.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"But translating it into, into rate hikes is uncertain, let’s say—it adds even further uncertainty."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"So if the Federal Reserve gets down to the 3 percent inflation, as the projections show, at the end of this year or close to it, would it be okay for you for a prolonged period of 3 percent inflation and hoping for some outside event to move down to 2 percent target?"
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Credit tightening is a different thing.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I, you know, we certainly don’t—and I don’t have an agenda to further consolidate banks."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,There’s been—consolidation has been a factor in the U.S. banking industry really since interstate banking and before that even—it goes back more than 30 years.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"You—when I was in the government a while back, I think there were 14,000 banks."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Now there are 4,000 and change."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"So that’s, that’s going on."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"I personally have long felt that having small-, medium-, and large-size banks is a, a great part of our banking system."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, the community banks serve particular customers very well; regional banks serve very important purposes, and the various kinds of G-SIBs do as well."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I think it’s healthy to have a, you know, an arrange—a range of different kinds of banks doing different things."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,I think that’s a positive thing.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Is it a financial—so I would just say, in terms of J.P. Morgan buying First Republic, the FDIC really runs the process of closing and selling a closed bank completely."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"That, that is their role, so I really don’t have a comment on, on that process."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"As you know, there’s an exception to the deposit cap for a failing bank."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,So it was legitimate.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I think the FDIC, I believe, is bound by law to take the bid that is the least-cost bid."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,So I would assume that’s what they did.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,VICTORIA GUIDA.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,And I was just curious whether you think that further consolidation in the banking sector would increase or decrease financial stability and whether you have any concerns about the biggest bank in the U.S. getting even larger.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Chair Powell."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,There’s a lot of literature on that.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"has significant interest rate risk.” It said, “Interest rate risk measurement[s] ."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,failed” at SVB.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"And it said, “Banks with large unrealized losses face significant safety and soundness risks.” Why was that not alarming?"
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Well, I mean, I didn’t say it wasn’t alarming."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"It was—they’re pointing out something that they’re working on and that they’re on the case—that, that, you know, that—I’m not sure whether they mentioned—I think they did, actually."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,They mentioned that they had taken regulatory action matter—or supervisory action in the form of matters requiring attention.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,So I think that was also in the presentation.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think it was to say: Yes, this is a bank, and there are many other banks that are experiencing this—these things, and we’re on the case."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Let’s go to Victoria.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,VICTORIA GUIDA.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"I wanted to ask—obviously, with the recent bank turmoil, we’ve seen multiple banks buy other banks."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"So do you have any concerns about the fact that they’re, they’re getting larger in general?"
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I, I think it’s probably good policy that we, we don’t want the largest banks doing big acquisitions."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"It isn’t—it isn’t possible to make a kind of clean translation between one and the other, although firms are trying that and, you know, we’re trying it."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, ultimately, we have to be—we have to be honest and humble about our ability to make a precise assessment."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"So it does complicate the task of achieving, you know, a sufficiently restrictive stance."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"But I think, conceptually, though, we think that, you know, interest rates—in principle, we won’t have to raise the rates quite as high as we would have had this not happened."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"The extent of that is so hard to predict because we don’t know how persistent these, these effects will be."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,We don’t know how large they’ll be and how long they’ll take to be transmitted.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"But that’s, that’s what we’ll be watching carefully to find out."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,COLBY SMITH.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"Just to quickly follow up—what does it suggest about the scope for the Committee to pause rate increases perhaps as early as next month, even if the data remains strong then, if, if it’s having some kind of substitute effect?"
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s that—this is just something that we have to factor in as we—as we want to find ourselves.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"As I say, it does complicate—we, we have, you know, a broad understanding of monetary policy."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I guess I would say it this way: The assessment of, of the extent to which additional policy firming may be appropriate is going to be an ongoing one, meeting by meeting, and we’re going to be looking at the factors that I mentioned that—they’re listed in, in the statement, the obvious factors."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"That’s, that’s the way we’re going to be thinking about it."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, when banks raise their credit standards, that can also make credit tighter in a kind of broadly similar way."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, when we—we’ve been raising interest rates, and that raises the price of credit, and that, in a sense, restricts credit in the economy, working through the price mechanism."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,And that’s really all we can do.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think—I think I follow that up by saying, it’s, it’s quite impossible to have a precise estimate of the words to that effect."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, in principle, that’s the idea."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,That is the policy.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I, I think it’s actually a good outcome for the banking system."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"It also would have—would have been a good—a good outcome for the banking system had one of the regional banks bought, bought this company."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,And that could have been the outcome.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, ultimately, we have to follow the law in our agencies, and the law is, it goes to the, the least-cost bid."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,And—but this is—this is an exception for a failing bank.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,COLBY SMITH.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Colby Smith with the Financial Times.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"At the March meeting, you mentioned that tightening of credit conditions from the recent bank stress could be equal to one or more rate increases."
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, given developments since then, how has your estimate changed?"
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Now to Colby.
2023-05-03,Press Conf - Full Text,Yeah.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,JONNELLE MARTE.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,Jonnelle Marte with Bloomberg.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,Have you seen sufficient cooling in the housing market to bring inflation down?
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"For example, how does the recent rebound affect your forecasts, and how does it factor into monetary policy?"
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, we’re watching that situation carefully."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,And we certainly saw that over the course of the last year.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,We now see housing putting in a bottom and maybe even moving up a little bit.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"I do think we—we will see rents, rents and, and house prices filtering into, into housing services inflation."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I, I don’t see them coming up quickly."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"I, I do see them kind of—kind of wandering around at a relatively low level now, and that’s appropriate."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,JONNELLE MARTE.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"So certainly housing—very interest sensitive, and it’s the first place, really, or one of the first places, that’s either helped by low rates or, or that is held back by, by higher rates."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,Jonnelle.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I don’t think—that’s not something, something we’ve thought about a lot over time."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,But I wouldn’t say that that’s something that’s likely that we would do in the near term.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,Do you think you’ll have to target that with further rate increases?
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"So that’s, that’s—that’s the—that’s the Treasury part of the answer."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"We will, of course, continue to monitor conditions in money markets, and we’re prepared to make adjustments to make sure that, that monetary policy transmission works."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,Was there another part of your question?
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,VICTORIA GUIDA.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,Yeah—are you considering lowering the RRP rate to help take some pressure off banks?
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s actually been shrinking here lately.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"It doesn’t really look like that’s, that’s something that we would do."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,I think it’s—I think it’s a tool that we have.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"If we want to use it, we can."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,There are other tools we can—we can use to address money market issues.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you very much.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we, we have a number of—I would say the [ON] RRP [facility] doesn’t look like it’s, it’s pulling money out of—out of the banking system."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"We are starting at a very high level of reserves—and still elevated over RRP take-up, for that matter—so we don’t think reserves are likely to become scarce in the near term or even over the course of the year."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,Because—assuming monetary policy cannot handle alone the inflation or keep that inflation in check with the higher-level spending.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"Well, I think we, we look at everything."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"I will say, and many of my predecessors have said, that we’re on an unsustainable fiscal path and, and that needs to be addressed over time."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"But I think trying to get into, into that with lawmakers would be—would be kind of inappropriate, given our independence and our need to stick to our knitting."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,EDWARD LAWRENCE.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,Is there any conversation then about the Federal Reserve financing some of that debt that we’re seeing coming down the pike?
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,No.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we don’t see ourselves as, as, you know, the judges of appropriate fiscal policy."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,Under no circumstances.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,Courtenay.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,COURTENAY BROWN.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thanks for taking our questions, Chair Powell."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"So looking at the SEP, it looks like GDP for this year was raised significantly—your forecast for GDP this year."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s really hard to say at the—at the beginning of this which will be—which will be greater.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"The unemployment rate, meanwhile, was pulled downward."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"We—we hope and expect that other policymakers will respect our independence on, on monetary policy."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s really not my job.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,I don’t do that.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,We don’t just look at housing.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I think, you know, the way it works is the individual participants sit in their offices all over the country, and they write down their forecast and—including their most likely forecasts—including their rate forecast."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"And then they send it in on Friday afternoon, and we cumulate it, and then we publish it for you."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,So that’s how—that’s how they do that.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"Well, I don’t know that housing is, is itself going to be driving the rates picture, but it’s part of it."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,Let’s go to Edward.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,EDWARD LAWRENCE.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you for taking the question, Mr. Chairman."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,Edward Lawrence with Fox Business.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I want to go back to comments you made about, in the past, about unsustainable fiscal path."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,The CBO projects the federal deficit to be $2.8 trillion in 10 years.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,The CBO also says that federal debt will be $52 trillion by 2033.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,At what point do you talk more firmly with lawmakers about fiscal responsibility?
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,The adjustment process is very likely to involve both a reduction in the RRP facility and also in reserves.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I, I don’t want to deal with, with hypotheticals about different ways data might move."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"So that’s, that’s from the Treasury, which actually sets the, you know, the, the borrowings."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"So that was the, the origin, and it wasn’t really particularly about the labor market or wages."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"But as you—as you moved into—through ’21, into ’22, and now in ’23, I think many, many analysts believe that it will be important—an important part of getting inflation down, especially in the nonhousing services sector, to getting wage inflation back to a level that is sustainable, that is consistent with 2 percent inflation."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,We actually have seen wages broadly move down but just at a quite gradual pace.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"So— and that’s, you know, that’s a little bit of the finding of the Bernanke paper with Blanchard of a few weeks ago, which is very consistent with, with what I, I would think."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,Let’s go to Michael McKee.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,Inflation went way up.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHAEL MCKEE.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,You said in the past that you don’t like to surprise markets.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s kind of been the Fed’s view markets should have an idea of what you’re going to do before you go in.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,You also said a number of times that it would take a while to bring inflation down.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"You reiterated that again today and that we, we’d get to a point where inflation could be sticky."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I’m wondering, as we go into the next meetings, how Wall Street or others should look at your reaction function."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,What will you be reacting to—time or data?
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,Michael McKee from Bloomberg Radio and Television.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"In other words, if nothing much changes—if we’re looking at the same sort of labor market, the same sort of inflation levels in July or in September or November—will you move because you’ve said you feel you need to?"
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,So prices went way up.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"They had money in the bank, and they wanted to spend—they spent a lot on goods."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"And so should we take that as a sign that the Committee is more confident about the prospects of a soft landing—at least more—at least as it relates to what you were expecting in, in March?"
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,And we just don’t see that yet.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, hence, you see today’s policy decision: both, both to write down further rate hikes by the end of this year but also to, you know, to take—to, to moderate somewhat the pace with which we’re moving."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,CHRIS RUGABER.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,Quick follow-up.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mean, the last press conference you mentioned you didn’t see wages driving inflation."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, of course, at the same time—and because of that high demand, to some extent, supply chains got all snarled up."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, there was some research from the San Francisco Fed suggesting wages aren’t necessarily a key driver."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"Can you give us a little more, specifically, of how you see the tight labor market driving inflation at this point?"
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,Right.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I’m, I’m not going to comment on any particular paper, but I, I would say that the—I think the overall picture is that at the beginning in, you know, early 2021, inflation was really becoming from very strong demand for—largely for goods."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,People were still at home.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,But you’ve talked about the labor market today and the need for softening.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"At the Fed, we’ll be monitoring market conditions carefully as the Treasury refills the, the TGA."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"Is it time that’s going to require additional movement, or would it be reversal in inflation?"
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"And so, we, you know—we of course—we’re not—we don’t go out of our way to surprise markets or the public."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,So that’s how I think about it.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,Let’s go to Victoria.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,VICTORIA GUIDA.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,Victoria Guida with Politico.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,Could you talk about the balance sheet and how you’re thinking about it?
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,And that’s the number-one thing.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"What, what are you looking for to judge whether we’re approaching reserve scarcity?"
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"Also, are you considering lowering the RRP rate in order to take some pressure off banks?"
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"So let me say, first of all, on the Treasury part of it—if I can talk about that and then go back to the balance sheet."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"So on that—of course, we’ve been very focused on that for a couple of months, as everyone has."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,[The] Treasury has laid out its borrowing plans publicly.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,I think we all saw—I saw the Secretary’s comments yesterday to the effect that [the] Treasury has consulted widely with market participants about how to avoid market disruption and that they’re going to watch carefully for that.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,And is Treasury issuance going to affect that?
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’re, we’re committed to getting inflation down."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"So that’s, that’s the forecast."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"At the same time, our main focus has to be on getting the policy right."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"And that’s, that’s what we’re doing here, and that’s what we’ll do for the upcoming meetings."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"I will say the July meeting will be “live,” and we’ll just have to see."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think you’ll, you’ll see the data, you’ll hear Fed people talking about it, and, and markets will have to make a— make a judgment."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHAEL MCKEE.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"Well, do you think inflation is likely to continue coming down based on the lags and based on your threat of additional movement?"
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, we’ll—we do try to be transparent in our reaction function."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,Or are we going to be in a period where we’re not going to know what’s happening?
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, I, I think if you look at—if, if you just look at—I’ll just point you to the forecast."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"So inflation is running—core PCE inflation is running at about 4½, a little higher than 4½ percent."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"And the, the median FOMC participant thinks it will go down to 3.9 on a 12-month basis."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,This is by the end of this year.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,So that’s expecting pretty substantial progress.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"That’s, that’s a pretty significant decline for half a year."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,So wages will continue to increase.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"I continue to think—and this really hasn’t changed—that there is a path to getting inflation back down to 2 percent without having to see the kind of sharp downturn and, and large losses of employment that we’ve seen in so many past instances."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,MARK HAMRICK.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,Let’s go to Mark for the last question.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"And it’s becoming more about that as we—as we get into really service-sector inflation, which is the part of the economy where we have seen the least progress."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"And as I said, don’t think that was about—I didn’t—most folks would say now it wasn’t really about that—about wages at the beginning."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, we’re making judgments about what it will take to get inflation down to 2 percent in the aggregate."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"But we—you know, we, we look, and we see what’s going on."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"And so we don’t spend a lot of time— although we take notice of, of what’s going on, but we’re not, you know—we’re not involved in discussions or debates over, over strikes and things like that."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think, you know, we—there, there are structural issues that are really not for the Fed."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,So we spend a lot of time talking about that.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, it’s half of our mandate."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mean, it’s, it’s very—labor economics, you know, and the labor market are utterly central."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"So the topic of wages in the labor market and dynamics in the labor market could—is about as central a topic to our discussions as, as anything."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,Does that come up in your discussions?
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we, we, you know—what we’re talking about is having wage increases still at a very strong level but at a level that’s consistent with 2 percent inflation over time."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"And so I, I think we’ve seen some progress—all, all of the major measures of wages have, have moved down from extremely elevated—not extremely elevated—highly elevated levels a year or so ago, and they’re, they’re moving back down but, but quite gradually."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, and, you know, we want to see that, that process continue gradually."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"Of course, it’s great to see wage increases, particularly for people at the lower end of the income spectrum."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"But we want that as part of the process of getting inflation back down to 2 percent, which benefits everyone."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mean, inflation hurts those same people more than anyone else."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,Mark Hamrick with Bankrate.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"People on a fixed income are hurt the worst, and the fastest, by high inflation."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,Greg.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,GREG ROBB.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you so much, Chair Powell."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,Greg Robb from MarketWatch.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"I just wondered if the Committee has talked at all about the labor market and, and—there, there’s strikes now in Hollywood and now the United Autoworkers are talking about a possible strike."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mean, aren’t workers—they have—we have some—workers have power now and are going to be seeking higher wages."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,Wondering what your thoughts are now about systemic risk now that we’re about three months past the failure of Silicon Valley Bank.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"And also, specifically, what are the risks associated with commercial real estate as well as nonbank financials?"
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"And could you further elevate those risks with higher still rates, possibly for longer?"
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,It might be hard for me to identify something that we don’t worry about rather than that we do worry about.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,So we’re watching those things very carefully.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"And as we see things unfold—as we see what’s happening with credit conditions and, and also all the individual banks that are out there, you know, we’ll be able to take, to the extent it’s appropriate, we can take, if they’re macroeconomic implications, we can take that into account in our rate setting."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,And so I guess that’s what I would say.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,MARK HAMRICK.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,Can I just follow up on the last part of that?
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, our, our job generally involves worrying about a lot of things that may go wrong, and that would include the banks."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,Do you—do you risk further exacerbating those issues if you get up to another 50 basis points?
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"So that’s—and, and I was—I guess I meant to address that by saying as we—as we watch, we’ll see what’s happening."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"And if we—if we’re seeing the kind of tightening of conditions that, that you could be referring to, then we can factor that—because really, we’re—we use our—our rate tool is, is, you know, is—it really has macroeconomic purposes."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we’ll, we’ll take that into account."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"Of course, we have responsibility for financial stability as well."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,And that also is a factor that we’re always going to be considering.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"But we have to get inflation down to 2 percent, and we will."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, in terms of the events of March—as I mentioned earlier, we will be carefully monitoring that situation."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"And—but, you know, our jurisdiction at the Fed is over banks—actually bank holding companies and some banks."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,So I’m trying to think where to start.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,I’ll start with commercial real estate.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"We—of course, we’re watching that situation very carefully."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,There’s a substantial amount of commercial real estate in the banking system.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"A, a large part of it is in smaller banks."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"So that’s, that’s really our main focus."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s well distributed—to the extent it’s well distributedthen, then the system could, could take losses."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,So we’re well aware of that.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,We’re monitoring it carefully.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, it feels like—it feels like something that will be around for some time, as opposed to, you know, something that will suddenly hit and, and, you know, work its way into systemic risk."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,In terms of nonbank financials—financial sector—there’s been a ton of work.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, clearly in the—in the pandemic, it really was—it was the nonbank financial sector where, where issues really arose."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, there’s a lot of work going on in—with the Administration, in particular, leading that to try to address issues in the Treasury market and, and in all kinds of areas in the nonbank financial market."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"We do expect that there will be losses, but they’ll be—they’ll be banks that have concentrations, and those banks will experience larger losses."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"Could you also talk briefly about your outlook for wages and, given the recent slowdown in core services excluding housing, how far you think wages might need to fall in order to get inflation back in line?"
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,MEGAN CASSELLA.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,And so we’re—that’s why you see the SEP with—where it is.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"And if—and actually, you know, since we’re, we’re probably going to—we’re, we’re having real rates that are going to have to be meaningfully positive and significantly."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"So for us to get inflation down, that probably means— that, that certainly means that, that it will be appropriate to cut rates at such time as inflation is coming down really significantly."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"And again, we’re talking about a couple of years out."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think, as, as anyone can see, not a single person on the Committee wrote down a rate cut this year, nor do I think it is at all likely to be appropriate, if you think about it."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,Inflation has not really moved down.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,It has—it has not so far reacted much to our—to our existing rate hikes.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"So just to maintain a real rate, the nominal rate at that point—two years out, let’s say—should come down just to maintain real rates."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,And so we’re going have to keep at it.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,Julie.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,JULIE CHABANAS.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,I’m sorry.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Chair Powell."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"Julie Chabanas, AFP News Agency."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,The May job report showed a rebound in May in the Black workers’ unemployment.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"But what they’re showing is that as inflation comes down in the—in the forecast, if you don’t lower interest rates, then real rates are actually going up, right?"
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,Sure.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s, it’s possible."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"A—in a way, a strong labor market is—that, that gradually cools could, could aid that along—it could aid that along."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"But I, I guess I want to come back to the, the main thing, which is, though, simply this."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"We, we see—the Committee— as you can see from the SEP, the Committee is completely unified in the need to get inflation down to 2 percent and will do whatever it takes to get it down to 2 percent over time."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,That is our plan.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, we, we understand that allowing inflation to get entrenched into the—in the U.S. economy is the thing that we cannot, cannot allow to happen for the benefit of today’s workers and families and businesses but also for the future."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, you know, if you look two and three years out with, with the forecast—first of all, I wouldn’t—I wouldn’t put too much weight on forecasts even one year out because they’re, they’re so highly uncertain."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"Getting price stability back and, and restored will benefit generations of people as long as it’s sustained."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, and you should understand that that is our top priority."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,COURTENAY BROWN.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,Just a quick follow-up on that.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"I’m just a little confused because you said the Committee will do whatever it takes to get inflation down over time, but when I look at the SEP, inflation is still projected to be elevated next year, but the fed funds rate is lower than where it is now."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,Can you help me understand that?
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,And it really is the bedrock of the economy.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, I—I would just say it this way."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,Is it consistent with the Fed’s maximum-employment mandate?
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"I wouldn’t say—that’s, you know—as a factual matter, that’s correct."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"We do need to see, you know, rents bottom out here or at least stay quite low in terms of their increases because we want—we want the, you know, we want inflation to come down."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"And rental is, is a very large part of the CPI—about a third—and it’s about half of that for the PCE."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,So it’s important.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,And so we’re—it’s something that we’re watching very carefully.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,Can you talk about how you’re thinking about that and how that played into today’s outcome?
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s part of the overall picture.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"What you see is— look at—look at core inflation over the past six months, a year."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,You’re just not seeing a lot of progress—not the kind of progress we want to see.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"And that, that’s—it’s hard to avoid that."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, the Committee—people on the Committee—the median went up significantly, so that the median participant now thinks that core PCE inflation on a 12-month basis will be 3.9 percent this year."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, once again, every year for the past three years, it’s gone up over the course of the year, and that’s doing that again."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we see that, and we see that inflation forecasts are coming in low again, and we see that—that that tells us that we need to do more."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"I wouldn’t say it’s the decisive part, but take a step back."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,Are you worried about that—about this rebound?
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,And we did hear Governor Waller talk about how an uptick in housing might mean that there’s not going to be as much relief coming or a shorter bit of relief than we thought.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,We heard Governor Waller talk about how—I’ll back up.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we are, of course, worried about—there are—there are long- standing differences in racial and ethnic groups across, across our labor market."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s a factor that we don’t—we can’t really address with our tools.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"But we do consider that when we’re thinking about what constitutes maximum employment—it is, for us, a broad and inclusive goal."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,And so we do watch that.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"But remember, all unemployment, including Black unemployment, has been bouncing around right near historic lows—historic modern lows here."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we’re still talking about, I mean, what is as strong a labor market as we’ve seen in, you know, a half- century here in the United States."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,We haven’t quite seen the slowdown in rents show up in CPI yet.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"So overall unemployment of 3.7 percent is, is higher—three- tenths higher than it was measured to be at the last—a month ago."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"And so it’s a very, very tight labor market."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.

2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,MEGAN CASSELLA.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,I want to follow up first a little bit just on the rent question on housing.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, still, it’s extraordinarily low."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"We, we don’t want to do—we, we want to do that with the minimum damage we can to the economy, of course."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"That’s, that’s how we do it."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s all.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"It seems like it’s getting more “immaculate,” rather than more messy."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,So what’s the—what’s the narrative here?
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"According to GDP—you’ve doubled your, your estimate of GDP."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,Demand’s not coming down all that fast.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,The labor market’s going to be stronger it looks like—it’s not coming from there.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,HOWARD SCHNEIDER.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,Sure.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I’m wondering in, in this sort of—where’s the disinflation coming from?"
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"I was just wondering if you could help us understand the, the narrative here because it feels like there’s been a level shift in the—in the dots, stronger GDP, less of a hit to unemployment, slower progress on inflation."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,Howard Schneider with Reuters.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks.

2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"I would say about, about July two things: (1) [the] decision hasn’t been made, (2) I do expect that it will be a “live” meeting."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"Then last December, after four consecutive 75 basis point hikes, we moderated to a pace of 50—of a 50 basis point hike and then this year to three 25 basis point hikes at sequential meetings."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,So it seemed to us to make obvious sense to moderate our rate hikes as we got closer to our destination.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"So the decision to consider not hiking at every meeting and ultimately to hold rates steady at this meeting, I would just say it’s a continuation of, of that process."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"The main issue that we’re focused on now is determining the extent of additional policy firming that may be appropriate to return inflation to 2 percent over time—so that the pace of the increases and the ultimate level of increases are separate variables, given how far it—we have come."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,It may make sense for rates to move higher but at a more moderate pace.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,I want to stress one more thing—and that is that the Committee decision made today was only about this meeting.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"So you’re, you’re right that the data came in, I would say, consistent with, but on the high side of, expectations."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"We didn’t make any decision about going forward, including what would happen at the next meeting, including—we did not decide or really discuss anything about going to an every-other-meeting kind of an approach or, or really any other approach."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,COLBY SMITH.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,So there was no kind of initial debate about the possibility of July— any sense of the initial support at this stage for that move?
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"So again, we didn’t—we didn’t make a decision about July."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mean, of course, it, it came up in the—in the meeting from time to time."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"But really, the focus was, was on what to do today."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,We really were focused on what to do at this meeting.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"And if you go back to the old—the former SEP—the last SEP in March, you will see that [compared with March, projected real GDP] growth moved up."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"These are not huge moves, but growth estimates moved up a bit."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,Unemployment estimates moved down a bit.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, and that’s, again, probably going to come slower than we would [previously have expected it to come into] effect."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"That leaves, you know, the big sector, which is a little more than half, pardon me, of the—of core PCE inflation that’s not housing services."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, we see only the earliest signs of disinflation there."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s a sector—it’s a very broad and diverse sector.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"I would say [that,] in a number of the parts of that sector, the largest cost would be wage cost."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s the service sector, so it’s, it’s heavily labor intensive."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"In fact, I think any forecast that people are making right now about inflation coming down this year will, will contain a big dose of—this year and next year—will contain a, a good amount of, of disinflation [coming] from that source."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,And I think many analysts would say that the key to getting inflation down there is to have a continuing loosening in labor market conditions—which we have seen.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,We need to see that continue.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"I would almost say that the, the conditions that we need to see in place to get inflation down are, are coming into place."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,And that would be [real GDP] growth meaningfully below trend.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,It would be a labor market that’s loosening.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,It would be goods pipelines getting healthier and healthier and that kind of thing.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"There, there—the things are in place that we need to see, but the process of that actually working on inflation is going to take some time."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"We have actually seen, you know—I go through a number of indicators suggesting there has been some loosening in labor market conditions."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"So at the outset, going back 15 months, the key issue was how fast to move rates up, and we moved very quickly by historical standards."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,And it’s really a matter of time as that goes through the pipeline.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,In terms of housing services inflation—that’s another big piece.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,Inflation estimates moved up a bit.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, all three of those kind of point in the same direction—which is, you know, that perhaps more [monetary policy] restraint will be necessary than we had thought at the last meeting."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"So although the level, frankly, is, is pretty—the level of 5.6 [percent] is pretty consistent, if you think about it, where the [expected] federal funds rate was trading before the bank incidents of early March."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,So—but so we’ve kind of gone back to that.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"So your question is, where’s the—where’s the disinflation going to come from?"
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I, you know, I don’t think the story has really changed."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, and you are seeing there that new rents in new, new leases are, are coming in at low levels."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,We—the Committee has consistently said and believed that the process of getting inflation down is going to be a gradual one.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I think you go back to the—to the three-part framework for [analyzing] core PCE inflation—which is, we think, as good an indicator as you can have for where inflation is going forward."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,You start with goods.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"With goods, we need to see continued healing in supply conditions—supply-side conditions."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"They’ve definitely improved a substantial amount, but if you talk to people in business, they will say it’s not back to where it was."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"So that’s, that’s one thing."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"And that should enable goods prices to continue—goods, goods inflation to continue to come down over time."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s going to take some time.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"So as we started our rate hikes early last year, we said there were three issues that would need to be addressed kind of in sequence—that of the speed of tightening, the level to which rates would need to go, and then a period of time over which we’d need to keep policy restrictive."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, I guess I would—I guess I would go back to the beginning of this tightening cycle to address that."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,The labor market remains very tight.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"Over the past three months, payroll job gains averaged a robust 283,000 jobs per month."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,The unemployment rate moved up but remained low in May at 3.7 percent.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,There are some signs that supply and demand in the labor market are coming into better balance.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"The labor force participation rate has moved up in recent months, particularly for individuals aged 25 to 54 years."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"Nominal wage growth has shown signs of easing, and job vacancies have declined so far this year."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"In our Summary of Economic Projections, the median projection has real GDP growth at 1.0 percent this year and 1.1 percent next year, well below the median estimate of the longer-run normal growth rate."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"While the jobs-to-workers gap has declined, labor demand still substantially exceeds the supply of available workers."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,The median unemployment rate projection in the SEP rises to 4.1 percent at the end of this year and 4.5 percent at the end of next year.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,Inflation remains well above our longer-run 2 percent goal.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"Over the 12 months ending in April, total PCE proces—prices rose 4.4 percent; excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 4.7 percent."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"In May, the 12-month change in the consumer price index came in at 4 percent, and the change in the core, core CPI was 5.3 percent."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,Inflation has moderated somewhat since the middle of last year.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"Nonetheless, inflation pressures continue to run high, and the process of getting inflation back down to 2 percent has a long way to go."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"FOMC participants expect supply and demand conditions in the labor market to come into better balance over time, easing upward pressures on inflation."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"The median projection in the SEP for total PCE inflation is 3.2 percent this year, 2.5 percent next year, and 2.1 percent in 2025."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,Committee participants generally expect subdued growth to continue.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"Although growth in consumer spending has picked up this year, activity in the housing sector remains weak, largely reflecting higher mortgage rates."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"Transcript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference June 14, 2023 CHAIR POWELL."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,Good afternoon.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,My colleagues and I remain squarely focused on our dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"We understand the hardship that high inflation is causing, and we remain strongly committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,Price stability is the responsibility of the Federal Reserve.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"Without price stability, the economy doesn’t work for anyone."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,Higher interest rates and slower output growth also appear to be weighing on business fixed investment.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"In particular, without price stability, we will not achieve a sustained period of strong labor market conditions that benefit all."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"We have raised our policy interest rate by 5 percentage points, and we’ve continued to reduce our securities holdings at a brisk pace."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’ve covered a lot of ground, and the full effects of our tightening have yet to be felt."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"In light of how far we’ve come in tightening policy, the uncertain lags with which monetary policy affects the economy, and potential headwinds from credit tightening, today we decided to leave our policy interest rate unchanged and to continue to reduce our securities holdings."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"Looking ahead, nearly all Committee participants view it as likely that some further rate increases will be appropriate this year to bring inflation down to 2 percent over time."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,And I will have more to say about monetary policy after briefly reviewing economic developments.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"The U.S. economy slowed significantly last year, and recent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a modest pace."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"Since early last year, the FOMC has significantly tightened the stance of monetary policy."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"Core PCE inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, is projected to run higher than total inflation, and the median projection has been revised in the SEP up to 3.9 percent this year."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,The Fed’s monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and price—and stable prices for the American people.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,Reducing inflation is likely to require a period of below-trend growth and some softening of labor market conditions.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,Restoring price stability is essential to set the stage for achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the longer run.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"To conclude: We understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,Everything we do at the Fed is in service to our public mission.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,We will do everything we can to achieve our maximum-employment and price-stability goals.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,We remain committed to bringing inflation—bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal and to keeping longer-term inflation expectations well anchored.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,And I look forward to your questions.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,Colby.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,COLBY SMITH.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,Colby Smith with the Financial Times.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,I’m curious what gives you and the Committee the confidence that waiting will not be counterproductive at a time when the monthly pace of core inflation is still so elevated.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"Interest rate–sensitive sectors like housing, while they’ve felt the drag of the past Fed actions, have started to recover in some regions, and financial conditions, you know, most recently were easing."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"Despite elevated inflation, longer-term inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters, as well as measures from financial markets."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"We will continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting, based on the totality of incoming data and their implications for the outlook for economic activity and inflation, as well as the balance of risks."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"I hasten to add, as always, that these projections are not a Committee decision or plan."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"My colleagues and I are acutely aware that high inflation imposes hardship, as it erodes purchasing power, especially for those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"We are highly attentive to the risks that high inflation poses to both sides of our mandate, and we’re strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent objective."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"As I noted earlier, since early last year, we’ve raised our policy rate by 5 percentage points."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"We have been seeing the effects of our policy tightening on demand in the most interest rate–sensitive sectors of the economy, especially housing and investment."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"It will take time, however, for the full effects of monetary restraint to be realized, especially on inflation."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"The economy is facing headwinds from tighter credit conditions for households and businesses, which are likely to weigh on economic activity, hiring, and inflation."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"If the economy does not evolve as projected, the path for policy will adjust as appropriate to foster our maximum- employment and price-stability goals."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,The extent of these effects remains uncertain.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"As I noted earlier, nearly, nearly all Committee participants expect that it will be appropriate to raise interest rates somewhat further by the end of the year."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"But at this meeting, considering how far and how fast we’ve moved, we judged it prudent to hold the target range steady to allow the Committee to assess additional information and its implications for monetary policy."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"In determining the extent of additional policy firming that may be appropriate to return inflation to 2 percent over time, the Committee will take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial developments."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"In our SEP, participants wrote down their individual assessments of an appropriate path for the federal funds rate based on what each participant judges to be the most likely scenario going forward."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"If the economy evolves as projected, the median participant projects that the appropriate level of the federal funds rate will be 5.6 percent at the end of this year, 4.6 percent at the end of 2024, and 3.4 percent at the end of 2025."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"For the end of this year, the median projection is ½ percentage point higher than in our March projections."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"In light of how far we’ve come in tightening policy, the uncertain lags with which monetary policy affects the economy, and potential headwinds from credit tightening, the Committee decided at today’s meeting to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 5 to 5¼ percent and to continue the process of significantly reducing our securities holdings."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,Nick.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’re, you know, of course, we’re going to get inflation down to 2 percent over time."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,So there’s not any certainty or agreement in the profession on how long it takes.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,And you can pretty much find research to support whatever answer you would like on that.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"But broader demand, and spending, and, and asset values, and things like that—they just take longer."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"But it’s still the case that what you see is interest-sensitive spending is affected very, very quickly—so housing, and durable goods, and things like that."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"So that’s, that’s different."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"So in that sense, tightening happens much sooner than it used to in a world where— where news was in newspapers and not, you know, not on, on the wire."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"So if you—if you look back when we were lifting off, we started talking about lifting off—by the time we had lifted off, the two-year [interest rate], which is a pretty good estimate of where [monetary] policy is going, had gone from 20 basis points to 200 basis points."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"Of course, these days, financial conditions begin to tighten well in advance of actual rate hikes."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s, it’s sort of standard thinking that monetary policy affects economic activity with long and variable lags."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"So it’s a—it’s a challenging thing in, in economics."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,Yeah.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,Have you learned things over the past year that give you some sense of timeline for when to expect those lags to come into effect?
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"I wanted to ask further on the lag effects—when you’re considering when you would hike again throughout the course of the year, are there things that you would expect to kick in as those lag effects come, come into effect that would inform your decisions?"
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks for taking our questions.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,Rachel Siegel from the Washington Post.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Chair Powell."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, I, I would say again that I think that, over time, the balance of risks, as we move from very, you know—from interest rates that are effectively zero now to 5 percentage points with, with an SEP calling for additional hikes—I think we’ve moved much closer to our destination, which is that sufficiently restrictive rate, and I think that means by—almost by definition that the—that the risks of, of sort of overdoing it and under, underdoing it are, are getting closer to being in balance."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"I still think, and my, my colleagues agree, that, that the risks to inflation are to the upside still."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,So we don’t—we don’t think we’re there with inflation yet because we’re just looking at the data.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"And if you look at the—at the full range of, of inflation data, particularly the core data, you just—you just aren’t seeing a lot of progress over the last year."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"Headline, of course, inflation has come down materially, but, as you know, we look at core [inflation] as a better indicator of where inflation overall is going."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"Sufficiently—so I think, you know, what, what we’d like to see is credible evidence that inflation is topping out and then beginning to come down."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we’re, we’re looking at the calendar."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"That’s, that’s what we want to see— of course that’s what we want to see."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think it’s—I think the reason we’re, we’re comfortable pausing is that we are still—much of the tightening took place over last summer and later into the year."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I think it’s, it’s reasonable to think that some of that may come into effect."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we’re, you know—I think stretching out into a more moderate pace is appropriate to, to allow you to make that judgment of sufficiency, you know, more—with more data over time."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,Rachel.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,RACHEL SIEGEL.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I, I think it’s—it’s also—we understand that there are lags, but remember that it’s, it’s more than a year since financial conditions began tightening."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’re, we’re looking at what’s happening in the economy."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,We’re having to make these judgments.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"Again, it’s one of the main reasons why it makes sense to go at a slightly more moderate pace now as we seek that, that ultimate—I can’t point to—that ultimate endpoint."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, as you noted, a significant portion of core inflation is now housing prices."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,And then we’ve had some quirks in used-car prices.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"So given that these trends are in place, I guess I’m sort of asking the flip side of Nick’s question: Why signal additional rate hikes?"
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,Aren’t things headed in the direction you need?
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,Why not simply give it even more time?
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"Or—it’s surprising to see so much hawkishness in the dots, given what we’re seeing recently."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,housing has come in pretty low in the past couple of months.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, you know, we’ve—remember, we’ve—we’re two and a half years into this—or two and a quarter years into this."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"And forecasters, including Fed forecasters, have consistently thought that inflation was about to turn down and, you know, traditional—you know, typically forecasted that it would and been wrong."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,So I think if you—I think if you look at the—at core PCE inflation overall—look at it over the last six months—you’re just not seeing a lot of progress.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s running, and it’s running at a level, you know, over 4½ percent—far above our, our target and not really, you know, moving down."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,We want to see it moving down decisively.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,NICK TIMIRAOS.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,Yeah.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,You mentioned that many of the trends are in place that you want to see—core services ex.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,I can’t point to a specific data point.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think we’ll see it when we see inflation, you know, really, really flattening out reliably and then starting to soften."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,I think we’ll know that we’re—that it’s working.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, ideally, by, by taking a little more time, we won’t go well past the level where we need to go."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,RACHEL SIEGEL.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,I was curious if you could give us an update on what you’re seeing on credit tightening since the bank incidents for March and how you’re teasing that out apart from these lag effects.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,Chris Rugaber at Associated Press.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, that’s something we’re going to be watching, of course."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, if we were to see what, what we would view as significant tightening beyond what would normally be expected because of, of this channel, then, you know, we would factor that into account on, on—in, in making rate decisions."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"So that’s, that’s how we think about it."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,Let’s go to Chris.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,CHRIS RUGABER.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"So it’s, it’s too early still to, to try to assess the full extent of what that might mean."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, you know, then that makes it challenging, of course."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,Is it 6?
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mean, it’s, it’s just the idea that we’re trying to get this right."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"And this is—if you think of the two things as separate variables, then I think—I think that the skip—I shouldn’t call it a skip—the, the decision makes sense."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,NICK TIMIRAOS.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,I know you said July is live.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"With only one June employment—with only the June employment and the CPI report for June due to be released before the July meeting—you get the ECI after, you get the Senior Loan Officer Survey after, you get some bank earnings at the end of next month—what incremental information will the Committee be using to inform their judgment on whether this is, in fact, a skip or a, a longer pause?"
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"We, we—it would be early to see those, but we don’t know what the extent is."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"Well, I think you’re adding that to the, the data that we’ve seen since the last meeting, too."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I think that’s a full quarter, and I think you can—you can draw more conclusions from that than you can from any six—any six- week period."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,We’ll look at those things.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,We’ll also look at the evolving risk picture.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,We’ll look at what’s happening in the financial sector.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’ll look at all the data, the evolving outlook, and we’ll make a decision."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, we—since we chose to maintain rates at this meeting, it’ll really be a three-month period of data that we can look at."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,Jeanna.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think it allows the economy a little more time to adapt as we—as we make our decisions going forward, and we’ll get to see, you know—we haven’t really—we don’t know the full extent of, of the consequences of the banking turmoil that we’ve seen."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,So that gives us more information to make decisions.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,Where is sufficiently restrictive?
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mean, not to be flippant, but I don’t lose weight just by buying a gym membership—I have to actually go to the gym."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,Sixteen of your colleagues put down a higher year-end ’23 rate today.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,A majority of you think you’re going to have to go up by 50 basis points this year.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,So why not just rip off the Band-Aid and raise rates today?
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,We may try to make better decisions.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"So the—first, I would say that the, the question of speed is a separate question from the question—from the—from, from that of level."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"So—and I think if you look at the SEP, that is our estimate—our individual—it’s, it’s really a cumulation of our individual estimates of how far to go."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"I, I mentioned how, how we got to those numbers."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"In terms of speed, it’s, it’s what I said at the beginning, which is, speed was very important last year."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"As we get closer and closer to the destination—and, according to the SEP, we’re not so far away from the destination, in most people’s accounting—it’s, it’s reasonable—it’s common sense to go a little slower, just as it was reasonable to go from 75 basis points to 50 to 25 at every meeting."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"And so the Committee thought overall that it was appropriate to moderate the pace, if only slightly."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,Then there are benefits to that.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,Okay.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,JEANNA SMIALEK.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,We’ll have some more time to see that unfold.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"Chair Powell, what’s the value in, in pausing and signaling future hikes versus just hiking now?"
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, there’s really no way to know."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"But it’s—it is—it’s, it’s what people think as of today, and as the—as the data come in, it, it can move around during the intermeeting period."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,It could wind up back in the same place.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,But it really will be data driven.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,I can’t—I can’t tell you that that I ever have a lot of confidence that we can see where the—where the federal funds rate will be that far in advance.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"It can be—it can actually, in reality, wind up being lower or higher."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,Steve.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"Mr. Chairman, thanks for taking my question."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,You had said back at the end of May that you thought risks were getting closer to being into balance.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"Is that still the case, or has your mind changed about the balance of risks out there?"
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"And also, could you give us an idea of what would be a sufficiently restrictive funds rate?"
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"Is the—obviously, the current rate, according to the Committee, is not sufficiently restrictive."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks for taking our questions.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,STEVE LIESMAN.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s based on our, our own individual assessments of what the most likely path of the economy is."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,Is it 5.6?
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"And so it’s, it’s really the, the data."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"In terms of, you know—we, we always write down at these meetings what we think the appropriate terminal rate will be at the end of this year."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"You obviously, in your forecasts, marked up the sort of path for growth, marked down the path for unemployment, and marked up the path for inflation pretty notably."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"I wonder, you know, since March, what has changed to make you think that the economy’s a lot more resilient and inflation is going to be a lot more stubborn?"
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"And given that, you know, why do you feel confident that this is as high as you’re going to have to revise the federal funds rate?"
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"Or do you think it’s possible we could have even a higher than 5.6 percent terminal by the end of this, this cycle?"
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, I—I mean, on the first part, I just think we’re following the data and also the outlook."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"Jeanna Smialek, New York Times."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"And it’s, it’s just remarkable."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"And that’s really, if you think about it—that’s what’s driving it."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s job creation.
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s, it’s wages moving up."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s, it’s supporting spending, which in turn is supporting hiring."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"And it’s, it’s really the engine, it seems, that is—that is driving the economy."
2023-06-14,Press Conf - Full Text,"The economy is—the labor market, I think, has surprised many, if not all, analysts over the last couple of years with its extraordinary resilience, really."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"There’s just a lot of, I think, constructive diversity of opinion that, that helps us make— informs our deliberations—helps us make, I hope, better decisions."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,STEVE MATTHEWS.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,And is the reason for optimism that inflation has come down and you still have a strong labor market?
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mean, does that add to the optimism?"
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’ve seen softening through other—not through unemployment, not through higher unemployment."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"And that’s, that’s a really good thing."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"I would—I would say, though, that there’s a pathway, and, yes, that’s, that’s a good way to think about it."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’ve, we’ve seen so far the beginnings of disinflation without any real costs in the labor market."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,I would just also say the historical record suggests that there’s very likely to be some softening in labor market conditions.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"And consistent with having a soft landing, you would—you would have some softening in labor market conditions, and that’s still likely as we—as we go forward with this process."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,But it’s a good thing to date that we haven’t— we haven’t really seen that.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,Having an independent staff forecast as well as the individual participant forecasts is really a strength of our—of our process.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,I wouldn’t use the term “optimism” about this yet.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"I just want to note that it’s—that our staff produces its own forecast, which is independent of the forecasts that we as FOMC participants produce."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,And I’m wondering if the staff has changed its view on the likelihood of a recession being likely and if you personally have changed your view in terms of becoming more confident that you can achieve a soft landing.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"So—but it’s a long way from assured, and, and, you know, we have a lot left to go to see that happen."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’ve seen softening through, you know, job openings coming down part of the way back to more normal levels; the quits rate, so people are not quitting as much; we’ve seen participation—people coming in, and so labor supply has, has improved, which has lowered the temperature in the labor market, which was quite overheated, you know, going back a year or so."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"I’m saying we would—we’d be comfortable cutting rates when we’re comfortable cutting rates, and that won’t be this year, I don’t think."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"It would be—you know, many people wrote down rate cuts for next year."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,I think the median was several for next year.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"And that’s just going to be a judgment that we have to make then, a full year from now, and it’ll be about how confident we are that inflation is, in fact, coming down to our 2 percent goal."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"So the staff now has a noticeable slowdown in growth starting later this year in the forecast, but given the resilience of the economy recently, they are no longer forecasting a recession."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,Steve.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"A good part of Wall Street has become more confident that the Fed is going to be able to engineer a soft landing, and they’ve reduced their forecast for a recession."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"So it’s, it has been my view consistently that we do have a shot, and my base case is that we will be able to achieve inflation moving back down to our target without the kind of really significant downturn that results in high levels of job losses that we’ve seen in some past—in some past instances, many past instances of tightening that look like ours."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s been my view.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"That’s, that’s still my view."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I think, you know, that that’s sort of consistent with, with what I see today."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,STEVE MATTHEWS.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we’re seeing that kind of cooling, and that’s, that’s very healthy, and, you know, we hope it continues."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, overall, the banking system remains strong and resilient."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,Jeff.

2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s been over four months since a handful of regional banks, including Silicon Valley Bank, failed."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"When you look at credit conditions now, given Banc of California’s acquisition of PacWest, does this acquisition suggest the full impact has not been felt, or are you comfortable saying that we’ve seen most of the ripple effects that may have occurred at this point?"
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,And how does this play into your outlook for policy?
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I don’t want to comment on any particular merger proposal, but I will say, things have settled down for sure out there."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,Deposit flows have stabilized.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,Capital and liquidity remain strong.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,Aggregate bank lending was stable quarter over quarter and is up significantly year over year.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,Banking-sector profits generally are coming in strong this quarter.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,I’m not giving you any numerical guidance around that.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"But that’s the way I would think about it, is you’d start—you’d stop raising long before you got to 2 percent inflation, and you’d start cutting before you got to 2 percent inflation, too, because we don’t see ourselves getting to 2 percent inflation until—you know, all the way back to 2—until 2025 or so."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,We’d really want to be sure that inflation is coming down in a sustainable level.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,JEFF COX.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,Jeff Cox from CNBC.com.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"You and other Fed officials in the past have suggested that you don’t need to keep hiking until inflation hits 2 percent, that—as long as you see continued progress."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I’m wondering, how close do you need to get with the inflation numbers coming down?"
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"How many months of data do you need to see that will—that will give you sufficient confidence, and how, how far does this fight need to go before you’re willing to kind of declare victory on it?"
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,And it’s hard to make—I’m not going to try to make a numerical assessment of when and where that would be.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"That’s, that’s clearly not the appropriate way to think about it."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, and in fact, if you look at our forecast, we, we—the median participant—and, again, these are forecasting out years, so take them with a grain of salt."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"But people are cutting rates next year because, because, you know, the federal funds rate is at a restrictive level now."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"So if we see inflation coming down credibly, sustainably, then we don’t need to be at a restrictive level anymore."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"We can, you know, we can move back to a—to a neutral level and then below a neutral level at a certain point."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think we would, you know, we would—we, of course, would be very careful about that."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,So the idea that we would keep hiking until inflation gets to 2 percent—it would be a prescription [for a policy] of going way past the target.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,I’m not going—I’m not saying that at all.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"And that’s, that’s a good thing, and the public experiences that, as I mentioned earlier."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"So if it’s sort of—sort of stubbornly in maybe the high 2s, you wouldn’t necessarily cut rates?"
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you, Chair Powell."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"First, let me compliment your tie, the choice of tie."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s a good color.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,So thanks for taking our questions.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"So the Beige Book, it said, “Input cost pressures remained elevated for services firms but eased notably” for manufacturing sectors."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"Is that an indication that there’s a, a wage inflation pressure?"
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,EDWARD LAWRENCE.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,And how do you target pressure on the wage inflation without pushing the economy into a recession?
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I think that, as it relates to goods, it’s really an indication that supply chains and, and shortages are easing."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"And so, what was the first part of it?"
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,EDWARD LAWRENCE.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, wage inflation."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"Like, how do you—how do you target wage inflation without pushing an economy into a recession?"
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,I don’t—I don’t think we’re targeting wage inflation.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,Edward.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’re seeing that with goods, in particular, with supply chains and shortages moving, and we’re seeing—so I think going forward, monetary policy will be important, particularly in that, in the sector, in the nonhousing services sector."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"Of course, we’re still watching, you know, the situation carefully and monitoring, you know, monitoring conditions in, in the banking sector."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"For core inflation, I’d say there also—there has been a role for, for most—for, for both factors, both that I mentioned."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"Clearly, for goods, normalization of supply conditions is playing an important role, as is the reversal, the beginning of the reversal, of spending—back into services and away from goods."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,And take autos as an example.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"The combination of an increase in sales and inventories, while, while vehicle inflation has decelerated, points to a substantial role for supply, but there’s also a role for demand, as, you know, the loans and things like that are more expensive."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,So they’re both working there.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,Housing services inflation now starts to move down.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,So we think both of those—both of those sources of disinflation are playing an important role.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,RACHEL SIEGEL.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,I see.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"And just to follow up, do you think that of those two sources, that core will rely more heavily on seeing an impact from rate hikes, or is there a more even split there, too?"
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think monetary policy is going to be important going forward because we, we’re sort of reaping now the benefits of the—of the reversal of some of the very specific pandemic things."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, I would say, monetary policy is working about as we expect, and we think—we think it’ll play an important role going forward, in particular in nonhousing services, where, really, we think that’s, that’s where the labor market will come in as a very, very important factor."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,I think what we’re—what we’re looking for is a broad cooling in labor market conditions.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,So wages have actually been gradually moving down.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,Victoria.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,VICTORIA GUIDA.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,Hi.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,Victoria Guida with Politico.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"I wanted to ask about the SEP, which suggests that you would cut rates as overall and core PCE get to around or under 3 percent."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"And so I’m wondering, is the level of inflation what’s sort of important there as you think about getting to 2 percent and when you might start cutting rates, or is the speed at which inflation is falling also important?"
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, we, we monitor these things, and we’ll keep an eye on them, but, really, that’s something that’s, that’s handled at that level and not— MICHELLE SMITH."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,I think you’d take everything into account when you start cutting rates.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"It would—it would depend on the whole, on a wide range of things."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"And when, when people are writing down rate cuts next year, you know, it just is a sense that inflation is coming down, and we’re comfortable that it’s coming down, and it’s time to start cutting rates."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think—but I mean, there’s a lot of uncertainty between what happens, you know, in the next meeting cycle, let alone the next year, let alone the year after that."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"So it’s, it’s hard to say exactly what happens there, what’s motivating people."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,VICTORIA GUIDA.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,I think you’d take both into account.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,And that’s what we’re seeing.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"Not our job, not our role."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,They’re still at levels what would—that would be consistent over a long period of time with 2 percent inflation.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"Nonetheless, we’re making progress there."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"And by so many indicators, labor market demand is cooling."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,You can—you can look at surveys by workers and businesses who see that.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,You can look at the quits rate normalizing.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,You can look at job openings coming down.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"Not for us to comment on, on contract negotiations."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"You can look at just job creation in the, the establishment survey has, you know—it’s still at a high level, but it was at, really, an extraordinarily high level for most of the last two years."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I think we see that, and it’s happening at a gradual pace."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"So that’s actually not a bad thing, in a sense, because if, if what we see is a labor market, very strong demand for labor, which is really the engine of the economy—people are getting hired, many people going back to work, getting wages, spending money—and that’s really what’s driving the economy but that it’s gradually slowing, it’s gradually cooling, that’s a good prescription for getting where we want to get."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,EDWARD LAWRENCE.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,But still we see a push to raise minimum wage.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’re seeing a lot of unions go on strike or threaten strike, and the common thing is, they come out with agreements like big pay increases, like UPS, and we have the autoworkers coming up."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"Are you concerned then about a trend of series of big unions, these contracts, pushing wage inflation then?"
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"So you see cooling, particularly in private sector, in the last, you know, in the last report."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"In terms of the, the actual effect on—if you think of a particular set of banks that were, were affected because of their size and business model and things like that, that were more affected by the turmoil in March than others, it’s very hard, as I mentioned; it’s very hard to sort of tease out the effects on this very large economy of ours from them tightening."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,What does that mean for the Fed and being sure that inflation will come down to target?
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,The SLOOS has been telling us for more than a year that banking conditions are tightening.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"Mr. Chairman, Mark Hamrick with Bankrate."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,MARK HAMRICK.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,Let’s go to Mark Hamrick.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"So why not be in a situation where, where you’re just much more ready in case you—in case you need to access the discount window?"
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,It can be a little clunkier and not as quick as it needs to be sometimes.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"We did find, as you know, during the events of March and that, you know, that it’s a little clunkier."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, yes, banks are now working to see that they are ready to use the discount window, and we are strongly encouraging them to do that—banks broadly."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,And yes to both sides of that.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,Yes.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,So that’s a very important thing.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"I’m wondering if, since the bank failures of the spring, if you’ve seen signs that banks have taken more steps to be proactive in assuring that they’re ready to use that facility if they need to and if you have any sort of thoughts on whether policies might be appropriate for making sure that banks sort of test regularly to, to show that they are prepared to use it."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,I have a question about the discount window.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,Kyle Campbell with American Banker.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thanks, Chair Powell."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"But what tends to happen, though, is, financial conditions get in and out of alignment with what we’re doing, and, and, ultimately, over time, we get where we need to go."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,EVAN RYSER.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,If I could also ask about the SEP from June that showed rate cuts—do you expect the Fed to cut nominal rates next year while also continuing QT?
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"So that, that could happen."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"The question is, you know, is that consistent with, with—so if you think about both of them as normalization, imagine it’s a world where things are okay, and it’s time to bring rates down from what are restrictive levels to more normal levels."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,You’ve talked in the past about getting the housing market back into better balance—excuse me—and also that the market might have bottomed.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"Normalization, in the case of, of the balance sheet, would be to reduce QT or to continue it, depending on where you are in the cycle."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, really, the active tool of monetary policy is rates."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,But you can imagine circumstances in which it would be appropriate to have them working in what might be seen to be just different ways.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,But that wouldn’t be the case.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,Let’s go to Kyle.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,KYLE CAMPBELL.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,So they are two independent things.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"Where do you see that situation in balance, or lack thereof, right now, particularly with the restrained, constrained inventory of existing homes that might otherwise be coming onto market at a time when existing homeowners are reluctant to move and, of course, also all of that happening with the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage still around 7 percent on the heels of Fed tightening and with what you’re talking about tightening industry lending standards?"
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,Are we getting closer to balance or farther away?
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,What’s your sense?
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"The withdrawal from the Black Sea Grain Initiative does raise concerns about global food security, particularly for poorer countries that import a large share of their food."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"Grain prices did go up on this news, but they remain well below their peaks of last spring."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"And the moves that we’ve seen so far, I would say, are not expected to make a significant contribution to U.S. inflation."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"Of course, we will be watching that situation carefully."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,So you don’t think it would have a big effect on Fed policy at this point?
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,And you’re right.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,You wouldn’t say so looking at what we—what we know now.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks very much.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"So to go, break it down a little further: Of course, headline inflation has come down sharply from elevated levels as energy and food prices have come down, mostly due to [a] reversal of the effects [on those prices that resulted] from the war in Ukraine."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,Doesn’t.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, we will—we’re going to use our policy tools to—working through financial conditions—to get inflation under control The implication is, you know, we will do what it takes to get inflation down, and in principle, that, that could mean that if financial conditions get looser, we have to do more."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"We are watching it, of course, very closely."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"Just wondering, how could that contribute to higher food prices and inflation generally, and how closely are you watching that?"
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think we’ve got a ways to go to get back to balance, really, for the reasons that you talked about."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"With existing homes, you know, there are many people who have low-rate mortgages, and whereas they might want to sell in a normal situation, they’re not going to because they have such, so much, value in their mortgage, whch means that supply of existing homes is really, really tight, which is keeping prices up."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"On the other hand, there’s, you know, there’s a lot of supply coming on line now, and, and there are people coming in."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"A lot of the buyers are, are, you know, first-time buyers coming in, buying at, you know, with these, you know, with these relatively elevated mortgage rates."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,But I think this will take some time to work through.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hopefully, more supply comes on line, and, you know, we, we work through it."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,We’ll go to Nancy for the last question.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Chair Powell."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,Nancy Marshall-Genzer with Marketplace.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"Russia has pulled out of an agreement allowing shipments of grains, safe passage through the Black Sea, and alternative routes at this point could be closed off."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’re still living through the, you know, the aftermath of the—of the pandemic."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s the dollar and equities, but—and, you know, we’re, of course, very focused on rates and our own policy."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,You’re right.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we monitor, of course, financial conditions, broad financial conditions."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks for taking our questions.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,Megan Cassella with Barron’s.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"I wondered on wages if you were at all concerned about any inflationary impact of wages now outpacing inflation, which is likely contributing to the boost in consumer sentiment and the continued strength of the consumer that we’ve been seeing."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"Well, [growth in nominal] wages in excess of inflation means [that increases in] real wages are positive."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"Again, that’s a great thing."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Chair Powell."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"Of course, we want that."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"But we want wages to be going up at a level that’s consistent with, with 2 percent inflation over time."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"As I mentioned, [increases in] nominal wages have been coming down gradually, and that’s what we want to see."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,We expect to see more of that.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s just more of what’s consistent over a longer period of time.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"We don’t really think that, that wages were an important cause of inflation in the first year or so of the outbreak."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,But I would say that wages are probably an important issue going forward.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,We want people to have [gains in] real wages.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"Labor market conditions broadly are going to be an important part of, of getting inflation back down, and that’s why we think we need some further softening in labor market conditions."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,MEGAN CASSELLA.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"That process is ongoing, and that will restrain economic growth."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I think—I think we have to take a step back from “I can’t separate those anymore.” I think—I think, basically, we’re just looking at the overall picture, which is one of tightening credit conditions."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"And that’s, that’s going to restrain economic activity."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,It is restraining economic activity.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,So that’s how I would look at it.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,JENNIFER SCHONBERGER.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,Megan.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,And how is that informing your outlook for setting policy?
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,So I think we—that goes—that’s—an expected result of tightening interest rate policy is that—is that bank credit conditions—bank lending conditions would tighten as well.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"And so the question is, is it more effective this time because of what happened in May?"
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,I just don’t think we know that.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think we’re looking at the current data in GDP, and we’re seeing strong spending."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’re seeing a strong economy, and it’s made us confident that we can go ahead and raise interest rates now for the third time since the March events."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I—it seems like the economy is weathering this well, but, of course, we’re watching it carefully and, and expect to continue to do that."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"They may be tightening a little bit more, probably are, than other banks."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,MEGAN CASSELLA.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"What’s the message there of, of why you continue to keep rates elevated or to raise them?"
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"So may I ask, you know, to what extent was the meeting actually a live one?"
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"Was there ever any doubt over the past two days about what the decision was, was actually going to be?"
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"Well, I mean, you could—“Was there doubt?” Look, I would say there’s a range of views on the Committee, and when you see the minutes in three weeks, you’ll see that."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"There’s a range of views about what we should do at this meeting and what we should do at the next meeting, and it’s a—it’s a process that we go through."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"Many times when we go into a meeting, the decision is not, you know, fundamentally in doubt."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"The decision was, of course, unanimous, and the statement was basically unchanged from last month."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"Nonetheless, we have the meeting, and some—some—some meetings are, you know, less uncertain than others, and I’ll just leave it at that."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,Let’s go to Evan.

2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"This goes sort of to the balance of risks question, but you mentioned at the start how you’re keeping an eye on consumer activity and whether there might be some sort of a rebound there, and I’m curious what the Fed’s explanation would be to families if further interest rate hikes start to hit the labor market—start to, you know, drive that sentiment back down."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"In the event, the market had assigned a, you know, a roughly 99 percent probability to the rate move that you announced today."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,Simon Rabinovitch with the Economist.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"Well, you know, we have a job assigned to us by Congress to get inflation under control."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we think the, the single most important thing we can do to benefit those very families, especially families at the lower end of the income spectrum, is to get inflation sustainably under control and restore price stability."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"We think that is the most important thing we can do now, and we’re determined to do that."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I would just point out that the people who are the most hurt by inflation right away are people who are on a low fixed income, who, you know, when you’re talking about travel or, you know, transportation costs, heating costs, clothing, food, things like that, those—if you’re just making it through each month on your paycheck and prices go up, you’re in trouble right away."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,Even middle-class people have some resources and can absorb inflation.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,You had said last month that this meeting this week was going to be a live one.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"People, people on the lower end of the income spectrum have a harder time doing that."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, the record is clear that if we—if we take too long or if, if we don’t succeed, that the pain will only be greater."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"So that’s, that’s how I would explain what we’re doing."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,Simon.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,SIMON RABINOVITCH.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you, Chair Powell."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,So we need—we need to get this done.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,And we think that’s broadly what we’re—what we’re seeing.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"Clearly, higher rates have, have slowed the housing market."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"So let me start by saying that the inflation surge that we saw in the pandemic resulted from a collision of elevated demand and, and constrained supply, both of which followed from the unprecedented features of the pandemic and the response from fiscal and monetary policy."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s also—you see consumer, consumer confidence coming up and things like that."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s good to see that, of course."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I would say it this way: The overall resilience of the economy, the fact that, that we’ve been able to achieve disinflation so far without any meaningful negative impact on the labor market, the strength of the economy—overall, that’s a good thing."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,Yeah.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,Just how are you thinking about that sort of trajectory?
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I wonder, from your perspective, if that continues, if we see growth not just stabilizing but doing, you know, performing well this summer, is that a problem because it’s inflationary, or is it good news because it suggests that a soft landing is more likely?"
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"It seems like the American consumers are in pretty good shape, and it does seem like growth is sort of picking back up a little bit or at least doing well."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,We’ve seen everyone going to Taylor Swift concerts this summer.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, we’ve seen the Barbie movie numbers."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"Obviously, you updated the language around growth in the statement today."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thanks for taking our questions, Chair Powell."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,JEANNA SMIALEK.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,Jeanna.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,So we’ll be focusing on that.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"I would say it is certainly possible that we would raise funds again at the September meeting if the data warrant it, and I would also say it’s possible that we would choose to hold steady at that meeting."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’re going to be making careful assessments, as I said, meeting by meeting, and I’ll close by saying we’ve raised the federal funds rate now by 525 basis points since March 2022."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"Monetary policy, we believe, is restrictive and is putting downward pressure on economic activity and inflation."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,STEVE LIESMAN.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"If I could just briefly follow up on something you said there: You said the data in the intermeeting period, it probably came in in line with expectations."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,Does that mean there’s unlikely to have been a change in the overwhelming outlook of the Committee that two more hikes are necessary?
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,That will support activity going forward.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"We, we—you know, that’s the question."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"We have eight weeks now until the September meeting, and all that data that I recited, we’re going to be looking at all that and making that assessment then."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"And it really—we did have the one good reading, and, of course, we welcome that."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"But it’s just one reading, as everybody knows."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, and, you know, we’ve seen—we’ve seen this before in the data."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"Many forecasts call for, for rates—for, for inflation to remain low, but we just don’t know that until we see the data."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,I’m just going to go back to what I said.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"But you’re, you’re right, though."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"At the margin, stronger growth could lead, over time, to higher inflation, and that would require an appropriate response for monetary policy."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,So we’ll be watching that carefully and seeing how it evolves over time.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,Nick.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,NICK TIMIRAOS.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"Chair Powell, markets widely believe the median FOMC participant’s inflation forecast from June for the fourth quarter of this year will be too high, given autos and shelter, and that by September, that may warrant a downward revision in the inflation forecast of 20 to 30 basis points."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"Would that type of inflation progress be enough to hold rates steady from here, or do you need to see below-trend growth and decelerating labor income growth to be convinced that you’ve done enough?"
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"So that’s how we look at it, and, and so we did take that step today."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, we’ll be looking at everything."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, we’ll, of course, we’ll be looking to see whether the signal from June’s CPI is replicated or, or the opposite of replicated or whether it’s somewhere in the middle."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,We’ll be looking at the growth data.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’ll be looking at the labor market data very closely, of course, and making an overall judgment about that."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s the totality of the data, I think, but with a particular focus on, on making progress on inflation."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,NICK TIMIRAOS.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"So it’s hard to pick the pieces apart and say, you know, how much of this and how much of that."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,All of that information is going to inform our decision as we go into that meeting.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, growth came in stronger than expected."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"And that’s, you know, a labor market that continues to be strong but, but gradually slowing."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELE SMITH.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,Neil.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,NEIL IRWIN.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thanks, Chair Powell."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,Neil Irwin from Axios.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, as you referenced earlier, in the intermeeting period, soft CPI, jobs reports still strong but moderating, JOLTS look good."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mentioned that the inflation report was actually a little better than expected, but, you know, we’re, we’re going to be careful about taking too much signal from, from a single reading."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"So if you’re data dependent, why not pause again?"
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,Why not take another meeting off when the data was at least cutting in the direction you want to see?
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"So if you go back to what we’re trying to do here, we’re trying to achieve a stance of policy that’s sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation down to 2 percent."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"At the last meeting, we wrote down our individual estimates of that would take—of what that would take, and the median of that was, was an additional two rate hikes."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I would say, we looked at the interim intermeeting data and, as I mentioned, broadly consistent, not perfectly consistent, but broadly consistent with expectations."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, as a result, we went ahead and, and took another step."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,Why not stay on hold?
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,I think we have an ECI report coming later this week—which is [an] employment compensation index—and lots of data on economic activity.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"I will also say, since we’re talking about it, between now and the September meeting, we get two more job reports, two more CPI reports."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"So that’s how we’re thinking about the next meeting and, you know, how we’re thinking about meetings going forward potentially, but, you know, we’re now mainly thinking about the next meeting."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"Over the past three months, job gains averaged 244,000 jobs per month, a pace below that seen earlier in the year but still a strong pace."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,The unemployment rate remains low at 3.6 percent.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,There are some continuing signs that supply and demand in the labor market are coming into better balance.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"The labor force participation rate has moved up since last year, particularly for individuals aged 25 to 54 years."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"Nominal wage growth has shown some signs of easing, and job vacancies have declined so far this year."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"While the jobs-to-workers gap has narrowed, labor demand still substantially exceeds the supply of available workers."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,The labor market remains very tight.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,Inflation remains well above our longer-run goal of 2 percent.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"In June, the 12-month change in the consumer price index, or CPI, came in at 3.0 percent, and the change in the core, core CPI, was 4.8 percent."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,Inflation has moderated somewhat since the middle of last year.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"Nonetheless, the process of getting inflation back down to 2 percent has a long way to go."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"Despite elevated inflation, longer-term inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters, as well as measures from financial markets."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,The Fed’s monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"My colleagues and I are acutely aware that high inflation imposes significant—significant hardship, as it erodes purchasing power, especially for those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"Over the 12 months ending in May, total PCE prices rose 3.8 percent; excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 4.6 percent."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’re highly attentive to the risks that high inflation poses to both sides of our mandate, and we are strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent objective."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,And higher interest rates and slower output growth also appear to be weighing on business fixed investment.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,Growth in consumer spending appears to have slowed from earlier in the year.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we’ve always expected that the disinflationary process would stem from, both from the normalization of those broad pandemic- related supply and demand conditions and from restrictive, restrictive monetary policy, which would help return the balance between supply and demand by restraining demand."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"Transcript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference July 26, 2023 CHAIR POWELL."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,Good afternoon.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,My colleagues and I remain squarely focused on our dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"We understand the hardship that high inflation is causing, and we remain strongly committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,Price stability is the responsibility of the Federal Reserve.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"Although activity in the housing sector has picked up somewhat, it remains well below levels of a year ago, largely reflecting higher mortgage rates."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"Without price stability, the economy doesn’t work for anyone."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"Since early last year, the FOMC has significantly tightened the stance of monetary policy."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"Today we took another step by raising our policy interest rate ¼ percentage point, and we are continuing to reduce our securities holdings at a brisk pace."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’ve covered a lot of ground, and the full effects of our tightening have yet to be felt."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"Looking ahead, we will continue to take a data-dependent approach in determining the extent of additional policy firming that may be appropriate."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,I’ll have more to say about monetary policy after briefly reviewing economic developments.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has been expanding at a moderate pace.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"In particular, without price stability, we will not achieve a sustained period of strong labor market conditions that benefit all."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,If I could follow up: Last month you said there were benefits to moderating the pace of increases because it would give you more information to make decisions.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"At today’s meeting, the Committee raised the target range for the federal funds rate by ¼ percentage point, bringing the target range to 5¼ to 5½ percent."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"With today’s action, we’ve raised our policy rate by 5¼ percentage points since early last year."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,So we haven’t made a decision to go to every other meeting.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s not something we’ve looked at.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’re going to be going meeting by meeting, and as we go into each meeting, we’re going to be asking ourselves the same questions."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we haven’t made any decisions about, about any future meetings, including the pace at which we’d consider hiking."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"And should we also believe that all future meetings—say, September and November— are live, or are you in an every-other-meeting mode?"
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"But we’re going to be assessing the need for further tightening that may be appropriate—you read the language—“to return inflation to 2 percent over time.” I would say that the intermeeting data came in broadly in line with expectations: Economic activity remained resilient, job creation remains strong while cooling a bit, and the June CPI report actually came in a bit better than expectations for a change."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"We hope that inflation will follow a lower path, as was—that will be consistent with the CPI reading, but we don’t know that, and we’re just going to need to see more data."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, what are we going to be looking at?"
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"Really, it will be the broader, the whole broader picture, and starting with—we’re looking for moderate growth, right?"
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’re looking for supply and demand through the economy coming into better balance, including, in particular, in the labor market."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,We’ll be looking at inflation.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’ll be asking ourselves, does this whole collection of data, do we assess it as suggesting that we need to raise rates further?"
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"And the June CPI report, of course, was welcomed, but it’s only one report, one month’s data."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,We are also continuing the process of significantly reducing our securities holdings.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"You have, I think a couple of times in your opening remarks, talked about this language “in determining the extent of additional policy firming that may be appropriate.” Should we take that to mean that additional hikes are likely on the way?"
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,STEVE LIESMAN.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"We have been seeing the effects of our policy tightening on demand in the most interest rate–sensitive sectors of the economy, particularly housing and investment."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"It will take time, however, for the full effects of our ongoing monetary restraint to be realized, especially on inflation."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"In addition, the economy is facing headwinds from tighter credit conditions for households and businesses, which are likely to weigh on economic activity, hiring, and inflation."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"In determining the extent of additional policy firming that may be appropriate to return inflation to 2 percent over time, the Committee will take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial developments."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"We will continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting, based on the totality of the incoming data and their implications for the outlook for economic activity and inflation, as well as the balance of risks."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,We remain committed to bringing inflation back to our 2 percent goal and to keeping longer-term inflation expectations well anchored.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"Mr. Chairman, thank you."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,Reducing inflation is likely to require a period of below-trend growth and some softening of labor market conditions.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"To conclude: We understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,Everything we do is in service to our public mission.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum-employment and price-stability goals.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you, and I look forward to your questions."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,Steve.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,Restoring price stability is essential to set the stage for achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the longer run.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,Would another CPI report like the one we just had in June allow you to at least maintain that slower pace and defer until the fall any decision on whether you need that second rate hike?
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"And if we make that conclusion, then we will go ahead and raise rates."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,So I’m just going to tell you again what we’re going to do.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, in a sense, the clock starts earlier than it—than it used to."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we know that in the modern era, financial conditions move in anticipation of our decisions, and that has clearly been the case in this cycle."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"So there’s a long-running debate about the lags between changes in financial conditions and the response to those changes from economic activity and inflation, right?"
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,Where are you on that continuum?
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, among your colleagues, there have been people who’ve said they feel that very little transmission has taken place so far from monetary policy into the economy, and there are those who feel, they say, it’s happened very fast this time, and it’s kind of up to date."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,Howard Schneider with Reuters.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,HOWARD SCHNEIDER.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,Howard.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,And I think it’ll sort itself out.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think we’re—look, I think we’re going to—we’re going to make a decision about the next meeting, and then we’re going to make a decision about the one after that."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"It could be, you know, longer intervals in between as well?"
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we shouldn’t assume that every other meeting is the lowest tightening frequency, let’s say?"
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,COLBY SMITH.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,Colby Smith with the Financial Times.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"If September is, in fact, a live meeting, how does that square with the need for a more gradual tightening pace that you spoke of last month in explaining the rationale for holding the funds rate steady at the June meeting?"
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,So a more gradual pace doesn’t go immediately to [moving] every other meeting.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"It could be two out of three meetings, right?"
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"It could be—it just means if you’re slowing down, the point really was to slow down the decision cycle as, as we get closer and closer to, we think, our destination."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"But that doesn’t necessarily change the process from that point on, and it’s not clear that it has."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I wouldn’t want to go automatically to [moving] every other meeting, because I just don’t think that’s—we don’t—I think it’s not an environment where we want to provide a lot of forward guidance."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"We just want to keep moving at what we think is the right pace, and I do think it makes all the sense in the world to slow down as we now make these finely judged decisions, and so that’s what we did."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"And so I, I think it’s possible."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,I mentioned it before.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s possible that we would move at consecutive meetings—we’re not taking that off the table—or we might not.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s really going to depend on what the data tell us.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s the best we can do.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,There’s a lot of uncertainty out there.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,We also—this is—I’ll tell you what we know and then what we don’t know.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, by the way, that’s just one component of the broader uncertainty that we face."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,So I’ll tell you how I—how I think about this.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"You’ve got weak demand, and, you know, it, it gives a picture of pretty tight credit conditions in the economy."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think it’s really hard to tease out whether—how much of that is from this source or that source, but I think what matters is, the overall picture is of tight and tightening lending conditions."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"And that’s, that’s what the SLOOS will say."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,Rachel.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,RACHEL SIEGEL.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,You’ve got lending conditions tight and getting a little tighter.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Chair Powell."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks for taking our questions.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"Could you break down the reasons why inflation has fallen and what share of that credit you would give to factors that don’t stem directly from rate hikes or that might be within your control at all, like easing supply chains and a drop in energy prices over the past year?"
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,Yeah.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, interesting question."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,Rachel Siegel from the Washington Post.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I guess that the SLOOS will come out early next week, and I would just say it’s broadly condition—consistent with what you would expect."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"The bank lending data really is—the growth rate’s edging down towards below, heading below zero, which is usually, you know, a recession indicator."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"First, the first thing to say is, we’re determined to bring inflation down to 2 percent over time, and we will use our tools to do that."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,No one should doubt that.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"I would look at it this way, though."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,The real federal funds rate is now in meaningfully positive territory.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"If you take the nominal federal funds rate, subtract the mainstream estimate of near-term inflation expectations, you get a real federal funds rate that is well above most estimates of the longer-term neutral rate."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I would say, monetary policy is restrictive, more so after today’s decision, meaning that it is putting downward pressure on economic activity and inflation."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,We’ll keep monetary policy restrictive until we think it’s not appropriate to do so.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mean, if I sum it up, I would say: We’ve come a long way."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,We are resolutely committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent goal over time.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"Inflation has proved, repeatedly, has proved stronger than we and other forecasts—forecasters have expected, and at some point, that may change."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"We have to be ready to follow the data, and given how far we’ve come, we can afford to be a little patient, as well as resolute, as we let this unfold."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,HOWARD SCHNEIDER.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"On the—on the credit side, I’m wondering if you saw anything in the—in the latest SLOOS data that made you think you’re getting a quantum of credit contraction beyond what you’d expect."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,So that’s how I think about it.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,COLBY SMITH.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"We know that financial conditions affect economic activity and inflation with a lag that can be long and variable, or lags, plural, that can be long and variable—a lot of uncertainty around the length of the lags."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"So you are really—sorry, your question was?"
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"Well, I mean, you’ve talked for many press conferences now about the harm created by inflation, how hard it is for people."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,So how much of that are we still seeing with inflation now down at 3 [percent]?
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,So I guess I would put it this way.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"We, we—I’d say it this way: It’s really a question of, how do you balance the two risks, the risk of doing too much or doing too little?"
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, and I would say that having headline inflation move down that much almost creates a—it will strengthen the broad sense that, that the public has that inflation is coming down, which will in turn, we hope, help inflation continue to move down."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, I would say that, you know, we’re coming to a place where, where there really are risks on both sides."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, you know, we, we need to see that inflation is durably down that far, you know."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"As you know, we think, and most economists think, that core inflation is actually a better signal of, of where headline inflation is going, because headline inflation is affected greatly by volatile energy and food prices."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we would want core inflation to be coming down, because that’s what we think—that’s—core is signaling where headline is going to go in the future."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"And core inflation is still pretty elevated, you know?"
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"There’s reason to think it can come down now, but it’s, it’s still quite elevated, and so we think we need to stay on task, and we think we’re going to need to hold, certainly, hold policy at a restrictive level for some time."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,And we need to be prepared to raise further if that—if we think that’s appropriate.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s hard to say exactly whether, whether they’re in balance or not, but as our—as our stance has become more restrictive and inflation moderates, we do increasingly face that risk."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,CHRISTOPHER RUGABER.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I guess I’d say it this way: First, it is—it is a good thing that headline inflation has come down so much, because that’s really what the public experiences."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"And with that in mind, when do you put some weight back on the employment side of the dual mandate?"
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"In September, we’re going to look at, at two additional job reports, two additional CPI reports, lots of activity data, and that’s what we’re going to look at, and we’re going to make that decision then."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"And that decision could, could mean another hike in, in September, or it could mean that we decide to maintain at that level."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,Colby.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, again, the question we’re going to be asking ourselves is, is the overall signal one that we need to do more, that we need to tighten further?"
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"And if we get that signal, whenever we get it, then—and that’s the collective judgment of the Committee— then we will move ahead."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"If we don’t, you know, then, then we’ll have the option of maintaining policy at that level, but it’s, it’s, you know, it’s really dependent so much on the data, and we just don’t have it yet."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,CHRISTOPHER RUGABER.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,Hi.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,Chris Rugaber at Associated Press.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"So consumer confidence in the economy is rising, likely in large part because of, of the declines in headline inflation."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,You also see wages are also rising faster than prices now after trailing them for a long time.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"How much are Americans truly harmed by inflation at its current level, headline level of 3 percent?"
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,Chris.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"Well, and then if inflation were to—just a quick follow[up]: If it stays at 3 or drops even a little bit more, I mean, how much of an increase in unemployment do you think is acceptable to get that last bit of inflation?"
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,CHRISTOPHER RUGABER.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,And all of that should lead to declining inflationary pressures.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"And if it does tell us that—collectively, if that’s our view—then we will do more."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I’ll just say again, the broader picture of what we want to see is, we want to see easing of supply constraints and normalization of pandemic-related distortions to demand and supply."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,We want to see economic growth running at moderate or modest levels to help ease inflationary pressures.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"We want to see continued restoration of supply and demand balance, particularly in the labor market."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"Now what we see is, we see those pieces of the puzzle coming together."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"People talk about base effects and higher energy costs, and now we have some large labor settlements."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we’re seeing evidence of those things now, but I would—I would say that what, what our eyes are telling us is that policy has not been restrictive long, restrictive enough for long enough to have its full desired effects."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we think the process, you know, still probably has a, a long way to go."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHAEL MCKEE.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"Well, do you think under current conditions you are restrictive enough unless something changes?"
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"People are talking about the potential difficulty of the last, so-called last mile of inflation."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"Well, I think—we think, you know, today’s rate hike was appropriate, and I think we’re going to be looking at the incoming data to inform our decision at the next meeting about, is the incoming data telling us that we need to do more?"
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we intend, again, to keep policy restrictive until we’re confident that inflation is coming down sustainably to our 2 percent target, and we’re prepared to further tighten if that is appropriate."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,Is the economy still moving in a direction where it creates more inflation?
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"Or is the economy disinflating, and you’re just, you’re able to go back to the old Fed policy of opportunistic disinflation?"
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, we hope that that’s as little as possible, but we have to be honest that that is—that is the likely outcome."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"So it is—it is a very positive thing that, actually, the unemployment rate is the same as it was when we lifted off in March of ’22, at 3.6 percent."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"So that’s a real blessing in that we’ve been able to achieve some disinflation, and we don’t seek to it."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s not that we’re aiming to, to raise unemployment, but I would just say, the historical record—we have to be honest about the historical record, which does suggest that when central banks go in and slow the economy to bring down inflation, the result tends to be some softening in labor market conditions."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"And so that is still the, the likely outcome here."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"Do you think you might need to do more, because I’m curious about what you see as inflation dynamics now?"
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"The worst outcome for everyone, of course, would be not to deal with inflation now, not get it done."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"Again, how much unemployment do you think is justified to get down that last one— CHAIR POWELL."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"Whatever the short-term social costs of getting inflation under control, the longer- term social costs of failing to do so are greater, and the historical record is very, very clear on that."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"If you go through a period where inflation expectations are not anchored, inflation is volatile, it interferes with people’s lives and with economic activity, and, you know, that’s the— that’s the thing we, we really need to avoid and will avoid."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,Let’s go to Michael McKee.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHAEL MCKEE.
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"At this point, you say the policy is restrictive, but all year long we have seen growth surprise to the upside, unemployment to the downside, and inflation, lately, to the downside."
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I’m wondering, by definition, should you be restrictive enough right now under these conditions?"
2023-07-26,Press Conf - Full Text,So—but how much?
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Ah.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Okay.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,JENNIFER SCHONBERGER.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,The base factors.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Base factors.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"So on that, we’re, you know, we’re looking at just monthly, right?"
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"In other words, why did you leave that extra dot in?"
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"So you’re right—when you go back 3, 6, and 12 months, you get base factors."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,But we can—we can adjust for that.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"In terms of not getting data—you know, again, we don’t—we don’t comment on government shutdowns."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"It—it’s possible—if, if there is a government shutdown and it lasts through the, the next meeting, then it’s possible we wouldn’t— we wouldn’t be getting some of the data that we would ordinarily get, and we—you know, we would just have to deal with that."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,And I don’t know.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,What was—missed what factors?
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s hard for me to say in advance how that would affect that meeting.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,You can look at just monthly readings and see what the increase was from the prior month.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"Sorry—yeah, I missed the first question."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"Well, I, I think we have come very far very fast in, in the, the rate increases that we’ve made."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,It would depend on all kinds of factors that I don’t know about now.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I think it was important at the beginning that we move quickly, and we did."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, and I think as we get closer to the rate that we think—the stance of monetary policy that we think is appropriate to bring inflation down to 2 percent over time, you know, the risks become more two sided, and the risk of overtightening and the risk of, of undertightening becomes more equal."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"Given the—given the forecast that you have, what justified not moving today, and what could justify moving in the future if you think inflation is coming down?"
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I think the, the natural, commonsense thing to do is, as you approach that, you move a little more slowly as you get closer to it."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"And that, that’s what we’re doing."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we’re, we’re taking advantage of the fact that we have moved quickly to move a little more carefully now as we—as we sort of find our way to, to the right level of restriction that we need to get inflation back down to 2 percent."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Jennifer.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,JENNIFER SCHONBERGER.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you, Chair Powell."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Jennifer Schonberger with Yahoo Finance.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"With your focus on year-over-year PCE, isn’t it true that base effects are huge and that by the time you meet in November, that it’s more likely that you’ll have a low PCE number that would make you feel more comfortable?"
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, secondly, how would the lack of key indicators—like CPI, the jobs report—impact your approach in upcoming meetings if we were to have a government shutdown?"
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"But it’s certainly a reality that, that that’s a possibility."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, and it may have an effect on, on consumer expectations of inflation—things like that."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"Would you feel more comfortable on the base effects that—as those kind of fall out of the equation for the next couple of readings by November, would you feel more comfortable at that point?"
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"So how does that factor into your decision to raise rates or not—because in the last two inflation reports, PCE and CPI, we’ve seen, the overall inflation has actually risen?"
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Right.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, you know, energy prices are very important for the consumer."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"This, this can affect consumer spending."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,It certainly can affect consumer sentiment.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mean, gas prices are one of the big things that, that affects consumer sentiment."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"It, it really comes down to how persistent—how sustained these energy prices are."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"The reason why we look at core inflation, which excludes food and energy, is that energy goes up and down like that."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"And it doesn’t—energy, energy prices mostly, mostly don’t contain much of a signal about how tight the economy is, and hence don’t tell you much about where inflation’s really going."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"However, we’re well aware, though, that, that, you know, if energy prices increase and stay high, that’ll have an effect on spending."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s just things we have to monitor.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,EDWARD LAWRENCE.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHAEL MCKEE.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,On the consumer—they’re putting more and more of this on their credit card.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’re seeing oil prices, as you mentioned, move up, and that’s pushing the price of gas."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,JENNIFER SCHONBERGER.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,So I want to focus back in on oil prices.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thanks for the question, Chair Powell."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, yes."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mean, if you’re looking—if—we, we can tell how much inflation has gone up in a given month, right?"
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, that’s what we’re looking at."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"And month by month, what’s the reading?"
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, I think—I think what we’re really looking at is, there’s a tendency to look at, you know, shorter and shorter maturities, but they’re incredibly volatile, and they can be misleading."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s why we look at 12-month [rates].
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"But I think, in this situation—where it looks like we’ve had a bit of a turn in inflation starting in June—we’re also looking at six months, and even three months, but really six months’ inflation."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,So you’re looking at it over that period and over longer periods.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,That—that’s the right way to go.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we don’t—we don’t need to be in a hurry to—in, in getting to a conclusion about what to do."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,We can let the data evolve.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,So— MICHELLE SMITH.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Edward.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,EDWARD LAWRENCE.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Edward Lawrence with Fox Business.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"But just the nature of the business is, the economy is very difficult to forecast."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"But—I mean, ultimately, you know, you’re, you’re coming into this with an economy that appears to have significant momentum."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,But these are—these are our forecasts.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,All are which—good for the Fed’s longer-run target of low inflation.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"And if we lose that in a recession, aren’t we opting for the awful hysteresis that we had in 2010?"
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,So are you taking this into account as you pursue policy?
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"To begin: A soft landing is a primary objective, and I did not say otherwise."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mean, that’s, that’s what we’ve been trying to achieve for all this time."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"The, the real point, though, is—the, the worst thing we can do is to fail to restore price stability, because the record is clear on that: If you, you don’t restore price stability, inflation comes back, and you go through—you can have a long period where the economy’s just very uncertain, and it will affect growth; it will affect all kinds of things."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,It can be a miserable period to have inflation constantly coming back and the Fed coming in and having to tighten again and again.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"So the best thing we can do for everyone, we believe, is to restore price stability."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think now, today, we actually—you know, we, we have the ability to be careful at this point and move carefully, and that’s what we’re planning to do."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we fully appreciate that—you know, the benefits of being able to continue what we see already, which is rebalancing in the labor market and inflation coming down without seeing, you know, an important, large increase in unemployment, which has been typical of other tightening cycles."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,So— MICHELLE SMITH.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Let’s go to Chris.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,CHRISTOPHER RUGABER.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"And since inflation’s coming down with strong GDP growth, we may have higher productivity."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Hi.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,We’ve had a decent spate of homebuilding.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Workers want to work.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"The consumer is seeing, you know, record credit spending."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,We tend to look through short-term volatility and look at—look at core inflation.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"But so the question is, how long are, are higher prices sustained?"
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,We have to—we have to take those macroeconomic effects into account as well.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Those are—those are some of them.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,I’m not sure if I hit them all.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"And that’s, that’s what we start with."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,And we—but we do have this collection of risks that you mentioned.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Craig.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,CRAIG TORRES.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Craig Torres from Bloomberg News.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"I was a little surprised, Chair Powell, to hear you say that a soft landing is not a primary objective."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,This economy’s seeing added supply in a way that could create long-term inflation stability.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,We have prime-age labor force participation moving up where people can add skills.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,We have a boom in manufacturing construction.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, they’re, they’re—we have very high-quality people working on these forecasts, and I think they stand up well against other forecasters."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"When you look at the disinflation that has taken place so far, do you see it mostly as a result of what some economists are calling “the low-hanging fruit”—such as the unwinding of supply chain snarls and other pandemic disruptions—or is it more a broad disinflationary trend that involves most goods and services across the economy?"
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"Well, forecasts are highly uncertain."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Forecasting is very difficult.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Forecasters are a humble lot with much to be humble about.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"But to get to, to your question, though—what’s happened is, growth has come in stronger, right?"
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Stronger than expected—and that’s required higher rates.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"Unemployment, you know—you also see that the, the ultimate unemployment rate is not as high, but that—that’s really because of what we’ve been seeing in the labor market."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,We’ve seen more and more progress in the labor market without seeing significantly higher unemployment.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we’re, we’re continuing that trend."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"In terms of inflation, you, you are seeing—the last three readings are, are very good readings."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s only three readings, you know."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,We—we’re well aware that we need to see more than three readings.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"But if you look at June, July, and August, you’re looking at, you know, really significant declines in core inflation, largely in the goods sector—also to some extent in housing services and just a little in nonhousing services."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Those are the three buckets.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"Headline inflation, of course, has come way down, largely due to lower energy prices, some of which is now reversing."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I think—people should know that, that economic forecasting is very difficult, and these are highly uncertain forecasts."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Chris Rugaber at Associated Press.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"And given all the known unknowns that you face, how much confidence do you have, can investors have, or the American people have in your forecasts?"
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,You lowered your unemployment forecast significantly.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"So if I—if I understood your question, it’s—I would say it this way: I think we knew from the time—from before when we lifted off, but certainly by the time we lift—we knew that bringing inflation back down was going to take, as I call it, the unwinding of these distortions to both supply and demand that happened because of the pandemic and the response."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,So that unwinding was going to be important.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"In addition, monetary policy was going to help."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"It was going to help supply side heal by, by cooling demand off and, just in general, better aligning supply with demand."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,So those two forces were always going to be important.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,I think it’s very hard to pull them apart.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,They work together.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"I, I do think both of them are at work now, and I think they’re at work in a way that shows you the progress that we—that we are seeing."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Let’s go to Mike.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHAEL MCKEE.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Michael McKee from Bloomberg Television and Radio.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"In June, you forecast a 5.6 percent year-end median fed funds rate, and since then, you’ve more than doubled your growth forecast."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, what would justify that last move, because the median forecast is for lower inflation?"
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,How long do you think the consumer can manage that debt at higher interest rates now?
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I, I think, overall, households are in good shape."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,It could also just be that policy hasn’t been restrictive enough for long enough.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,And it’s—there are many candidate explanations.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"We have to, in, in all this uncertainty, make policy, and I, you know, I feel like what we have right now is what’s still a very strong labor market—but that’s coming back into balance."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,We were making progress on inflation.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Growth is strong.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"But I think by many forecasts—many, many, many forecasts call for growth to, to moderate over the course of the next year."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"So that’s where we are, and, you know, we have to—we have to deal with what comes."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"On your second question, which was— sorry, your second question was distributional, but can you—can you be a little clearer about that?"
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,SIMON RABINOVITCH.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Yeah.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"My point there was that if you’re somebody who has a long fixed-rate mortgage, you’ve been able to endure the higher rates relatively easily."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"If you’re somebody who’s living month to month off of your credit card, current financing rates are, are punitive."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Yes.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,And so the point I would make there is that we’re trying to get inflation back down.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,We don’t know that.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,The people who are most hurt by inflation are the people who are on a fixed income.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"It could also be that for other reasons, the neutral rate of interest is, is higher for—for various reasons."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,The question is whether that’s sustainable.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,SIMON RABINOVITCH.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you, Chair Powell."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Simon Rabinovitch with the Economist.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,One of the factors in the economic resilience to date appears to be a lesser degree of rate sensitivity than in the past.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"Obviously, we’ve talked about households with long fixed-rate mortgages—also companies that refinanced before last year."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,What is your thinking about the efficacy of rates and how that’s changed?
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"And then, related to that, how do you think about the distributional consequences in the sense that if you’re a relatively wealthy household with a long fixed-rate mortgage, the past year has not been all that tough with rates going up, whereas if you’re relying on your credit card for supporting your consumption, in fact, times are getting a lot tougher a lot more quickly?"
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, what—I guess it’s fair—it’s fair to say that the economy has been stronger than many expected, given, given what’s been happening with, with interest rates."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Why is that?
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Many candidate explanations—possibly—a number of them make sense.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"One, one is just that household balance sheets and business balance sheets have been stronger than we had understood, and so that, that spending has held up—and that kind of thing."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,We’re not sure about that.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,The savings rate for consumers has come down a lot.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"That could—it could just mean that the—that the date of effect is, is later."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Simon.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"If you’re a person who spends all of your income, you don’t really have any meaningful savings."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"So it is for those people as much as for anybody that we need to restore price stability, and, and we, we want to do it as quickly as possible."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I, I don’t know about the quarterly survey."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s an idea we can—we can take away and think about.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"In terms of how low and moderate Americans—you know, they’re clearly—were suffering from, from high inflation."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think during the pandemic, the, the government transfers that happened were very meaningful."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, if you know the—the surveys that we take showed that—showed that low- and moderate-income people were actually in very, very strong financial condition."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think now it’s a very “hot” labor market, and you’re seeing high [growth in] nominal wages, and you’re starting to see [that growth rates of] real wages are now positive by most—by most measures."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Surveys are a different thing.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"So surveys are showing dissatisfaction, and I think a lot of that is just, people hate inflation—hate it."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"And that, that causes people to say, “The economy’s terrible.” But, at the same time, they’re spending money."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"Their behavior is, is not exactly what you would expect from the surveys."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"That’s kind of a, a guess at what the answer might be."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"But I, I think there’s a lot of good things happening on household balance sheets—and, certainly, in the labor market and with wages."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"The biggest wage increases having gone to relatively low- wage jobs—and now [with] inflation coming down—you’re seeing [increases in] real wages, which is a good thing."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks very much.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,A sustained period of higher—of higher energy prices can affect consumer expectations about inflation.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"You spend all your income on the basics of life—clothing, food, transportation, heating—the basics—and prices go up by 5, 6, 7 percent, you’re in trouble right away, whereas even, even middle-class people have some savings and some ability to absorb that."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"Is there this thing where, like, the GDP is strong because of wealthy Americans kind of driving things?"
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"Obviously, we—we’d like to do that."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’d like the current trend to continue, which is that we’re making progress without seeing the kind of increase in unemployment that we’ve seen past—in past things."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"But you’re right, though."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"When we raise rates, people who are, you know, living on credit cards and, and borrowing are going to feel that more."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,They are.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, of course, people with, with lots of savings also have a—have a much lower marginal propensity to consume, and so they’re not going to—it’s not going to affect them as much."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Let’s go to Greg Robb for the last question.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,GREG ROBB.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you, Chair Powell."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Greg Robb from MarketWatch.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"In the Beige Book recently, you can tell that the Fed has been surveying nonprofits and community groups about the economic health of low-income Americans—moderate-income Americans."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,I have two questions about this.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Are you going to use that data to maybe come up with sort of like a quarterly survey of those groups—like the senior loan officer survey?
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"And from your—and also the second question is, from your recent look—readings of these surveys, how are low and moderate Americans doing?"
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,I just want to get your sense of the health of that sector.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"And are you concerned about a, a debt bubble related to that?"
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mean, concern number one is, is restoring price stability, because in the long run, that’s, that’s something we have to do so that we can have the kind of economy we really want, which is one with sustained period of tight labor market conditions that benefit all, as I—as I’ve said a couple times."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"Of course, everyone’s got models that’ll give you a very precise answer, but they give you different answers."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"So—but, essentially, they’re, they’re moving up because—it’s not because of inflation."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s because probably—it’ll probably have something to do with stronger growth, I would say—more, more supply of Treasuries."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, the common explanations that you hear in the markets kind of make sense."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Kyle.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,KYLE CAMPBELL.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"Kyle Campbell, American Banker."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you for taking the questions—just two on, on housing."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"You’ve said slower shelter cost growth is in the pipeline and will reflect in inflation readings as new leases are signed, but there’s also some questions out there about the way housing costs are measured, particularly the use of rental equivalents, which are estimates from homeowners about what their homes would rent for if they were in the rental market."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"So my question is, how much of the effort to tame inflation, both as it’s measured and felt by the broader public, hinges on housing supply?"
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"And then as far as a constrained housing supply being sort of exacerbated by this sort of lock-in effect of mortgages being higher now than they were at their recent historic lows, how is that going to impact future thinking about taking interest rates to that lower bound in the future?"
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"So on the supply point—of course, supply is very important over time in, in setting house prices and, and, for that matter, rents."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,And so—and supply is kind of structurally constrained.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s mostly about other things, you know—either term premium or real yields— and it’s, it’s hard to be precise about this."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"But in terms of, of where inflation’s going in the near term, though, as, as you obviously know, a lot of it is, is leases that are running off and then being re-signed or re- leased at a level that’s, that’s not as—it won’t be that much higher."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think it’s always hard to say precisely, but it’s—most, most people do a common decomposition of the increase, and they’ll, they’ll—the view will be, it’s not—it’s not mostly about inflation expectations."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,So you’re right.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, to, to finish my prior thought, I was saying that’s why we tend to look through energy moves that we—that we can see as, as short-term volatility."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, turning to consumer credit, you know—of course, we watch that carefully."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"Consumer distress— measures of distress among consumers were at historic lows quite recently, you know, after— during and after the, the pandemic."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,They’re now moving back up to normal.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’re, we’re watching that carefully."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, at this point, these, these readings are not at troublingly high levels."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"They’re, they’re just kind of moving back up to what was the typical [level] in the pre-pandemic era."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Jean.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,JEAN YUNG.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Hi.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Jean Yung with MNI Market News.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Yields along the Treasury curve have risen to their highest in years.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"What is the Fed’s view about what’s been driving that increase in recent weeks, and how much of it can be attributed to macro explanations—and how much to technical factors?"
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, rates have moved up significantly."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"So that, that said—of course, you know—we, we also now, given how far we’ve come with our rate hikes and how quickly we’ve come here, we do have the ability to be careful as we move forward because of that consideration."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"A year ago, it would have been much higher than it was a year before; now it may be below or at the same level."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Your second question was the lock-ins.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"At this point, would the Fed welcome a decrease in consumer spending?"
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Would that help you get inflation closer to your 2 percent target?
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"I, I wouldn’t say it that way."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,We’re not looking for a decrease in consumer spending.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s, it’s a good thing that the economy’s strong."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s a good thing that the economy has been able to hold up under, under the tightening that we’ve done."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s a good thing that the labor market’s strong.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"The, the only concern—it, it just means this: If the economy comes in stronger than expected, that just means we’ll have to do more in terms of monetary policy to get back to 2 percent—because we will get back to 2 percent."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Does that answer your question?
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Yeah.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I guess, on the other hand, would you worry that that could contribute to an economic slowdown or even a recession?"
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"Well, that’s always a concern."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"Chair Powell, you’ve mentioned several things that would possibly weigh on consumer confidence, maybe cut back consumer spending—possible government shutdown, high gas prices."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"So as those leases are rolling over, we’re, we’re seeing what we expect, which is measured housing services inflation coming down."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Nancy Marshall-Genzer with Marketplace.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"How much is that affecting things, really?"
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,KYLE CAMPBELL.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"Is that going to affect your decisions to potentially bring rates down to their lower bound in the future, sort of creating that sort of bubble of buying and then a lock-in that sort of stagnates the housing market?"
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"I, I think we look at the—I would look at the lock-in, the, the idea being that people are in, in very low mortgage—very low-rate mortgages, and if—even if they want to move now, they—it would be hard because the new mortgage would be so expensive."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,And that’s explaining some of the—that’s one of the explanations for what’s happening broadly in the labor market.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"Would that play a role in, in our future decisions—in a—in a future tight— in a future loosening cycle about whether we would cut rates?"
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"No, I, I don’t think it would."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mean, I don’t think that’s—I, I think we’d be looking at, what, you know, fundamentally, what, what rates does the economy need?"
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, and, you know, in, in an emergency like the pandemic or during the Global Financial Crisis, you, you know, the, the—you have to cut rates to the point that—you have to do, do what you can to support the economy."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,So I wouldn’t—I wouldn’t think that that would be a reason for us not to do that.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s not something we’re thinking about at all right now.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, down the road, I wouldn’t think so."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Nancy.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Hi.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,It can affect the consumer over time.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"Over the past three months, payroll job gains averaged 150,000 jobs per month, a strong pace that is nevertheless well below that seen earlier in the year."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, energy prices being higher—that’s—that is a significant thing."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,RACHEL SIEGEL.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Chair Powell."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Rachel Siegel from the Washington Post.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks for taking our questions.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,How would you characterize the debate around another hike or holding steady?
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"Is it discussion around lag times, fear of too much slowing, too little slowing?"
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Could you walk us through what this disagreement was about at the meeting?
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Yeah.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"So the proposal at the meeting was to—was to maintain our current policy stance, and, and I think there was obviously unanimous support for that."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"But this, of course, is an SEP meeting, and so people write down what they think."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"And you’ve got—you have some—you saw, I think—seven wrote down no hike at this—at this meeting—or between now and the end of the year."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,And I think 12 wrote down another single hike in one of the next two meetings that we have between the end of the year.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"So it wasn’t like we were arguing over that—people just stating their positions—and, really, what, what people are saying is, “Let’s see how the data come in.” You know, we, we want to see—you know what we want to see."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"We want to see that, that this, this—these good inflation readings that we’ve been seeing for the last three months—we want to see that it’s more than just three months, right?"
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Let’s go to Rachel.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"We want to see, you know—the, the labor market report that we received, the last one that we received, was a good example of what we do—of what we do want to see."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"But what it reflects, though, is that economic activity’s been stronger than we expected—stronger than I think everyone expected."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"We want to see convincing evidence, really, that we have reached the appropriate level, and then, you know, we’re— we’ve—we’ve seen progress, and, and we welcome that."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, you know, we need to see more progress before we’ll be willing to—to reach that conclusion."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,COLBY SMITH.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,And just on the 2024 projections—what’s behind that shallower path for interest rate cuts and the need for real rates to be 50 basis points higher?
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Right.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I would say it this way: First of all, interest rates—real interest rates are, are positive now."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"They’re meaningfully positive, and that’s a good thing."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,We need policy to be restrictive so that we can get inflation down to target.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Okay.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,And we need— we’re going to need that to remain to be the case for some time.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I think, you know— remember that the—of course, the SEP is not a plan that is negotiated or discussed, really, as a plan."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s a cumulation, really, and what you see are the medians."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s a cumulation of individual forecasts from 19 people, and then what you’re seeing are the medians."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I wouldn’t want to, you know, bestow upon it the idea that, that it’s really a plan."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, and so what you’re—what you’re seeing is, this is what people believe, as of now, will be appropriate to achieve what we’re looking to achieve, which is progress toward our—toward our inflation goal, as you see in the SEP. MICHELLE SMITH."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’re not saying—yeah, no, no—clearly, we’re just—what we decided to do is maintain a policy rate and await further data."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"It was a combination of, of, you know, of—across a broad range of indicators, continuing rebalancing of the labor market."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"But I think people—they want to be convinced, you know—they want to be careful to—not to jump to a conclusion, really, one way or the other—but just be convinced that the data, you know, support that conclusion."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"And now that we’re getting closer, we, we— again, we have the ability to proceed carefully."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Let’s go to Steve.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,STEVE LIESMAN.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"Steve Liesman, CNBC."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"Mr. Chairman, I want to return to Colby’s question here."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,What is it saying about the Committee’s view of the inflation dynamic in the economy that you achieve the same forecast inflation rate for next year but need another half a point of the funds rate on it?
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"Does it tell you that—does it tell us that the Committee believes inflation to be more persistent—requires more medicine, effectively?"
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I guess a related question is, if you’re going to project a funds rate above the longer-run rate for four years in a row, at what point do we start to think, “Hey, maybe the longer rate or the neutral rate is actually higher”?"
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I, I guess I would point more to—rather than pointing to a sense of inflation having become more persistent, I wouldn’t think—that’s not—we’ve, we’ve seen inflation be more persistent over the course of the past year, but I wouldn’t say that’s something that’s appeared in the recent data."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s more about stronger economic activity, I would say."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"So if, if I had to attribute one thing—again, we’re, we’re picking medians here and trying to attribute one explanation."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,I think that was appropriate.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"So those are the two things—so those are our two mandate variables, and, and that’s, that’s the progress that we want to see."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"As we’ve gotten closer to it, we’ve slowed the pace at which we’ve moved."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"Nonetheless, you know, we need—we need to get to a place where we’re confident that we have a stance that will bring inflation down to 2 percent over time."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"And that’s why, given how far we’ve come and how quickly we’ve come, we’re actually in a position to be able to proceed carefully as we assess the incoming data and the evolving outlooks and risks and make these decisions meeting by meeting."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,RACHEL SIEGEL.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,I see.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, in your view, what would—I know nothing has been decided yet—but what would one more hike at the end of the year do to the economy or to inflation?"
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"And on the other side, what would no hike do, if you could sort of game that out for us?"
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, you know, you, you can make the argument that one hike one way or the other won’t matter."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, for us, we’re, we’re trying—obviously, as a group, it’s a pretty tight cluster of, of where we think that, that policy stance might be, but we’re always going to be learning from data."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, we’ve learned all through the course of the last year that, actually, we needed to go further than we had thought."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"If you go back a year—and what we thought, what we wrote down—it’s actually gotten higher and higher."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we, we don’t really know until—and that’s why, again, we—we’re in a position to proceed carefully at this point."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"A year ago, we proceeded pretty quickly to get rates up."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"Now—now we’re fairly close, we think, to where we need to get."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s, it’s just a question of reaching the right stance."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"I wouldn’t attribute huge importance to one hike in, in macroeconomic terms."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"That’s what we need to get to, and we’ve been—you know, we’ve been moving toward it."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"But I think, broadly, stronger economic activity means, means rates— we have to do more with rates, and that’s what—that’s what that meaning is, is telling you."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,COLBY SMITH.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"Participants expect growth to cool, with the median projection falling to 1.5 percent next year."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"The labor market remains tight, but supply and demand conditions continue to come into better balance."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,The unemployment rate ticked up in August but remains low at 3.8 percent.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"The labor force participation rate has moved up since late last year, particularly for individuals aged 25 to 54 years."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"Nominal wage growth has shown some signs of easing, and job vacancies have declined so far this year."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"Although the jobs-to-workers gap has narrowed, labor demand still exceeds the supply of available workers."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"FOMC participants expect the rebalancing in the labor market to continue, easing upward pressures on inflation."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,The median unemployment rate projection in the SEP rises from 3.8 percent at the end of this year to 4.1 percent over the next two years.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Inflation remains well above our longer-run goal of 2 percent.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"Based on the consumer price index, or CPI, and other data, we estimate that total PCE prices rose 3.4 percent over the 12 months ending in August and that, excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 3.9 percent."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"Inflation has moderated somewhat since the middle of last year, and longer-term inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters, as well as measures from financial markets."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"Nevertheless, the progress—process of getting inflation sustainably down to 2 percent has a long way to go."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"The median projection in the SEP for total PCE inflation is 3.3 percent this year, falls to 2.5 percent next year, and reaches 2 percent in 2026."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,The Fed’s monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"My colleagues and I are acutely aware that high inflation imposes significant hardship, as it erodes purchasing power, especially for those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"In our Summary of Economic Projections, or SEP, Committee participants revised up their assessments of real GDP growth, with the median for this year now at 2.1 percent."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"We are highly attentive to the risks that high inflation poses to both sides of our mandate, and we’re strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent objective."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Higher interest rates also appear to be weighing on business fixed investment.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Recent readings on consumer spending have been particularly robust.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"Transcript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference September 20, 2023 CHAIR POWELL."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"Good afternoon, everyone."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,My colleagues and I remain squarely focused on our dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"We understand the hardship that high inflation is causing, and we remain strongly committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Price stability is the responsibility of the Federal Reserve.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,We—energy prices being up can affect spending.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"In particular, without price stability, we will not achieve a sustained period of strong labor market conditions that benefit all."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"Since early last year, the FOMC has significantly tightened the stance of monetary policy."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,We’ve raised our policy interest rate by 5¼ percentage points and have continued to reduce our securities holdings at a brisk pace.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’ve covered a lot of ground, and the full effects of our tightening have yet to be felt."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"Today, we decided to leave our policy interest rate unchanged and to continue to reduce our securities holdings."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"Looking ahead, we’re in a position to proceed carefully in determining the extent of additional policy firming that may be appropriate."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Our decisions will be based on our ongoing assessments of the incoming data and the evolving outlook and risks.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,I will have more to say about monetary policy after briefly reviewing economic developments.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has been expanding at a solid pace, and, so far this year, growth in real GDP has come in above expectations."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"Activity in the housing sector has picked up somewhat, though it remains well below levels of a year ago, largely reflecting higher mortgage rates."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, right now, it’s still an open question about “sufficiently restrictive”—you’re not saying today that we’ve reached this level?"
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"As I noted earlier, since early last year, we have raised our policy rate by 5¼ percentage points."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"In addition, the economy is facing headwinds from tighter credit conditions for households and businesses."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Colby.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,COLBY SMITH.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Colby Smith with the Financial Times.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"What makes the Committee inclined to think that the fed funds rate at this level is not yet sufficiently restrictive, especially when officials are forecasting a slightly more benign inflation outlook for this year?"
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,There’s noted uncertainty about policy lags.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"Headwinds have emerged from the looming government shutdown, the end of federal childcare funding, resumption of student debt payments—things of that nature."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I guess I would characterize the, the situation a little bit differently."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,So we decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate where it is—at 5¼ to 5½ percent—while continuing to reduce our securities holdings.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,And we say we’re committed to achieving and sustaining a stance of monetary policy that’s sufficiently restrictive to bring down inflation to 2 percent over time—we said that.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,But the fact that we decided to maintain the policy rate at this meeting doesn’t mean that we’ve decided that we have or have not at this time reached that—that stance of monetary policy that we’re seeking.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"If you looked at the SEP, as you—as you obviously will have done, you will see that a majority of participants believe that it is more likely than not that we will—that it will be appropriate for us to raise rates one more time in the two remaining meetings this year."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Others believe that we have already reached that.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"So it’s, it’s something where we’re—by, by—we’re not making a decision by, by deciding to—about that question by deciding to just maintain the rate and await further data."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"We see the current stance of monetary policy as restrictive, putting downward pressure on economic activity, hiring, and inflation."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you, and I look forward to your questions."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Everything we do is in service to our public mission.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"In light of how far we have come in tightening policy, the Committee decided at today’s meeting to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 5¼ to 5½ percent and to continue the process of significantly reducing our securities holdings."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,We are committed to achieving and sustaining a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation down to our 2 percent goal over time.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"In our SEP, FOMC participants wrote down their individual assessments of an appropriate path for the federal funds rate, based on what each participant judges to be the most likely—sorry—the most likely scenario going forward."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"If the economy evolves as projected, the median participant projects that the appropriate level of the federal funds rate will be 5.6 percent at the end of this year, 5.1 percent at the end of 2024, and 3.9 percent at the end of 2025."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"Compared with our June Summary of Economic Projections, the median projection is unrevised for the end of this year but has moved up by ½ percentage point at the end of the next two years."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"These projections, of course, are not a Committee decision or plan; if the economy does not evolve as projected, the path of policy will adjust as appropriate to foster our maximum-employment and price-stability goals."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"We will continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting, based on the totality of the incoming data and their implications for the outlook for economic activity and inflation, as well as the balance of risks."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"Given how far we have come, we are in a position to proceed carefully as we assess the incoming data and the evolving outlook and risks."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"Real interest rates now are well above mainstream estimates of the neutral policy rate, but we are mindful of the inherent uncertainties in precisely gauging the stance of policy."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’re prepared to raise rates further if appropriate, and we intend to hold policy at a restrictive level until we’re confident that inflation is moving down sustainably toward our objective."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"In determining the extent of additional policy firming that may be appropriate to return inflation to 2 percent over time, the Committee will take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial developments."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,We remain committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal and to keeping longer-term inflation expectations well anchored.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Reducing inflation is likely to require a period of below-trend growth and some softening of labor market conditions.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Restoring price stability is essential to set the stage for achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the longer run.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"To conclude: We understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum-employment and price-stability goals.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"In terms of, of what the neutral rate can be—you know, we—we know it by its works."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"Without price stability, the economy does not work for anyone."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"We can’t—we can’t—you know, the, the models and, and—that we use, you—ultimately, you only know when you get there and by, by the way the economy reacts."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Neil.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,NEIL IRWIN.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thanks so much, Chair Powell."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Neil Irwin with Axios.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"I wonder—how do you think about the question of whether the strong GDP growth we’ve been seeing is driven by excess demand versus supply-side factors, productivity, labor force growth?"
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, relatedly, if GDP keeps coming in “hot,” even in the absence of inflation resurgence, would that on its own be a reason to consider more tightening?"
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"So on, on your first question—I mean, we’re looking at GDP very, very carefully to try to understand really what’s the direction of it—what’s, what’s driving it."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"And it’s, it’s a lot of consumer spending, you know."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s been—the consumer’s been very robust in its—in spending.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"So that is, you know, that’s how we’re looking at it."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"Sorry, your second question was— NEIL IRWIN."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"Does GDP stays “hot,” but without inflation?"
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s—this is—these are estimates made a year in advance that are highly uncertain, and that’s how it is."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I, I think the question will be—GDP is not our mandate, right?"
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"No one will look back at this and say, “Hey, we made a plan.” It’s not like that at all."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, there’s—you know, there’s so much uncertainty around that."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,JEANNA SMIALEK.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thanks, Chair Powell."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"Following up on Nick’s question, actually—John Williams, the New York Fed president, obviously, has said things to the effect of, “Next year, as we see inflation kind of”—again, to Nick’s point—“as, as we see inflation coming down, we’re going to need to reduce interest rates to make sure that we’re not squeezing the economy harder and harder over time.” And I wonder if that’s basically the logic that you apply—you know, is that how you think about it?"
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"And then I also wonder—in the last press conference, you said something to the effect of, you know, “It’s a full year out—those discussions,” and people interpreted that to mean that you didn’t see a possibility of a rate cut in the first half of next year."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I wonder if that was what you meant by that or whether, you know—how you’re thinking about that timing."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,No.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"When—so when I answer these questions about hypotheticals about, about cutting, I’m never intending to send a signal about timing; I’m just answering them as, as the question is expressed."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, so please—I, I wouldn’t want to be taken that way."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"Sorry— the first question was, is that how?"
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"Yeah, so we’re—as we go into next year, that’s the question we’ll be asking is—you know, taking into account lags and, and everything else we know about the economy and everything we know about monetary policy, the, the time will come at some point, and I’m not saying when, that it’s—that it’s appropriate to cut."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Part of that may be that real rates are rising because inflation is coming down.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Part of it just may be that—it’ll be all the factors that we see in the economy.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, that time will certainly come at some point."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"And you—what you see is us writing down, you know, a year ahead, estimates of what that might be."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"In, in— when we—in the moment, we’ll do what we think makes sense."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Jeanna.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Maximum employment and price stability are the mandates.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s going to be the question.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mean, to, to start with the strike—first of all, we absolutely don’t comment on the strike, as we have no view on the strike one way or the other."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"But we, we do have to make an assessment of its economic effects to do our jobs."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, you know, the, the thing about it is—so uncertain."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,It will depend.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"The economic effects—it could affect—you’ve looked—we’ve looked back at history—it could affect economic output, hiring, and inflation."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,But that’s really going to depend on how broad it is and how long it’s sustained for.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we—and then it also depends on how quickly production can make up for, for lost production."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,So none of those things are known right now.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s very, very hard to know."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,So you just have to leave that uncertain.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, and we’ll be learning, I think, over the course of the next intermeeting period, much more about that."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"We, we—I don’t know if you mentioned shutdown; I think of all of these as being on the list."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,We don’t comment on that.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,It hasn’t traditionally had much of a macroeconomic effect.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"We only know it by its works, really."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, ultimately, though, there’s so much uncertainty around, around these things."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"The question will be, is, is the level—is GDP—is the—is the heat that we see in GDP—is it really a threat to our ability to get back to 2 percent inflation?"
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know—so, what we try to do is assess all of them and, and handicap all of them."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"But it— you know, it’s, it’s the strike, it’s government shutdown, resumption of student loan payments, higher long-term rates, oil price shock."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s not—it’s not a question about GDP on its own.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s, you—you know, you’re expecting to see the—this improvement, you know—continued rebalancing in the labor market and inflation moving back down to 2 percent in a sustainable way."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"We have to have confidence in that, and, you know, we’d be—we’d be looking at GDP just, just to the extent that it threatens one or both of those."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Victoria.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,VICTORIA GUIDA.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Hi.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Victoria Guido with Politico.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,There are multiple external factors that are playing out right now.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,We see rising oil prices.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,We see auto workers striking.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"There’s the looming, very real possibility of a government shutdown."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I was just wondering, for each of those things, could you talk about how you’re thinking about how that might affect the course for the Fed and the economy?"
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"So there is a—there is a long list, and you hit some of them."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, you could—there are a lot of things that you can—you can look at."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,And the same is true for the others.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’ll make—we take all of that into account, so I can’t really answer a hypothetical about one piece of that."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,So all of those things are happening.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"You’re right—in, in the median forecast, we don’t see a big increase in unemployment."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"We do see an increase, and—but that’s—that really is just “playing forward” the trends that we’ve been seeing."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,That is not guaranteed.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"There, there may come a time when unemployment goes up more than that, but that’s, that’s really what we’ve been seeing is, progress without higher unemployment for now."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,HOWARD SCHNEIDER.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s a way for supply—that’s a way for the labor market to achieve a better balance.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"So just to, to boil that down for a second—you know, we’ve gone from a very narrow path to a—to a soft landing to something different."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"No, no—I would not do that."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"I, I would just say—what, what would I say about that?"
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"I’ve always thought that the soft landing was, was a plausible outcome—that there was a path, really, to, to a soft landing."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"I’ve thought that, and I’ve said that since we lifted off."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s also possible that, that the path has narrowed, and it’s widened, apparently."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Would you call the soft landing now a baseline expectation?
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"Also, remember, the natural rate, we think, is, is coming down, which is a supply-side thing, so that the, the gap between any given unemployment rate that’s lower than that and the natural rate comes down."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"I would say, though, we still—I still think, and I think, broadly, people still think, that there will have to be some softening in the labor market that can come through more supply, as we’ve seen as well."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"You’re also seeing supply-side things—so, so that’s happening."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’ll—it’ll be trying to reach a judgment over whether we should move forward with another rate hike overall and whether that would increase our confidence that, that, yes, this is an appropriate move, and it will help, help us be more confident that we’ve gotten to the level that we need to get to."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"So it, it may—it may, of course, be that the—that the neutral rate has risen."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Remember—what we write down in the SEP is the longer-run rate.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"It is certainly possible that, you know, that the—that the neutral rate at this moment is higher than that, and that—that’s part of the explanation for why the economy has been more resilient than, than expected."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Let’s go to Howard.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,HOWARD SCHNEIDER.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Howard Schneider with Reuters.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,So you’ve said several times that the economy needed a period of below-trend growth to get inflation consistently back to 2 percent.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,You kind of get that in 2024 a little bit—1.5 percent is just a touch below what’s the estimate of potential.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"So the fact that you’re getting so much done at so much less cost, does that represent a change in how you think inflation works, a change in how you think the economy works, a change in the mix of supply healing versus demand destruction that’s necessary to achieve this?"
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"Yes, of course."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"It is a—it is a good thing that we, we’ve seen now meaningful rebalancing in the labor market without an increase in unemployment, and that’s, that’s because we’re seeing that rebalancing in other places—in, for example, job openings and in the jobs–worker gap."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"Ultimately, it—this may be decided by factors that are outside our control at the end of the day."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,But I do think it’s—I do think it’s possible.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"You do see people—you don’t see the median moving—but you do see people raising their estimates of, of the neutral rate, and it’s certainly plausible that the neutral rate is higher than, than the longer-run rate."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"That—we, we will restore price stability."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"You’re seeing, you know, inflation coming down."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s principally now in goods—also in housing services.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,You begin to see effects of it in nonhousing services as well.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,So I think—we think that that is working.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I, I think, you know—as we’ve said, we, we want to reach that—we want to reach something that we’re confident gets us to that level."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I think confidence comes from seeing, you know, enough data that you feel like, “Yes, okay, this feels like it—we can—we can, for now, decide that this is the right level and just agree to stay here.” We’re not permanently deciding not to go higher, but, but we would—let’s say, if we get to that level—and then the question is, how long do you stay at that level?"
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,And that’s a whole other set of questions.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’re, we’re seeing, you know, through a combination of the, you know, the unwinding of the pandemic-related demand and supply distortions and monetary policy’s work in suppressing demand or, or, you know, alleviating very high demand—the combination of those two things is actually working."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"For now, the question is trying to find that level where we think we can stay there."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"That’s, that’s what we’re—that’s, that’s the stage we’re at, though."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,NICK TIMIRAOS.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"But it looks like there was—because there was an across-the-board drop in the core PCE projection—core PCE inflation projection for this year, and even then it seems possible that core PCE inflation could come in even lower than the median at 3.7 percent."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Would you see a case to raise rates still if it turned out that you were going to achieve the same real rate this year because the decline in inflation proceeds somewhat better than you—than you currently anticipate?
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know—I also think, you know, this is why we’re in a position to, to move carefully again."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"The decision that we make at, you know, at each meeting and, certainly, at the—at the last two meetings this year—it’s going to depend on the totality of all the data: so, the inflation data, the labor market data, the growth data, the, the balance of risks, and the other events that are happening out there."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,And we haven’t—we haven’t gotten to a point of confidence about that yet.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,And so what are we seeing?
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, again, that’s another reason why we’re—why we’re moving carefully now, because, you know, there are lags here."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, again, I would say, you know—you know “sufficiently restrictive” only when you see it."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"You—it’s not something you can arrive at with confidence in a model or, or in various estimates, you know."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,We know that.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"The fact that we’ve come this far lets us really proceed carefully, as I keep saying."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I think, you know, that’s, that’s the end we’re trying to achieve."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"I wouldn’t want to handicap the likelihood of it, though."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s not up to me to do that.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Nick.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"We, we know that we have to do that, and we know the public depends on us doing that, and we know that we have to do it so that we can achieve the kind of labor market that we all want to achieve, which is an extended period—sustained period of strong labor market conditions that benefit all."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"Nick Timiraos, the Wall Street Journal."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,NICK TIMIRAOS.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,And can you explain what would constitute enough evidence that will allow the FOMC to normalize the nominal stance of policy while keeping real policy settings sufficiently restrictive?
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mean, yes—we, we understand that it’s a real rate that will matter and that needs to be sufficiently restrictive."
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Is the FOMC focused on targeting a real level of policy restriction?
2023-09-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"Chair Powell, both you and Vice Chair Williams have indicated that “sufficiently restrictive” will be judged on a real rather than nominal basis, implying some scope for nominal rate cuts next year—provided further compelling evidence that price pressures will continue to subside."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,They haven’t been shy about that.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thanks, Mr. Chairman."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Scott Horsley from NPR.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Last week you and your colleagues put forward a proposal to lower the cap on debit card swipe fees for comment.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Could you just talk a little bit about the considerations there—what it would mean for merchants, for banks, for consumers, and also just what you all are seeing in terms of the use of both debit and credit cards in the—in the payment system?"
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, so you’re right."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"We put a proposal out for comment, is what we did."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, this is a job that Congress assigned us, as you, of course, know, in Dodd-Frank, and all we can really do is faithfully implement the statute."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"That’s, that’s all we’re trying to do."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,What else can we really do?
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s a 90-day comment period, and we typically don’t comment on these things once they’re out for—out for comment."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,And we do hope that stakeholders—and we know that they will use this opportunity to express their views.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"So that’s, that’s critical and that’s, that’s what I can say about that now."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,And we tend to look at a few of them.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Scott.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"I’m not going to give you the names, but, you know, they’re a few of the common ones that people look at."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"And so they’re looking at things like the level of the dollar, the level of equity prices, the level of rates, the credit spreads."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Sometimes they’re pulling in credit availability and things like that, so it isn’t any one thing."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"We would never look at, for example, long-term Treasury rates in isolation, nor would we ignore them."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"But we would look at them as part of a broader picture, and they do play a role, of course, in many of the major standard financial condition indexes."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Your second question was?
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,JONNELLE MARTE.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,On the banking stress.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Banking stress—so it’s something we’re watching.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"And so we’ve been working a lot with financial institutions to make sure that they have good funding plans and good—and that they have a plan for how to deal with the kind of portfolio, unrealized, losses that they have."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,And we do think the banking system is quite resilient.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"We had, you know, a handful of bank failures but—so that’s, that’s what we’re out there doing."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we don’t have any reason to think that this—that these rate hikes are materially changing that picture, which is one of a strong banking system and one where there’s a strong focus by banks and by supervisors on liquidity, on funding, and those sorts of things."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,SCOTT HORSLEY.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"As you know, we, we did have—there were issues with interest rate risk and also funding uninsured deposits in the March—the things we went through in March and thereafter."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,EDWARD LAWRENCE.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, for the first year or so of our tightening cycle, the risk was all on the side of not doing enough."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’re, you know, we’re— we’ve come far enough that, that the risks, you know, have gotten more two sided."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"You can’t identify that with a lot of precision, but it does feel like the, the risks are more two sided now."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"And—but we’re committed to getting inflation back down to our target over time, and we will."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Simon.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"That’s a—that’s a prescription for misery, and, and so we’re really committed to not letting that happen."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,SIMON RABINOVITCH.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Quick follow-up to the question about banking stresses—you talked about how the banking system is resilient.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Of course, part of the resilience the past year stems from the Bank Term Funding Program that you launched in March."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Given that bond prices have not recovered, that unrealized losses are probably mounting, how likely is it that you might have to extend that program in March next year?"
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"We look at a very wide range of financial conditions and, in fact, as you’ll know, different organizations publish different financial conditions’ indexes, which can have, you know, 7 or 8 variables, or they can have 100 variables, so there’s a very rich environment."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Good question.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Simon Rabinovitch with the Economist."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Inflation will be both more—both higher and more volatile.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we know that, if we fail to restore price stability, the risk is that expectations of higher inflation get entrenched in the economy, and we know that that’s really bad for people."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s always the question we’re asking ourselves.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thanks, Chair."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Edward Lawrence with Fox Business.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"So for the last three months, the year-over-year PCE inflation was at 3.4 percent, core well over 3 percent."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"You’ve said in the past, 2 percent remains the Federal Reserve target, but with no rate increase today, how long would you be okay then with a 3 percent or 3 percent plus overall inflation?"
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, the, the progress is probably going to come in lumps and be bumpy, but we’re making progress."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, I think the core PCE [inflation rate] came down by almost 60 basis points in the third quarter."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"So the best thing I could point you to would be the September SEP where, you know, the expectation was that, that inflation by the end of next year, on a 12-month trailing basis, would be well into the 2s and the year after that, further into the 2s."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"So that’s, that’s—if you look historically, that’s, that’s sort of consistent with the way inflation comes down."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"It does take some time, and as you get—you know, as you get further and further from those highs, it may actually take longer time."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"But the good news is, you know, we’re making progress and monetary policy is restrictive."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we feel like we’re on a path to make more progress, and it’s essential that we do."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,EDWARD LAWRENCE.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"But you’ve said in the past that doing too little on interest rates could take years to fix, but the cost of doing too much could be easily fixed."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Edward.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,How robust was the debate about this pause on the doing-too-little side?
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"And if there were judgment that higher—that the higher- term premium was endangering the dual-mandate goals, would that be reason to think about slowing or suspending QT or should we think of that as a more technical question around reserves?"
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"And you saw the spread at the September meeting of—you know, it’s a relatively small spread of—people think one or two additional hikes."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,So you’re close to the—to the end of the cycle.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"That’s—that was an impression as of, I believe, as of September."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s not a promise or a plan of the future.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,And so we’re going into these meetings one by one.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,We’re looking at the data.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’re looking at the full range of economic data, including financial conditions and all of those things that we look at, and then we’re, we’re—you know, we’ve, we’ve come very far with this rate hiking cycle, very far."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"As I mentioned, we’re also—we’re being careful."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Monetary policy is restrictive.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"We see its effects, particularly in interest-sensitive spending and other channels."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,So that’s how I think about it.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Neil.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,NEIL IRWIN.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,We’re proceeding carefully because we can proceed carefully at this time.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s the question we’re asking.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, we’re going meeting by meeting."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"In terms of—so we’re not really changing the way—in terms of growth, what I said was “below potential.” So what you have here recently is growth that is—that is temporarily— potential growth is elevated for a year or two right now over its trend level."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,We haven’t really—we haven’t really been thinking about that yet.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"So the right way to think about it is, what’s potential growth this year?"
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"People think trend growth over a long period of time is a little bit less than 2 percent, or I would say just around 2 percent."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"But what we’ve had is, with the—with the, you know, improvement in the size of the labor force, as I mentioned, through both participation and immigration, and with the, the, you know, the better functioning in the labor market and with the—with the, you know, the unwinding of the supply chain and shortages and those kinds of things, you’re seeing actually elevated potential growth."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,There’s catch-up growth that can happen in potential.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,We’re asking ourselves whether we’ve achieved a stance of policy that is sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation down to 2 percent over time.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,And that means that if you’re growing—you could be growing at 2 percent this year and still be growing below the increase in the potential output of the economy.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s really what’s going on.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s why I would say it as below potential.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHAEL MCKEE.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"But if you could clarify what I asked about the meeting by meeting, are we essentially now supposed to assume that it’s a meeting by meeting, live meeting with a chance of a rate increase that will be decided on subjective criteria rather than objective at each meeting?"
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mean, I don’t know that I want to just accept anybody’s characterization, but I’ll tell you how we’re doing this."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,I hope that’s clear.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Chair Powell."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Neil Irwin with Axios.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"In light of the run-up in long-term yields we’ve seen the last several weeks, have you given any consideration to the pace of your asset runoff program?"
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,And we’ll take them seriously.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,We’ll read them.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"I’ll say what, what I do expect is that we will—we will come to a—we’re a consensus-driven organization."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,We’ll come to a package that has broad support on the Board.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,VICTORIA GUIDA.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,So is broad support mean more support than the proposal had?
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, we’ve extended the deadline."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Jonnelle.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,JONNELLE MARTE.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Jonnelle Marte with Bloomberg.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, in addition to persistence, when you look at long-term Treasury yields, what else are you watching to evaluate how those tighter financial conditions are hitting the economy and if it will lessen the need for further tightening?"
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Also, do you think that those higher yields could affect banking stress?"
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,It means broad support.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"We won’t get those comments until the end of, well, into next year."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,And we expect a lot of comment.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, that proposal is out for comment."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,So the Committee is not considering changing the pace of balance sheet runoff.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s not something we’re talking about or considering, and I know there are many candidate explanations for why rates have been going up."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,And QT is certainly on that list.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"It may be playing a relatively small effect, although I would say at $3.3 trillion in reserves, it’s not—I think—I think it’s hard to make a case that reserves are even close to scarce at this point."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,So that’s not something that we’re—that we’re looking at right now.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Victoria.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,VICTORIA GUIDA.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Hi.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Victoria Guida with Politico.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,I wanted to ask about the Basel III Endgame capital proposal.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"You’ve gotten a lot of “pushback” from people on different aspects of the proposal, and you yourself expressed some reservations."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,And I’m just curious: Could you accept finalizing that proposal without significant changes?
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,So what do we look at?
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"We—you know, it’s November 1, and that’s a decision we’ll be making in the first quarter of next year."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"We think, and I think, that the risks are getting more balanced."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Okay.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,So—and you see wage increases coming down as we discussed but coming down in a kind of gradual way.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think that’s—we want to see that, that whole set of processes continue."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Bryan.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,BRYAN MENA.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Bryan Mena, CNN."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"And with labor demand still clearly remaining very strong—when you have the kind of job growth we’ve had over the last quarter, it’s still very strong demand."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Do you think that there has been any structural change in either consumption or in the job market that’s pushing at consumption?
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,So I’m kind of wondering if there’s been any structural change in consumption.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,I wouldn’t say there’s been a structural change in consumption.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,I would say it’s certainly been strong.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,And so a couple of things.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"We may have underestimated the balance sheet strength of households and small businesses, and that may be part of it."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"You obviously saw the third-quarter GDP figures, which were strong, and some economists expect everyone’s spending to have fizzled out by now."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"There may be—you know, we’ve been, like everyone else, trying to estimate the number—the amount of savings that households have from the pandemic when they couldn’t spend on services really at all, or in-person services."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"The second thing is, in the labor market, what we’ve seen is a very positive rebalancing of supply and demand, partly through just much more supply coming online."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Are we seeing—is inflation still coming down?
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"That range, if you take off a mainstream estimate of the expected inflation, take one year inflation, you’re going to see that."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,You’re going to see a real policy rate that is well above mainstream estimates of a neutral policy rate.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Now that’s arithmetic.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"It doesn’t really—the proof is really in how the economy reacts, but I would say that we’re in a place where those risks are getting closer to being in balance."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Okay.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,So that’s the first thing.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,And you said the proof is how the economy reacts.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Well, I think what we’re looking at is are we still—is inflation still broadly cooling?"
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Do we—is it sort of validating the path we saw over the summer, where inflation was clearly cooling and coming down."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Now we’ve seen periods like that before, and they’ve just—there hasn’t been follow-through."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,The data have bounced back.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,So what are we seeing?
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,What are you looking at to be sure you’re not overshooting?
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, there can still be more of that than we think, although at a certain point we have to—we’re going to be getting back to pre-pandemic levels of savings."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,We may not be there yet.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"So things are—clearly, people are still spending."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"I wouldn’t want to speculate too much, but I’ll just say so—you know, really the question there is, does the war spread more widely and does it start to do things like affect oil prices in particular, since this is the Middle East we’re talking about."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,The price of oil has really not reacted very much so far to this.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"As the—you know, as the Fed—as the Federal Open Market Committee, our job is really to talk about [and] to understand the economy and economic effects."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"And it isn’t clear, at this point, that the conflict in the Middle East is going to—is on track to have significant economic effects."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,I’m just wondering how the Fed is monitoring these developments in the Middle East—you mentioned they are—and just what the potential economic impact could be if the conflict does spread to other countries in the region.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"That doesn’t mean it isn’t incredibly important and something for people to, you know, to take really important notice of, but it may or may not turn out to be something that matters for the Federal Open Market Committee as an economic body."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,And that’s what it’s doing—[it] is calling out a risk of that.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"And the war in Ukraine, the same."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"The war in Ukraine did have, immediately, very significant macroeconomic implications because of the connection to commodities."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, thank you."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks very much.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’re laying out there our thinking, and, you know, as we approach the meeting, we’ll all be— my colleagues and I will be talking about how we’re processing that data."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,But—so what the Financial Stability Report does is it “calls out” risks.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"The Fed’s Financial Stability Report said the Israel–Hamas conflict and the conflict in Ukraine “pose important risks to global economic activity, including the possibility of sustained disruptions to regional trade and food, energy, and other commodities.” You’ve had organizations at the World Bank warning of a possible surge in oil prices if the war spreads to other countries in the region."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Just a quick question following up on an earlier one with regards to the Israel–Hamas conflict.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,I’m Daniel Avis from Agence France-Presse.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"The dynamic has been really strong job creation with now wages that are—that are higher than inflation, in the aggregate anyway, and that raises real disposable income, and that raises spending, which continues to drive more hiring."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"And so you’ve had a really—that whole—that whole dynamic has been, and also at the same time, the pandemic effects are wearing off, so that goods availability, automobile availability is better—or was better, I think it still is."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, from a business standpoint, there are more people to hire."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,And it is more labor supply.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"So the whole thing has led to more growth, more spending, and that kind of thing."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"And it’s been—you know, it’s been good, and the thing is, we’ve been achieving progress on inflation in the middle of this."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, it’s been a dynamic."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"The question is, how long can that continue?"
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, I just think this—the existence of this second set of factors at this time, which is the unwinding of the pandemic effects, that’s what makes this cycle unique, I think, and, you know, we’re still learning."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"That took longer for that process to begin than we thought, and we’re still learning about how it plays out."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s all we can do.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Let’s go to Daniel for the last question.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,DANIEL AVIS.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you, Chair Powell."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"The risk of doing too much versus the risk of doing too little are getting—are getting more— closer to balance, because policy is I think clearly restrictive at 5¼ to 5½ percent."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,I’ll just say that they’re getting more balanced.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,But you can see that.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"You can see by the fact that we have slowed down, although we’re still—we’re still—we’re still trying to gain confidence in what the appropriate stance is."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Megan.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,MEGAN CASSELLA.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Chair Powell."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Megan Cassella with Barron’s.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks for taking our questions.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,I wanted to see if you could talk about the neutral rate.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"You mentioned today that you’re still debating whether rates are sufficiently restrictive, and you’ve recently said that evidence is suggesting policy is not too tight right now."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Yeah.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,So first thing to say is that it’s very important.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s a very important variable in, in the way we think about monetary policy, but you can’t identify it with any precision in real time."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,And we know that.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,So you have to just take that—you have to take your estimate of it with a grain of salt.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I was curious if you could elaborate on that at all and whether that means the neutral rate, in your view, has risen."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"And that’s, of course—we believe that’s critical in winning the battle."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"You can always find one reading that is a little bit out of whack, but, honestly, the bulk of them are just very clear that the public believes that inflation will come down."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,So—and there’s no real crack in that—in that armor.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Sorry.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Quick second question about inflation expectations—the U. Michigan sentiment survey showed a big jump in one-year-ahead inflation expectations last month from 3.2 to 4.2.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Last year you said that particular survey was a really decisive factor in one of your rate hike decisions.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"If it stays elevated next time around, how big of an input will that be into your December thinking?"
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Yeah.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"We look at a range of, of things."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think the, the, the, you know, the UM thing got blown out of proportion a little bit."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,It was actually a preliminary estimate that got revised away.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I said it was preliminary in it, but that didn’t get picked up."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we look at many, many things."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"So really, look across the broad array of surveys and also market-based estimates, and, you know, we do that really carefully at every meeting and between meetings."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, there’s—it’s just clear that inflation expectations are in a good place."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"The public does believe that inflation will get back down to 2 percent over time,."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,And it will— they’re right.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"What we know now is, you know, within a range of estimates of the neutral rate policy, is restrictive, and it’s therefore putting downward pressure on economic activity, hiring, and inflation."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,SIMON RABINOVITCH.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,So we do—we do talk about this.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Some people think it has, some people haven’t said—that don’t think it has."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, in a way, it’s just validating that decline, and it was very close to our expectations internally, too."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,So I think we feel good about that.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Also I would say it isn’t—in my thinking, it’s not the case that, that wages have been the principal driver of inflation so far, although I think it’s all—I do think it’s fair to say that, as we go forward, as monetary policy becomes more important relative to the supply-side issues I’ve talked about in the unwinding of the pandemic effects, it may be that the labor market becomes more important over time, too."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Nancy.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,And then the September reading was more or less at the same level as the June reading.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Hi.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Chair Powell, are you now as concerned about overshooting and raising interest rates too much as you are about getting inflation down to the 2 percent target?"
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, as I mentioned, I think for much of the last year and a half, the concern was not doing too, too—not doing enough."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,It was not getting rates high enough in time to avoid having inflation expectations—higher inflation expectations become entrenched.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,So that was the concern.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think we’ve reached, you know, now more than 18 months into this."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Nancy Marshall-Genzer with Marketplace.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"And so what you saw with the ECI reading was, if you look back a couple—it comes out four times a year—if you look back a couple of quarters, you’ll see it was much higher, then it came down substantially in June."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,So that’s what you see.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,And you have to look at a group of them because any one of them can be idiosyncratic from—in any given reading.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Ultimately, it’s unknowable, and so really again, what we’re focused on is, you know, looking at the data and giving ourselves a little more time now to look carefully at the data by being careful in our moves."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Does it—does it feel like monetary policy is restrictive enough to bring inflation down to 2 percent over time?
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s the question we’re asking ourselves.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think, you know, years from now economists will be revising their estimates of r* as it existed on November 1, 2023."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,You can’t—we can’t really wait for that in making policy.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"We have to look—we have to have those models and look at them and think about them, and, ultimately, we’ve got to look at the effects that policy is having, accounting for the lags, which makes it difficult."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,MEGAN CASSELLA.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,If I could follow up on a wages point.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Earlier you talked about the inflation outlook, but I’m curious if you have any concerns whether wage inflation at its current level could be—could risk pushing up overall inflation or re-acceleration?"
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, if you look at the—look at the broad range of wages, they have— wage increases have really come down significantly over the course of the last 18 months to a level where they’re substantially closer to that level that would be consistent with 2 percent inflation over time, making standard assumptions about productivity over time."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,So it’s much closer than it was.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"And that’s true of the ECI, which is the one that’s—the one that we got this week."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s true of average hourly earnings and compensation per hour, too."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"So—and all of them are kind of saying that, which is great."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"There’s not any debate or attempt to, you know, to sort of agree as a group on what—whether r* has moved or not."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, you know, I think we try to be as transparent as we can about the way we’re thinking about these things."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Michael McKee from Bloomberg Television and Radio.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, nonetheless, it’s out there."

2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Chair Powell."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you so much for taking our questions.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"I wonder, you know, if you don’t raise interest rates in December, would the presumption be at that point that we should expect that rates are at their peak, or is there a possibility of restarting rate increases next year?"
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,And are there any costs to taking a more extended pause?
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,You’re asking a hypothetical there.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"But we’re going into December meeting—we’ll get, as you know, two more inflation ratings, two more labor market readings, some data on, on economic activity, and so we’ll be taking—and also the broader situation, the broader financial condition situation and broader world situation."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,We’ll be looking at all those things as we make a decision in December.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,We haven’t made that decision.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"I would say, though, that, that the idea that if you—the idea that would—difficult to raise again after stopping for a meeting or two, it’s just not right."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mean, the Committee will always do what it thinks is appropriate at the time."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, let me start by saying we haven’t made a decision about September."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, again, we haven’t made any decisions about— at all about December."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"And that’s—that is—the way we’re going to be going into these future meetings is to be, you know, just determining the extent of any additional further policy tightening that may be appropriate to return inflation to 2 percent over time."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"We have not made a determination, and we’re not—I will say that we’re not confident at this time that we’ve reached such a stance."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,But that’s critical.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Things are fluctuating back and forth—that’s not what we’re looking for.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"With financial conditions, we’re looking for persistent changes that are material."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"The second thing is that, that the longer-term rates that have moved up—they can’t simply be a reflection of, of expected policy moves from us that we would then—that if we didn’t follow through on them, then the rates would come back down."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, and I would say on that, it does not appear that an expectation of higher near-term policy rates is causing the increase in longer-term rates."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, in the meantime, though, perhaps the most important thing is that these higher Treasury yields are showing through to higher borrowing costs for households and businesses and those higher costs are going to weigh on economic activity to the extent this tightening persists and the mind’s eye goes to the 8 percent—near 8 percent mortgage rate, which could have pretty significant effect on housing."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,We’re not confident that we haven’t; we’re not confident that we have.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,So that’s how I would answer your question.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Just as a quick follow-on, to be clear on this: In your opening statement just now, you seemed to imply that you are not yet confident that financial conditions are restrictive enough to finish the fight."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Is that true?
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Yes.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s exactly right.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, to say it a different way: We haven’t made any decisions about, about future meetings."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,HOWARD SCHNEIDER.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,We didn’t even—we didn’t talk about making a decision in December today.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Really, it was a decision for this meeting and understanding broader things."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Well, I just—that’s, you know, the way our policy works is—and sometimes it works with lags, of course, which can be long and variable, but ultimately, if you raise interest rates, you do see those effects."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,And you see those effects in the economy now.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,You see what’s happening in the housing market.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,You’re seeing that now.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"You’ll see, if you look at surveys of people, it’s not a good time they think to buy durable goods of various kinds because rates are so high now."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"I’d like to follow up and ask what makes you confident—what makes you confident in the tighter financial conditions will slow above-trend growth when 500 basis points of rate hikes, QT, and a minor banking crisis have not thus far?"
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mention again, we’re getting reports from housing that the effects of this—of this could be quite significant."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,This has been a resilient economy.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"And it’s, I think, been surprising in its resilience."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,And there are a number of possible reasons why that may be.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Our job is to—is to achieve maximum employment and price stability, and so we take the economy as it comes."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"It has been resilient, so we just—we take it as it is."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,But you’re right.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,NICK TIMIRAOS.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"We just don’t know how persistent it’s going to be, and it’s tough to try to translate that in a way that I’d be comfortable communicating into how many rate hikes that is."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"And over time, that will have an effect."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Nick.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,NICK TIMIRAOS.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Nick Timiraos, the Wall Street Journal."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Chair Powell, did the Fed staff put a recession back into the baseline forecast in the materials for today’s meeting?"
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,And how much does this tightening and financial conditions substitute for rate hikes if the tightening is persistent?
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,You had said it was worth maybe a ¼ point when we had the bank failures in the spring.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,What is it here on something that’s presumably more straightforward and more familiar to simulate?
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,So I guess I don’t want to answer your question about the—about the recession.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"But the answer is “no.” I think I have to answer it, since we did publicly say in the minutes—you’ll know anyway in the [next] minutes—the staff did not put a recession back in."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mean, it would be hard to see how you would do that if you look at the—look at the activity we’ve seen recently, which is not really indicative of a recession in the near term."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"In terms of how to think about translation into rate hikes, I think it’s just too early to be doing that, and the main reason is we just don’t know how persistent this will be."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,You can see how volatile it is.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Different kinds of news will affect the level of rates, and I think any kind of an estimate that was precise would hang out there and have a great chance of looking wrong very quickly."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I think what we can say is that financial conditions have clearly tightened, and you can see that in the rates that, that consumers and households and businesses are paying now."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,And that is something that remains to be seen.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Colby.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,The first is that the tighter conditions would need to be persistent.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"As I mentioned, persistent changes in broader financial conditions can have implications for the path of monetary policy."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"The labor market remains tight, but supply and demand conditions continue to come into better balance."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Over the past three months, payroll job gains averaged 266,000 jobs per month, a strong pace that is nevertheless below that seen earlier in the year."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,The unemployment rate remains low at 3.8 percent.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Strong job creation has been accompanied by an increase in the supply of workers.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"The labor force participation rate has moved up since late last year, particularly for individuals aged 25 to 54 years, and immigration has rebounded to pre-pandemic levels."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Nominal wage growth has shown some signs of easing, and job vacancies have declined so far this year."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Higher interest rates also appear to be weighing on business fixed investment.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Although the jobs-to-workers gap has narrowed, labor demand still exceeds the supply of available workers."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Total PCE prices rose 3.4 percent over the 12 months ending in September.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 3.7 percent."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Inflation has moderated since the middle of last year, and readings over the summer were quite favorable."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,But a few months of good data are only the beginning of what it will take to build confidence that inflation is moving down sustainably toward our goal.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,The process of getting inflation sustainably down to 2 percent has a long way to go.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Despite elevated inflation, longer-term inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households, businesses, and forecastters, as well as measures from financial markets."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Inflation remains well above our longer-run goal of 2 percent.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,The Fed’s monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"After picking up somewhat over the summer, activity in the housing sector has flattened out and remains well below levels of a year ago, largely reflecting higher mortgage rates."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,I’ll have more to say about monetary policy after briefly reviewing economic developments.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Transcript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference November 1, 2023 CHAIR POWELL."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Good afternoon, everyone."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Welcome.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,My colleagues and I remain squarely focused on our dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"We understand the hardship that high inflation is causing, and we remain strongly committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Price stability is the responsibility of the Federal Reserve.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has been expanding at a strong pace and well above earlier expectations.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Without price stability, the economy does not work for anyone."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Since early last year, the FOMC has significantly tightened the stance of monetary policy."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,We have raised our policy interest rate by 5¼ percentage points and have continued to reduce our securities holdings at a brisk pace.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,The stance of policy is restrictive—meaning that tight policy is putting downward pressure on economic activity and inflation—and the full effects of our tightening have yet to be felt.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Today, we decided to leave our policy interest rate unchanged and to continue to reduce our securities holdings."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Given how far we have come, along with the uncertainties and risks we face, the Committee is proceeding carefully."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"We will make decisions about the extent of additional policy firming and how long policy will remain restrictive based on the totality of the incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"In particular, without price stability, we will not achieve a sustained period of strong labor market conditions that benefit all."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"My colleagues and I are acutely aware that high inflation imposes significant hardship as it erodes purchasing power, especially for those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"We are highly attentive to the risks that high inflation poses to both sides of our mandate, and we are strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent objective."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"As I noted earlier, since early last year, we have raised our policy rate by 5¼ percentage points, and we have decreased our securities holdings by more than $1 trillion."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,HOWARD SCHNEIDER.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Howard Schneider with Reuters.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you, Chair Powell, for doing this."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,To what—you referenced the rise in long-term bond yields—to what degree did that supplant action by the Fed at this meeting?
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks for your question.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Let’s go to Howard.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, I’ll talk about bond yields, but I want to take a second and just sort of set the broader context in which we’re looking at that."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Inflation has been coming down, but it’s still running well above our 2 percent target."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"The labor market has been rebalancing, but it’s still very tight by many measures."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"GDP growth has been strong, although many forecasters are forecasting, and they have been forecasting, that it will slow."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"As for the Committee, we are committed to achieving a stance of monetary policy that’s sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation down to 2 percent over time, and we’re not confident yet that we have achieved such a stance."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"So that is the broader context into which this, this strong economy and all the things I said—that’s the context in which we’re looking at this question of rates."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, obviously we’re monitoring, we’re attentive to the increase in longer-term yields and—which have contributed to a tightening of broader financial conditions since the summer."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, if you—if you look at the situation—let’s look at the economy first."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you, and I look forward to your questions."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum-employment and price-stability goals.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Our restrictive stance of monetary policy is putting downward pressure on economic activity and inflation.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,The Committee decided at today’s meeting to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 5¼ to 5½ percent and to continue the process of significantly reducing our securities holdings.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"We are committed to achieving a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation sustainably down to 2 percent over time, and to keeping policy restrictive until we are confident that inflation is on a path to that objective."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,We are attentive to recent data showing the resilience of economic growth and demand for labor.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Evidence of growth persistently above potential, or that tightness in the labor market is no longer easing, could put further progress on inflation at risk and could warrant further tightening of monetary policy."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Financial conditions have tightened significantly in recent months, driven by higher longer-term bond yields, among other factors."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Because persistent changes in financial conditions can have implications for the path of monetary policy, we monitor financial developments closely."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"In light of the uncertainties and risks, and how far we have come, the Committee is proceeding carefully."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"We will continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting, based on the totality of the incoming data and their implications for the outlook for economic activity and inflation as well as the balance of risks."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"In determining the extent of additional policy firming that may be appropriate to return inflation to 2 percent over time, the Committee will take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial developments."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,We remain committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal and to keeping longer-term inflation expectations well anchored.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Reducing inflation is likely to require a period of below-potential growth and some softening of labor market conditions.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Restoring price stability is essential to set the stage for achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the longer run.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"To conclude: We understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Everything we do is in service to our public mission.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"In this case, the tighter financial conditions we’re seeing—[coming] from higher long-term rates, but also from other sources, like the stronger dollar and lower equity prices—could matter for future rate decisions, as long as two conditions are satisfied."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,COLBY SMTH.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"In the third quarter, real GDP is estimated to have risen at an outsized annual rate of 4.9 percent, boosted by a surge in consumer spending."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Colby Smith with the Financial Times.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Well, I think everyone has been very gratified to see that we’ve been able to achieve, you know, pretty significant progress on inflation without seeing the kind of increase in unemployment that has been very typical of rate hiking cycles like this one."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"So that’s, that’s a historically unusual and very welcome result."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,And the same is true of growth.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, we’ve been saying that we need to see below-potential growth."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"And growth has been strong, but yet we’re still seeing this."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"But since the economy has not responded to rate hikes in ways that would normally be expected, have you changed your views on that at all—on how necessary or inevitable that kind of pain would be, say, for the labor market or overall growth?"
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think I still believe, and my colleagues for the most part I think still believe, that is likely to be true."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"So—but it’s only a good thing that we haven’t seen it, and I think we know why."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, since, since we lifted off, we, we have understood that there are really two processes at work here."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,One of them—one of which is the unwinding of the distortions to both supply and demand [that arose] from the pandemic and the response to the pandemic.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"And the other is, is, you know, restrictive monetary policy, which is moderating demand and giving the supply side time to recover—time and space to recover."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,So you see those two forces now working together to bring down inflation.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"But it’s that first one can bring down inflation without the need for higher unemployment or slower growth, it’s just—it’s supply—you know, supply-side improvements like shortages and bottlenecks and that kind of thing going away."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"It is still likely to be true—not a certainty—but likely that we will need to see some slower growth and some softening in the labor market—in labor market conditions to get, you know, to fully restore price stability."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s getting, you know, a significant increase in the size of the labor market now, both from labor force participation and from immigration."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,You’ve spoken before about the pain that would likely be coming for the economy in order to get inflation down.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Rachel Siegel from the Washington Post.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,I was very impressed by York as a town with a real strategy.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I would say it’s very impressive what the people there have put together in the face of, you know, some difficult longer-run trends about offshoring of manufacturing and that kind of thing."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"They’ve done a great job as a city, I think."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, what you hear—and it’s consistent there—which is people are really suffering under high inflation."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,You were there.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"We talked to some people who, you know, were feeling that in their businesses and other people who were feeling it in their home lives as well."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks for taking our questions.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, it’s painful for people—particularly people who don’t have a lot of extra financial resources who are spending most of their incoming, you know, income on the essentials of life."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,That wasn’t new.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"But that did come through very clearly in, in the conversations we had in York, and, you know, I walked away from that even—you know, I mean, just thinking that we really—the best thing we can do for the U.S. is to restore price stability—fully restore price stability and not fail in that task and do it as quickly as possible, but also with the least damage we can."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Rachel.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,RACHEL SIEGEL.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Hi Chair Powell.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,So we know that.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"That’s a big supply-side, you know, gain that is really helping the economy, and it’s part of why—part of why GDP is so high is because we’re getting that supply."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, we welcome that."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"But I think those things will run their course, and we’re probably still going to be left—we think, and I think—we’ll still be left with some ground to cover to get back to full price stability."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHAEL MCKEE.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"We don’t— we do personally update our forecast, but we don’t formally update the dot plot."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,I’m trying to connect the dots here.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"One quick clarification I wanted to ask about Rachel’s question is, you said you need slower growth."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,You had always said before a period of lower-than-trend growth.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, two, it sounds to me like you’re basically saying here that kind of the dot plot’s out the window, that every meeting is live with the possibility of a rate increase for right now—doesn’t matter about the turn of the year—and that there’s not an objective way to determine whether or not you’ve got enough tightening in the system."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Michael.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s just going to be a subjective judgment, meeting by meeting."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Well so, let’s talk about the dot plot first."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,So the dot plot is a picture in time of what the people in the Committee think is likely to be appropriate monetary policy in light of their own personal economic forecast.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"In principle, when things change, it’s not—that’s not, like, planned that anybody’s agreed to or that we will do."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"That’s a forecast that would change, for example—I mean, many things could change that would cause people to say, “I wouldn’t write down that dot six weeks later.” Think of the number of things that could change your mind on that."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,So I think the efficacy of the dot plot probably decays over the three-month period between that meeting and the next meeting.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, doing—slowing down is giving us, I think, a better sense of, of how much more we need to do, if we need to do more."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"We know that, and you can’t rush it."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,And that’s where monetary policy and what we do with demand is still going to be important.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,RACHEL SIEGEL.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Against that backdrop, if you’ve gotten any clarity on lags—if you have an economy that’s been so resilient to high rate increases, does that suggest to you that there isn’t necessarily this huge wave of tightening that's still coming through the pipeline and that it may have already come into effect?"
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, I continue to think it’s very hard to say."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"So it’s been one year at this meeting—one year ago, this was the fourth of our 75 basis points hikes."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,So that’s a full year since then.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think we are seeing the effects of, of all the hiking we did last year and this year—we’re seeing it."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s very hard to know exactly what that might be.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"But you can, for example—an example where you wouldn’t have felt this yet is, is debt that had been termed out."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,But it’s going to come due and have to get rolled over next year or the year after.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,So—and there are little things like that where the effects have just taken time to get into the economy.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,So I don’t—I think we have to make monetary policy under great uncertainty about how long the lags are.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think trying to make a clear—get a clear answer and say, “I’m just going to assume this is really not a good way to do it.” And this is one of the reasons why we have slowed the process down this year, was to give monetary policy time to get into the economy."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,And it takes time.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,I wouldn’t say I was terribly surprised.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Has that changed?
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"And just one quick thing: You, last month, had gone to York, Pennsylvania, where you talked to a lot of—or, yeah, last month, where you talked to a lot of small business owners."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,We’re not talking about rate cuts.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’re still very focused on the first question, which is, have we achieved a stance of monetary policy that’s sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation down to 2 percent over time sustainably?"
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,That is the question we’re focusing on.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"The next question, as you know, will be, for how long will we remain restrictive?"
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Will policy remain restrictive?
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,And what we’ve said there is that we’ll keep policy restrictive until we’re confident that inflation is on a sustainable path down to 2 percent.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"So it’s, it’s—the fact is the Committee is not thinking about rate cuts right now at all."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"That’ll be the next question, but honestly, right now we’re really tightly focused on the first question."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Steve.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,STEVE LIESMAN.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Steve Liesman, CNBC."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Mr. Chairman, I guess I had assumed that there was a tightening bias in the Committee."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"You say in the statement you’re looking to assess the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the extent to which you may need to hike additionally."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"The question of rate cuts just doesn’t come up because I think the first—it’s so important to get that first question, you know, as close to right as you can."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Could we see those maybe pulled forward or have to see more than what the September SEP indicated?
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"And just in terms of the tightening of financial conditions, if that is having some kind of offsetting effect in terms of the need to potentially again raise rates, what then is the potential impact on the trajectory of rate cuts?"
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"In terms of the thresholds that you’ve laid out of what could warrant further tightening, the additional evidence of persistently above-trend growth, or some kind of reversal in the recent easing of labor market tightness—that seems to suggest something more powerful than just one more ¼ point rate hike would be necessary."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Just curious, what sentiments did you hear from them or what did you pick up on and what would you—was there anything that surprised you the most in terms of what they talked about?"
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,And I’m just curious if that’s how the Committee sees it.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,So we’ve identified those factors.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Those were not meant to be the only factors or a specific test that we’re going to be applying with some metrics behind it.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, what’s happening with our progress toward the 2 percent inflation goal?"
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Is the labor market continuing to, broadly, cool off and achieve a better balance?"
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,We’ll be looking at that.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, growth—we look at growth insofar as it has implications for our two mandate goals."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"We look at that, and we look at broader financial conditions."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we’ll be looking at all of those things as we reach a judgment, you know, whether we need to further tighten policy."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, if we do reach that judgment, then we will further tighten policy."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,COLBY SMITH.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Okay.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,You didn’t say earlier that you were sufficiently restrictive.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,There were forecasts for two rate hikes among most members of the Committee.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Really, we’re going to be looking at the broader picture."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Would you say the bias right now is neutral, that there is no disposition to hike again and that the Committee largely has moved off of this forecast for two hikes?"
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Global geopolitical tensions are certainly elevated.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,And that goes for the war in Ukraine; it goes for the war between Israel and Hamas.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,We’re monitoring that.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Our job is to monitor those things for their economic implications.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, the UAW strike, as you point out is—appears to be coming to an end."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Oil prices have flattened out; they haven’t gone down.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, there are significant issues out there, as you point out."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,I guess they’ve gone down a little bit from their earlier peak.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,So there’s plenty of risk out there.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,And we’re very focused on getting confident that we have achieved a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s really our focus.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Great.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"But then you just said that, you know, we don’t—we haven’t made a determination."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,CHRIS RUGABER.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Another one is the possibility of government shutdown; we don’t know about that one.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"But I would go back to—the bigger picture from our standpoint is, we’ve got a very strong economy, strong labor market, making progress on the labor market, making progress on inflation."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,STEVE LIESMAN.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,How are you thinking about those?
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,I wouldn’t say that at all.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"I would say—I mean, the language, looking at it here, “In determining the extent of additional policy firming that may be appropriate to return inflation to 2 percent over time.” That’s the question we’re asking."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,So is it right to think of that as a hiking bias is still in the Committee here?
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"We haven’t used that term, but it’s fair to say that’s the question we’re asking is, should we hike more?"
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s not—it’s not, you know—that is the question, and you’re right that, in September, we wrote down one additional rate hike."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,No.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, you know—and we’ll [each] write down another forecast, as you know, in December."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Chris.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,CHRIS RUGABER.
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you, Chris Rugaber, at Associated Press."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Well, since the last meeting, the auto workers’ strike has finished, oil prices have leveled off, and yet, on the other hand, you have the outbreak of war between Israel and Hamas."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Sorry, one additional— CHAIR POWELL."
2023-11-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"How do you see all those factors, taken together, affecting the economy going forward?"
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we’re, we’re aware of the risk that we would hang on too long."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, we know that that’s a risk, and we’re very focused on not making that mistake."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we do regard the two—you know, we’ve come back into a better balance between the risk of overdoing it and the risk of underdoing it."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"Not only that, we were able to focus hard on the—on the price-stability mandate."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we’re getting back to the point where—which is what you do when you’re very far from, from one of them, one of the two mandates—you’re getting now back to the point where both mandates are important, and they’re, they’re more in balance, too."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"We see the same thing other people see, which is a strong economy, which really put up quite a performance in 2023."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"And the things we’ll be looking at, I’ve already described."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, we’re, we’re obviously looking hard at what’s happening with demand, and what we see?"
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,We see good evidence and good reason to believe that growth will come in lower next year.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,And you see what the forecasts are.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think the median growth—median participant wrote down 1.4 percent growth, but, you know, we’ll have to see."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I think we’ll be—we’ll be very much keeping that in mind, as we make policy going forward."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"If, if the economy starts to—looks like it’s starting to fall into a recession; if, if the jobless rate starts to rise."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, obviously, what we’ll do is we’ll look at the totality of the data, as I’ve mentioned a couple times, and, certainly, the labor data would be important in that."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,Michael McKee from Bloomberg Television and Radio.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHAEL MCKEE.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,Michael McKee.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, if you—if you can describe a situation like that where if, if there were the beginning of a recession or something like that, then, yes, that would certainly weigh heavily on that decision."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, but would you take that as a signal that you should cut rates?"
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,VICTORIA GUIDA.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"That’s what we’re, we’re trying very much to achieve and not something that we’re looking to see."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"Obviously, we’re hoping to, to see something very different—which is a continuation of what we have seen, which is the labor market coming into better balance without a significant increase in unemployment, inflation coming down without a significant increase in unemployment, and growth moderating without a significant increase in unemployment."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s very hard to predict.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s not something we’re hoping to see.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"Mr. Chairman, you were, by your own admission, behind the curve in starting to raise rates to fight inflation, and you said earlier, again, “the full effects of our tightening (cycle) have not yet been felt.” How will you decide when to cut rates, and how will you ensure you’re not behind the curve there?"
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’ll also be looking to see progress on inflation and, you know, the labor market remaining strong but, but ideally, without seeing the kind of large increase in unemployment that happens sometimes."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"So that’s not something—you know this, but allow me to say it again: We don’t debate or discuss what the right, you know, whose SEP is right."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"If I could follow up: When you begin the cutting cycle, will it be essentially run the same way you do it now with raising rates, where you basically do trial and error, cut and see what happens, or will you tie it to some particular measure of progress?"
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, yeah."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"They’re all contributing in different—at different levels, you know, meeting by meeting—or, rather, report by report."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,VICTORIA GUIDA.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, in fact, all three of the categories of core [prices] are now contributing: goods, housing services, nonhousing services."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"We are seeing some progress there, though."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"It has been sticky, and famously, the service sector is thought to be stickier, but we’ve actually seen reasonable progress in nonhousing services, which was the area where, where you would expect to see less progress."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"Well, that’s what we’re finding out, and we’ve, you know, we’ve seen real progress in, in core inflation."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,How sticky is core inflation right now?
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"And you focused on core inflation, we’ve heard from—in other meetings."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,EDWARD LAWRENCE.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"So but, but it could be more of what I just described."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"It depends on—the economy can evolve in many different ways, right?"
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"But it wouldn’t need to be a sign of—it could just be a sign that the economy is normalizing, and it doesn’t need the tight policy."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"So and it’s, you know, it’s important for people to know that."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"We just say what they are, and we tabulate them and publish them."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"That’s, that’s just cumulating what people wrote down."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"It wouldn’t, if that were to—first of all, let me just say, that isn’t a plan."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"So if the Fed cuts rates as the dot plot is, is showing, about 75 basis points, does that signal that there’s a belief of weakness next year in the economy?"
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,Edward Lawrence of Fox Business.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,EDWARD LAWRENCE.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,Edward.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’re sort of just at the beginning of, of that discussion."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"I don’t—the answer is, these are things that we haven’t, you know, really worked out yet."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"We haven’t typically tried to articulate, with one exception, really specific target levels, which was if you—some of you will remember the thresholds that we used in, I guess, 2013."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHAEL MCKEE.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,Sorry—if?
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, claims are low."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"Would that be a sign that you’ve, you’ve done your job demand-wise?"
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s— you see—you see job growth still strong but moving back down to more sustainable levels, given population growth and labor force participation."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"So on, on the better-balance side, there are just a lot of things."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,What would you need to see to conclude that it has reached that balance?
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, in particular, you’ve referred even today to evidence that it’s coming into better balance."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,How do you interpret the state of the labor market right now?
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,Neil Irwin with Axios.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Chair Powell."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,NEIL IRWIN.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,Let’s go to Neil.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"It just is— it’s the way, the way our policy works."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"It could even mean, ultimately, that we would need to hike again."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,The things that are not quite—but let me go on with that list.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,That could mean that it takes longer to get to 2 percent inflation.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, if you have—if you have growth that’s robust, what that will mean is probably it will keep the labor market very strong."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s only a problem insofar as it makes it more difficult for us to achieve our goals.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s only a problem inso—it’s not itself a problem.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"I guess the—I guess the question I’m asking, if you don’t mind a quick follow-up, I guess the question I’m asking is, is above-trend growth itself a problem?"
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,JEANNA SMIALEK.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, and so that’s how I would answer."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"We will get it down to 2 percent, but, you know, if we see stronger growth, we’ll—we will set policy according to what we actually see."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,It might actually mean that it takes a little longer to get inflation down to 2 percent.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,That’ll be good for the labor market.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"If we have stronger growth, you know, that’ll be good for people."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,So that’s what—that’s what we’d be looking for.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"It probably will, will place some upward pressure on inflation."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"If you look at surveys of businesses, they’re, they’re— sort of the era of this frantic labor shortage, [those kinds of worker shortages] are behind us, and they’re seeing a shortage of labor as being significantly alleviated."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"If you look at shortages of workers, whereas they thought job, job availability was the highest that it’d ever been or close to it, that’s now down to more normal levels by so many measures—participation, unemployment—so many measures: the unemployment—job openings, quits, all of those things."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,So wages are still running a bit above what would be consistent with 2 percent inflation over a long period of time.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"I wanted to ask, you know, on, on the flip side of if things start to deteriorate rapidly, if we do fall into a recession, if we do start to see unemployment rise, at sort of the levels of inflation that we’re seeing now, how would you all think about that in terms of rate cuts?"
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,Victoria Guida with Politico.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,Hi.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,VICTORIA GUIDA.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,Victoria.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"The thing that we can do is to do our jobs, which is to use our tools to foster price stability, which has such great benefits over such long periods of time, and which is the thing that really enables us to work for and achieve an extended period of high employment, which is so beneficial for, you know, families and, and companies around the country."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,But we do see those—we see those public opinion surveys.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,And so that might help improve the mood of people.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"So [nominal] wages are now moving up more than inflation, as inflation comes down."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, so what will happen with that is, wages are now—[changes in] real wages are now positive."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"So people are still living with high prices, and that’s, that’s not—that is something that people don’t like."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"But overall, in the aggregate, the price level is not."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"Prices of some, some goods and services are coming down."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"A common theme is that, while inflation is coming down, and that’s very good news, the price level is not coming down."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,It may be.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"What do you think explains this disconnect, and does it matter for policymakers?"
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"Yet when we—when we hear from the general public, there’s a lot of discord about economic conditions."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, I’d say the mood among economists at the moment seems to be one of cautious optimism, which is somewhat corroborated by your forecast by the sense that we are going to have a soft landing."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"Claire Jones, Financial Times."

2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s been a good time for workers to find jobs and get solid wage increases.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"And these are—but, but I would just say, overall, the development of the labor market has been very positive."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I guess there, there are just a couple of other—the unemployment rate is very, very low."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"But if wages are running around 4 percent, that’s still a bit above, I would say."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,They’ve been gradually cooling off.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,Okay.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,Yeah.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,CATARINA SARAIVA.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks for taking our questions.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Chair Powell."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,MEGAN CASSELLA.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,We’ll go to Megan for the last question.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,Okay.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"But so far, it hasn’t."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"And it’s so far, so good—although we kind of assume that it will get harder from here."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,The labor market keeps getting back into balance.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mean, inflation keeps coming down."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,We just don’t know.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"But to say with certainty that the last mile is going to be different, I’d be reluctant to, you know, to suggest that we have any certainty around that."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"That’s, that’s very possible."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,Megan Cassella with Barron’s.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"Immigration could help, but it may be that, at some point—at some point, you will run out of supply-side help, and then it gets down to demand, and it gets harder."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"The question is, you know, once, once that part of it runs out—and we think it has a ways to run; we definitely think that the sort of supply chain and shortages side has some, some ways to run—does labor force participation have much more to run?"
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,It happened so far.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, something like that has happened."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we, we had the view that you could come straight down that vertical supply curve to the extent demand [was] lowered, reduced."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, we had the view—my colleagues and I broadly had the view—that we could get a lot of—you know, you had essentially a vertical supply curve, because you ran into the limits of, of capacity at very low levels, because there weren’t workers and because people couldn’t—the supply chains were all broken."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,So this is just very unusual.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"It was a combination of very strong demand, without question, and unusual supply-side restrictions, both on the goods side but also on the labor side, because we had a—we had a participation shock."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think that this inflation was not the classic demand overload, pot-boiling-over, kind of inflation that we [typically] think about."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"So it’s not that—it may or may not be about “different,” the U.S. economy being different."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,If there was something different about the U.S. economy.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,JEAN YUNG.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"Sorry, say your—say the last part of your question again."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,It might.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,I want to ask about the balance sheet given the Fed’s focus now on proceeding carefully and considering rate cuts.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"And can you talk us through what the latest thinking is, and has there been any consideration of altering the pace of quantitative tightening at all?"
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,So it’s ultimately all about the outlook and the balance of risks as well.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks very much.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"So you can imagine, you’d have to know what the reason is to know whether it would be appropriate to do those two things at the same time."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, if you’re—if you’re—if you’re cutting rates because you’re going back to normal, that’s one thing, [and distinct from] if you’re cutting them because the economy is really weak."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"And the answer is, it depends on the reason."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"You’re asking, though, the question, I guess you’re implying the question of can you continue with QT at such time—QT, which is a tightening action—at such time as policy is still tight?"
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I think they’re, they’re on independent tracks."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"Is that time to rethink, or are you still going to follow that thinking?"
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"Do you anticipate adjusting that thinking at all by the time you’re, you’re considering or moving forward with rate cuts?"
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,MEGAN CASSELLA.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, so far—so far, it’s working pretty much as expected, we think."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,We’re watching it carefully.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,There isn’t a lot of evidence of that.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,We’re not—we don’t think we’re at those [levels judged consistent with ample] reserves.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’re not at those levels, you know, with, with reserves close to 3.5 trillion [dollars]."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, we still have—you know that we intend to reduce our securities holdings until we judge that the quantity of reserve balances has reached a level somewhat above that consistent with ample reserves, and we also intend to slow and then stop the decline in size of the balance sheet when reserve balances are somewhat above the level judged to be consistent with ample reserves."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, at that point, reserves will start to come down."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"At a certain point, you know, there won’t be any more to come out of, or there’ll be a level where [take-up at] the reverse repo facility levels out."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"The reverse repo facility [take- up] has been coming down quickly, and reserves have been either moving up or—as a result—or holding steady."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s showing up.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,I think we’re down—we’re close to 1.2 trillion [dollars].
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s adding up.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"What we’ve been seeing is, you know, that we’re allowing runoff each month."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,So the balance sheet seems to be working pretty much as expected.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’re, we’re not talking about altering the pace of QT right now, just to get that out of the way."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,We thought those two things were going to be necessary.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"And the second thing would be our policy, which was weighing on aggregate demand and actually making it easier for the supply side to recover because of lower demand."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"The first factor is just the unwinding of, of what happened in the pandemic: the distortions of supply and demand."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, we felt since the beginning that it would be a combination of two factors."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,Maybe people just bought so much stuff that they temporarily don’t want any more stuff.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"There’s— you can make a case for that, that the shift back into services has not been complete, and it doesn’t look like it’s ongoing, but I don’t know if that’s right."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"In terms of demand, has demand shifted more away from services into goods?"
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, over the course of this year, we really slowed down a lot to give those lags time to work."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"We started slowing down at this meeting last year, reducing the pace at which we were adding restriction."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,So that’s one of the reasons why we slowed down this year.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"Some—someone once said that you know the—you know the natural rate of interest by its works, and that’s really right, but that’s very difficult because policy operates with a lag."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we’re going to be making policy in this, you know, difficult, uncertain, really unprecedented environment."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,So it’s just that it’s going to be uncertain.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, people will be writing papers about that 10 years from now and still fighting about it."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"The thing is, we’re not really going to know that."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"And so, for example, if it’s risen, and I’m not saying that it has, but if it were to have risen, that would mean that, that interest rates would need to be a little bit higher to convey the same level of restriction."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"The one that would affect—the one that comes to mind, though, is just the question of where the neutral rate of interest is."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"The question of whether there have been fundamental structural shifts is, is really hard to know the answer and a very interesting one right now."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"Do you think that there’s been significant structural shifts, and is that going to change how you look at a rate cut path?"
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"And do you see—I mean, how are you, when you think about, you know, starting to think about the rate cuts next year or whenever they come, how do you, you know, how do you think about the economy we’re in now kind of post-pandemic?"
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,Okay.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,CATARINA SARAIVA.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"So until about midmorning, a little, maybe late morning, it’s okay to update, and I believe some people did update their forecast based on what we saw today."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"After that, so staff has to—has to cumulate all of that and create the documents that you see."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"So it’s very late in the game, you know, to—but nonetheless, participants are allowed to, encouraged to update their SEP forecast until probably midmorning today."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we got—we got CPI the morning of the first day, and we got PPI the next day, which informs the, you know, the translation into PCE [inflation]."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,Right.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"I’m assuming those were not incorporated into the forecast we see today, but I just wanted to ask, you know, how that kind of adds to your thinking, you know, on the inflation outlook."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"I just wanted to ask a little bit about, you know, we had some pretty positive data this, you know, this morning and yesterday."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks for taking our questions.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,Catarina Saraiva of Bloomberg News.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,They haven’t got anyplace to put it.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,Let’s go to Catarina.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,[Laughter] MICHELLE SMITH.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,JENNIFER SCHONBERGER.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,I think—I think this.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,Or is it something different about the U.S. economy?
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"I’m curious, do you think something has changed in our understanding of inflation, or do you subscribe to this notion still?"
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"Over the past couple of years, a lot of central bankers have talked about the more difficult last mile of getting inflation back down to 2 percent, yet it’s also been surprising how fast inflation has come down this year."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,I wanted to go back to the stickiness-of-inflation question.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,Jean Yung with Market News.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Chair Powell."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,JEAN YUNG.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,Let’s go to Jean Yung.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"But we’ll be looking at it and, and looking at the broad collection of factors."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"I wouldn’t want to—I wouldn’t want to identify any one precise point, because I would be able to look back then and probably find out that it turned out not to be right."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,Do think below 3 percent would be reasonable?
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,JENNIFER SCHONBERGER.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"But if you look at what’s in the—in the SEP, and, you know, I think you’ll see a reasonable estimate of the time lags and things like that that it would take."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,So I can’t give you a precise answer.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, it takes—it takes a while for policy to get into the economy, affect economic activity, and affect inflation."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mean, you’d want to be reducing restriction on the economy well before 2 percent because—or before you get to 2 percent so you don’t overshoot, if we think, think of restrictive policy as weighing on economic activity."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mean, the reason you wouldn’t wait to get to 2 percent to cut rates is that policy would be, it would be too late."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"So when looking in the different components of the data, how much closer do you have to get to 2 percent before you consider cutting rates?"
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"On a six- month annual basis, core PCE is running at 2½ percent, though when you look at supercore and shelter, they are, of course, stickier."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"As you mentioned, PCE inflation is now running at 3½ on core."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,You said back in July that you needed to start cutting rates before getting to 2 percent inflation.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,Jennifer Schonberger with Yahoo Finance.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you, Chair Powell."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,Let’s go to Jennifer.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"As we—as we make decisions about policy changes going forward, we’re going to be looking at all those things and, particularly, about the—as they affect the outlook."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,That could mean we need to keep rates higher for longer.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"Growth is one thing, so is inflation, so is labor market data."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"So that’s—when you get to that question, and that’s your answer, there’s a natural—naturally, it begins to be the next question, which is when it will become appropriate to begin dialing back the amount of policy restraint that’s in place."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"People generally think that we’re at or near that and, and think it’s not likely that we will hike, although they don’t take that possibility off the table."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’re, we’re very focused on that, as I—as I mentioned."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,And that’s really the question that we’re still on here.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"The second question is, you know, really, how high to raise the policy rate?"
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"When we started out, right, we said the first question is, how fast to move, and we moved very fast."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"So the way— the way we’re looking at it is, is really this."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,But I’ll—but I’ll try to answer your question more broadly.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, of course, I don’t comment on, on any other officials, even those who work at the Fed."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you, sir."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"I wonder if you could comment on whether you agree with Fed Governor Waller on that, that the Fed would become more restrictive if it didn’t cut rates if inflation fell."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"Fed Governor Chris Waller said that if inflation continues to fall, then the Fed in the next several months could be cutting interest rates."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"So that’s really the next question, and that’s what people are thinking about and, and talking about."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"Happy holidays, Mr. Chairman."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,STEVE LIESMAN.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,Steve.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,So that’s really what we were thinking.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,But participants also didn’t want to take the possibility of further hikes off the table.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"Participants didn’t write down additional hikes that we believe are likely, so that’s what we wrote down."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we added the word “any” as an acknowledgement that we believe that we are likely at or near the, the peak rate for this cycle."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"So—specifically on “any”: We do say that “in determining the extent of any additional policy firming that may be appropriate,” so “any additional policy firming”—that sentence."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mean, does that mean that you’re pretty much done with rate hikes and the Committee has shifted away from a tightening bias and toward a more neutral stance?"
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,firming” in the statement?
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"Steve Liesman, CNBC."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,And I would just say this.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"We are seeing, you know, strong growth that is—that appears to be moderating; we’re seeing a labor market that is coming back into balance by so many measures; and we’re seeing inflation making real progress."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,These are the things we’ve been wanting to see.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,Rachel Siegel from the Washington Post.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Chair Powell."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,RACHEL SIEGEL.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,Let’s go to Rachel.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,STEVE LIESMAN.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,But that’s generally what happened today.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,I can’t do the head count for you in real time.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"That, that’s really what happened in today’s meeting."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"And then, and I would say, there’s a general expectation that this will be—this will be a topic for us, looking ahead."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"Not everybody did that, but many people did."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"And there was no back-and-forth, no attempt to sort of reach agreement like, “This is what I wrote down; this is what I think,” that kind of thing, and a preliminary kind of a discussion like that."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,So many people mentioned what their—what their rate forecast was.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,Everybody wrote down an SEP forecast.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"So it, it comes up in this way today."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,Sure.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,Can you give some color as to the nature of that discussion today?
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,STEVE LIESMAN.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, of course, the other question, the question of when will it become appropriate to begin dialing back the amount of policy restraint in place, that, that begins to come into view and is clearly a discussion—topic of discussion out in the world and also a discussion for us at our meeting today."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"And that’s, that’s really the question that we’re on."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we’re, we’re moving carefully in making that assessment of whether we need to do more or not."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,And we can’t be guaranteed of this progress [continuing].
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,That would be premature.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,No one is declaring victory.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,We still have a ways to go.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,We can’t know.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"I wanted to ask, how should we interpret the addition of the word “any” before “additional ."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,Chris Rugaber at Associated Press.

2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"Although the jobs-to-workers gap has narrowed, labor demand still exceeds the supply of available workers."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"Nominal wage growth appears to be easing, and job vacancies have declined."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"The labor force participation rate has moved up since last year, particularly for individuals aged 25 to 54 years, and immigration has returned to pre-pandemic levels."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,Strong job creation has been accompanied by an increase in the supply of workers.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,The unemployment rate remains low at 3.7 percent.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"Over the past three months, payroll job gains averaged 204,000 jobs per month, a strong pace that is nevertheless below that seen earlier in the year."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"The labor market remains tight, but supply and demand conditions continue to come into better balance."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"In our Summary of Economic Projections (SEP), Committee participants revised up their assessments of GDP growth this year but expect growth to cool, with the median projection falling to 1.4 percent next year."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,Higher interest rates also appear to be weighing on business fixed investment.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"After picking somewhat over the—up somewhat over the summer, activity in the housing sector has flattened out and remains well below the levels of a year ago, largely reflecting higher mortgage rates."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"Even so, GDP is on track to expand around 2½ percent for the year as a whole, bolstered by strong consumer demand as well as improving supply conditions."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,Recent indicators suggest that growth of economic activity has slowed substantially from the outsized pace seen in the third quarter.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,I will have more to say about monetary policy after briefly reviewing economic developments.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"We will make decisions about the extent of any additional policy firming and how long policy will remain restrictive based on the totality of the incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"Given how far we have come, along with the uncertainties and risks that we face, the Committee is proceeding carefully."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"Today, we decided to leave our policy interest rate unchanged and to continue to reduce our securities holdings."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"Our actions have moved our policy rate well into restrictive territory, meaning that tight policy is putting downward pressure on economic activity and inflation, and the full effects of our tightening likely have not yet been felt."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,We’ve raised our policy interest rate by 5¼ percentage points and have continued to reduce our securities holdings at a brisk pace.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"Since early last year, the FOMC has significantly tightened the stance of monetary policy."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,Restoring price stability is essential to achieve a sustained period of strong labor market conditions that benefit all.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"As we look ahead to next year, I want to assure the American people that we’re fully committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent goal."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"But inflation is still too high, ongoing progress in bringing it down is not assured, and the path forward is uncertain."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s very good news.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"Inflation has eased from its highs, and this has come without a significant increase in unemployment."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"As we approach the end of the year, it’s natural to look back on the progress that has been made toward our dual-mandate objectives."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,My colleagues and I remain squarely focused on our dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,Good afternoon.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"Transcript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference December 13, 2023 CHAIR POWELL."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we’d, we’d look at the totality."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"FOMC participants expect the rebalancing in the labor market to continue, easing upward pressures on inflation."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks for taking our questions.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,The median unemployment rate projection in the SEP rises somewhat from 3.8 percent at the end of this year to 4.1 percent at the end of next year.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"Based on the consumer price index and other data, we estimate that total PCE prices rose 2.6 percent over the 12 months ending in November and that, excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 3.1 percent."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,CHRISTOPHER RUGABER.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,Let’s go to Chris Rugaber.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,I look forward to your questions.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum-employment and price-stability goals.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,Everything we do is in service to our public mission.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"To conclude: We understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,Restoring price stability is essential to set the stage for achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the longer run.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,We remain committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal and to keeping longer- term inflation expectations well anchored.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"In determining the extent of any additional policy firming that may be appropriate to return inflation to 2 percent over time, the Committee will take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial developments."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"We will continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting, based on the totality of the incoming data and their implications for the outlook for economic activity and inflation, as well as the balance of risks."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"These projections are not a Committee decision or plan; if the economy does not evolve as projected, the path of policy will adjust as appropriate to foster our maximum-employment and price-stability goals."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"If the economy evolves as projected, the median participant projects that the appropriate level of the federal funds rate will be 4.6 percent at the end of 2024, 3.6 percent at the end of 2025, and 2.9 percent at the end of 2026, still above the median longer-term rate."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"While participants do not view it as likely to be appropriate to raise interest rates further, neither do they want to take the possibility off the table."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"In our SEP, FOMC participants wrote down their individual assessments of an appropriate path for the federal funds rate based on what each participant judges to be the most likely scenario going forward."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,We’re committed to achieving a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation sustainably down to 2 percent over time and to keeping policy restrictive until we’re confident that inflation is on a path to that objective.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,We are prepared to tighten policy further if appropriate.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"While we believe that our policy rate is likely at or near its peak for this tightening cycle, the economy has surprised forecasters in many ways since the pandemic, and ongoing progress—sorry—ongoing progress toward our 2 percent inflation objective is not assured."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,The Committee decided at today’s meeting to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 5¼ to 5½ percent and to continue the process of significantly reducing our securities holdings.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,Our restrictive stance of monetary policy is putting downward pressure on economic activity and inflation.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"As I noted earlier, since early last year, we have raised our policy rate by 5¼ percentage points, and we have decreased our securities holdings by more than $1 trillion."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"We are highly, highly attentive to the risks that high inflation poses to both sides of our mandate, and we are strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent objective."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"My colleagues and I are acutely aware that high inflation imposes significant hardship, as it erodes purchasing power, especially for those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,The Fed’s monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"The median projection in the SEP is 2.8 percent this year, falls to 2.4 percent next year, and reaches 2 percent in 2026."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"As is evident from the SEP, we anticipate that the process of getting inflation all the way to 2 percent will take some time."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"Longer-term inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters, as well as measures from financial markets."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"The lower inflation readings over the past several months are welcome, but we will need to see further evidence to build confidence that inflation is moving down sustainably toward our goal."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,Inflation has eased over the past year but remains above our longer-run goal of 2 percent.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"At this point, can you confidently say that the economy has avoided a recession and isn’t heading for one now?"
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"In light of the uncertainties and risks, and how far we have come, the Committee is proceeding carefully."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, in the long run, it’s important that financial conditions become aligned or are aligned with what we’re trying to accomplish, and, in the long run, they will be, of course, because we will do what it takes to get to our goals."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"But in any case, we have to do what we think is right."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"And people are going to have different forecasts about the economy, and they’re going to—those are going to show up in market conditions, or they won’t, you know."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, and what I would just say is that we, we focus on what we have to do and how we need to use our tools to achieve our goals, and that’s what we really focus on."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"So this last year has been remarkable for the, the sort of seesaw thing, the back-and-forth we’ve had over the course of the year of markets moving away and moving back and that kind of thing."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,Is this something that you are broadly comfortable with?
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"The market is now easing policy on your behalf by anticipating a funds rate by next September that’s a full point below the current level, with cuts beginning around March."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"Chair Powell, you’ve argued over the last year that policy tightening started before you actually lifted off because the market anticipated your moves and tightened on your behalf."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,NICK TIMIRAOS.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,Nick.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, ultimately, that will mean that financial conditions will, will come along."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"But that’s another assessment that we’re going to make very carefully, so as time goes forward."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"So that’s, that’s how we’re—that’s how we’re approaching things."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"Nonetheless, it’s not the base case anymore, obviously, as it was, you know, 60, 90 days ago."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"That’s, that’s us thinking that we have done enough but not, not feeling that really strongly, confidently and not wanting to take the possibility of a rate hike off the table."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,And you see that people are not writing down rate hikes.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"One of the things we’re moving carefully about is that decision over—that assessment, really—over whether, whether we’ve done enough, really."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,So I mentioned we’re moving carefully.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s what we’ll always do.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,We’ll do the things that we think are right for the economy at the time we—when we think is the right time.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"We have to think, what’s the right thing?"
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"The minute we start thinking about those things—you know, we just can’t do that."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,We think about what’s the right thing to do for the economy.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,We don’t think about politics.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"No, we—we’re—we don’t think about political events."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, and, you know, as I mentioned, we wrote down this SEP, and it talks about—people have individual assessments of when it will be appropriate to, you know, to start to dial back on, on the tight policy we have in place, and that’s a discussion we’ll be having going forward."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"But in the meantime, there can be back-and-forth, and, you know, I’m just focused on what’s the right thing for us to do."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"And my colleagues are focused on that, too."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,NICK TIMIRAOS.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we’ll, we’ll look at the totality of the data."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"And if the answer is “no,” I’m curious about what you’d still be looking for."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"Or, put another way, is below-trend growth necessary to cut rates, or would continued progress on inflation alone be sufficient?"
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"If growth were to surprise us again in the way that it has for years now by being stronger than expected next year, would it still be possible to cut rates?"
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"In the SEP from today, [real GDP] growth is notably below potential in 2024."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks for taking our questions.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"Jeanna Smialek, New York Times."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,JEANNA SMIALEK.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,Jeanna.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’ve seen the economy move in surprising directions, so we’re just going to need to see more further progress."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’re pleased with the progress, but, but we see the need for further progress, and I think—I think it’s fair to say there is a lot of uncertainty about going forward."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"As I mentioned, we’re moving carefully at this point."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we’re very focused on, on, you know, doing that."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"And that—it’s one of our two jobs, along with maximum employment, and they’re equal."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, you know, our—it’s our job to restore price stability."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"That’s, that’s what we need to see."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"We need to see, you know, continued further, further progress toward getting back to 2 percent."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,We just need to see more.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s great.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"That isn’t to say— I’m not, you know, calling into question the progress."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"You’re actually above 3 percent on core, through November, PCE [inflation]."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"If you look at 12-month measures, you’re still well above 2 percent."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think if you look at the 12-month—look at the 6-month measures, you see very low numbers."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"Listen, I welcome the progress."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,Do you believe we’re at the point where inflation is coming down credibly?
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,The markets seem to think inflation is coming down credibly.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,Yeah.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think it’s, it’s really good to see the progress that we’re making."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"I’m wondering, just related to, to Steve’s question, how the—how the tactics of this play out given the slowing of inflation and the fact that the deeper you get into 2024, the closer you get to a presidential election."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,We’re still at 3.7 percent.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,It didn’t really happen.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"If you look back at the SEP from a year ago, there was a significant increase in, in unemployment."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I would say the labor market, because of the stronger growth, has also been significantly better."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think the inflation forecast is roughly, roughly what people wrote down a year ago, but in a very different setting."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,So that was a surprise to just about everybody.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we had significant supply-side gains with strong demand, and we got what looks like a 2½ percent-plus, or a little more than that, growth year at a time when potential growth this year might even have been higher than that, just because of the healing on the supply side."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"So this was the year when labor force participation picked up, where immigration picked up, where the distortions to supply and demand from the pandemic—you know, the shortages and the bottlenecks—really began to unwind."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"And not only did that not happen—that includes Fed forecasters and really, essentially, all forecasters; a very high proportion of forecasters predicted very weak growth or a recession—not only did that not happen, we actually had a very strong year, and that was a combination of, of strong demand but also of real gains on the supply side."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I think forecasters generally, if you go back a year, were very broadly forecasting a recession for this year, for 2023."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"I’m curious, if you’re looking back on the past year, you talked about “navigating by the stars under cloudy skies.” Can you talk about some of the ways in which the economy surprised you most this year, where you thought it would behave in one way and had to pivot to respond?"
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,RACHEL SIEGEL.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,It has done that repeatedly through the post—in the post-pandemic period.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s certainly possible that, that the economy will behave in an unexpected way."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,And there are certainly risks.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,It is—it is far too early to declare victory.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,This result is not guaranteed.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"That’s what many forecasters, on and off the Committee, are seeing."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"So far, that’s what we’re seeing."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"I have always felt, since the beginning, that there was a possibility, because of the unusual situation, that the economy could cool off in a way that enabled inflation to come down without the kind of large job losses that have often been associated with high inflation and tightening cycles."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"The question is, is it—so it’s a possibility here."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,So it’s always a real possibility.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think there’s, there’s always a probability that, that there will be a recession in the next year, and it’s a meaningful probability no matter what the economy is doing."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,I would say that.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"Do you want to front-load this, in other words?"
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,I think you can say that there’s little basis for thinking that the economy is in a recession now.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we’ve seen, you know, strong growth, still a tight labor market but one that’s coming back into balance with the—with support from the supply side, a greater supply of labor."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s a—you know, that’s, that’s what we see, and I think that combination was, was not anticipated broadly."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"Nonetheless, where we are is, is we see the things that I—that I mentioned."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,Howard.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, indeed, if you look at the projections, I think the expectation would be that the real rate is declining as we—as we move forward."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"It sounds like the discussion—if I could follow up—has, has already kind of begun."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"So you couldn’t follow that like it was a rule and think that you would get the right answer all the time, but it’s certainly something that we’re focused on."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, as you well know, it’s so hard to know exactly, you know, what the—what the real rate is or exactly how tight policy is at any given time."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, really, it’s broader financial conditions that matter."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, that’s—that is—that is something that we’re very conscious of, and aware of, and monitor, and it’s certainly a big part of—it’s a part of how we think about things."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,Yes.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,HOWARD SCHNEIDER.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"And so it’s not—it isn’t—you ask about real rates, I take it?"
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"We tabulate them and, and publish it."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"But so I think that people look at that, and they write down their—basically, each individual writes down a forecast and a rate forecast that goes with that forecast."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"You’re seeing so many of the indicators coming back to normal, not all of them."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,HOWARD SCHNEIDER.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we’ve got—we’ve had several labor market reports, which suggest, again, significant progress toward greater balance across a very—a broad range of indicators."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"Howard Schneider with Reuters, and thanks for taking the questions."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"I, I wonder if you could give a little more color or detail on what—on what motivates the lower rates next year, whether it’s a coincidence, for example, that the spread between PCE inflation, core inflation, and the federal funds rate stays constant over the year."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"Are you simply calibrating against the fall in prices, in the price level that you’re expecting, in the rate of inflation that you’re expecting as opposed to supporting the economy?"
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,Nothing quite that mechanical is happening.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"The SEP really is, is a bottoms-up—built from the bottom up, right?"
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,HOWARD SCHNEIDER.
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I think if you look at the big difference from September in the SEP, [it is that] the expectations for inflation this year, both headline and core, have come down, you know, really significantly in three months."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"That’s a big piece of, of this."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"At the same time, [real GDP] growth has turned out to be very strong in the third quarter."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,"[Now it] is slowing, we believe, as, as appropriate."
2023-12-13,Press Conf - Full Text,So I think people are looking at what’s happening in the economy.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Right.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"It would take—you know, people talk about AI, but I would—my guess is that we may shake out and be back where we were, because I don’t—I’m not sure I see—work from home doesn’t seem like it’s a big productivity increase."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,What would it take?
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"Or AI, artificial intelligence— generative it may be, but probably not in the short run—probably, maybe in the longer run."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,I don’t know.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I’m not—I’m not seeing why it would, but, you know, right—you know, right now I would say that productivity is kind of what falls out of the, the broader forces that are driving people in and out of the labor force and, and activity returning and supply chains getting fixed."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,VICTORIA GUIDA.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Chair Powell."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s one way to look at it.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Yeah.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Nancy Marshall-Genzer with Marketplace.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Nancy.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"So would that be behind why we’ve seen such strong growth, but we’ve also seen inflation fall—that maybe there’s just a higher level of productivity?"
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,And I don’t know.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, you’ve mentioned multiple times about, you know, the level of wage growth that’s consistent with 2 percent inflation."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"And the question will be, what, what is it that has changed the—you know, the productivity tends to be based on, you know, fundamental aspects of our economy."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Victoria.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,VICTORIA GUIDA.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,I want to ask a little bit more about housing.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Hi.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Victoria Guida with Politico.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Could you talk a little bit more about productivity growth?
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’ve obviously seen, you know—you were talking about ECI this morning, in which it’s cooled a little bit but still sort of above what you wanted to see."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Growth has been very strong.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,How much of those numbers do you attribute to productivity?
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"And do you see that productivity as sort of just temporary because of the factors—the labor and supply chain factors you were talking about—or do you think that productivity growth will, will fade over time?"
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,So this is a really interesting question.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I think—my, my own view is—I think if you look, look back to the pandemic, you, you saw a spike in productivity as workers were laid off, and, and activity didn’t decline as fast."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,And then you saw a deep trough of productivity.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"And then, over the last—you saw high productivity last year, in ’23."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think we’re, we’re basically in the throes of getting through the pandemic economy."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Is there—is there a case—will it be the case that we come out of this more productive on a sustained basis?
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,I’m wondering—how closely are you watching rent and housing prices as you evaluate whether and when to cut rates?
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Courtenay.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"Price stability is absolutely essential for people’s lives, most importantly for—well, not most importantly—most, mostly for people at the lower end of the income spectrum who are living at the edges—at the margins."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"And so someone—for someone like that, high inflation in the—in the necessities of life—right away, you’re in trouble, whereas even middle-class people have some, you know, some scope to absorb higher costs."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,So we have to get—it’s our job.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s what society has asked us to do, is to get inflation down, and the tools that we use to do it are interest rates."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,So that’s how we think about that.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,COURTENAY BROWN.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"My response is what I started with, which is that our, our job—the job Congress has given us is price stability and maximum employment."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Courtenay Brown from Axios.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Yes.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,So I would start by saying that balance sheet runoff so far has gone very well.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"And as the process has continued, you know, we’re getting to that time where questions are beginning to come into greater focus about the pace of runoff and all that."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"So at this meeting, we did have some discussion of the balance sheet, and we’re planning to begin in- depth discussions of balance sheet issues at our next meeting in March."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s the— that’s really the only way we can do this.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"So those, those questions are all coming into scope now, and we’re focusing on them."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Can you give us some insight into whether the Committee discussed the possibility of slowing balance sheet runoff in the months ahead?
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,And just real quick—what is your response to the letter that was sent to you by some members of Congress asking the Fed to lower interest rates to make housing more affordable?
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"So when we think about, you know—our, our statutory goals are maximum employment and price stability, and that’s what we’re targeting."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’re not targeting housing price inflation, the cost of housing, or any of those things."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Those are very important things for people’s lives.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"But they’re not—you know, those are not the things we’re targeting."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’re also well aware that when we cut rates at the beginning of the pandemic, for example, the housing, housing industry was helped more than any other industry."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"And when we raise rates, the housing industry can be hurt, because it’s a very interest-sensitive sector."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"On top of that, we have longer-run problems with the availability of housing."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, we have a, a built-up set of cities, and, and, you know, people are moving further and further out."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,So there’s—there hasn’t been enough housing built.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,And these are not—these are not things that we have any tools to address.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, you know, where it comes into play very specifically in our work is inflation, which is a combination."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s, it’s really rental inflation."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,You’re taking owners’ equivalent rent and then actual rent paid by tenants.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"And you’re, you’re running that through the CPI calculation."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Or the PCE [inflation] calculation—the one we look at.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,And what that’s telling you is that market rents are increasing at a much lower rate or even being flat and that that will show up in inflation over time.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,It has to as long as that remains the case.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,And it seems like housing prices are not coming down as quickly as you expected.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,So we’re just—we’re just going to be reacting to the data.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, how to—your first question—how to describe where we are?"
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"And that would be a weakening in the labor market or, for that matter, very, very persuasive lower inflation."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,That hasn’t happened in 50 years.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,So it’s a good labor market.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,And we’ve seen inflation come down.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,We’ve talked about that.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,So we’ve got six months of good inflation data and an expectation that there’s more to come.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,So this is a—this is a good situation.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Let’s be honest.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’ve had just about two years now of, of unemployment under 4 percent."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,This is a—this is a good economy.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s looking in the rearview—the outlook—we do expect growth to moderate.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"Of course, we have expected it for some time, and it hasn’t happened, but we do expect that it will moderate as supply chain and labor market normalization runs its course."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"The labor market is rebalancing, as, as I mentioned."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Job creation has slowed.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,The base of job growth has narrowed.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, of course, 12-month inflation is, is above target and getting, you know, getting down closer to target."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s not guaranteed, but we do seem to be getting on track for that."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,But what’s the outlook?
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"So those are the risks and, and questions we have to answer."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,The labor market—3.7 percent unemployment indicates that the labor market is strong.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"But we’re, we’re at the beginning of that process, I would say."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Is that something you’re watching as well?
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"And if, if we see those revisions fairly minor, is that going to give you more confidence where things are going?"
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,We’ll just have to see.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Yeah.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,We’ll—we look at those.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,So I guess I would just say this—executive summary would be that growth is solid to strong over the course of last year.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"Last year was a—was a, a surprise."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Mike.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHAEL MCKEE.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"Michael McKee, Bloomberg Radio and Television."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"If you don’t want to use the term “soft landing,” would you say, at least, that, from your point of view now, the other scenario of a hard landing caused by the Fed is off the table or the risks have diminished very much?"
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"And you mentioned below–2 percent inflation for—on a three-month basis, core PCE has been running at 1½ percent."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"And there are those on Wall Street who think that if you maintain the level of restriction you have right now, you could end up with inflation running below your target."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,How do you see that?
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, overall, this is a pretty good picture."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"It, it is a good picture."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Your second question was—sorry.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,We’re going to be looking at this meeting by meeting.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"Based on the meeting today, I would tell you that I don’t think it’s likely that the Committee will reach a level of confidence by the time of the March meeting to identify March as the time to do that."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"But that’s, that’s to be seen."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I wouldn’t call—you know, when you say—when you ask me about “in the near term,” I’m hearing that as March."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"I would say I don’t think that’s—that’s, that’s probably not the most likely case or what we would call the base case."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,And your second question is— EDWARD LAWRENCE.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"On, on the—is this the start of a—when we see a cut, is it the start of a cutting cycle, or is it—could it just be a one-off?"
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"So if you take that to the current context—current context, we’re going to be data dependent."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"The whole thing is, this is going to depend on the data."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,We’re going to be looking at the economic data as it affects the outlook and the balance of risks.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,And we’re going to make our decisions based on that.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"And it could wind up—you know, we’ll, we’ll have another SEP at the March meeting, and, and people will write down what they think."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, in the end, it’s really going to depend on how the economy evolves."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"We talked about, there are risks that would cause us to go slower—for example, stronger inflation—more, more persistent inflation."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,There are risks that would cause us to—if they happen—that would cause us to go faster or—and sooner.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, that’s going to depend on the data."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"We, we included that language in the statement to signal clearly that—with strong growth, strong labor market, inflation coming down—the Committee intends to move carefully as we consider when to begin to dial back the restrictive stance that we have in place."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,So I’ll point you to that language on your first question.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHAEL MCKEE.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"Could you get inflation that is below target—end up with inflation below target, and you have to do something about that?"
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we—the thing is, we’re not looking for inflation to tap the 2 percent base once."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,We’re looking for it to settle out over time at 2 percent.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"And the same thing is true if we have a month or two of lower—and we have that now—of, of inflation that’s annualized at a—at a lower level—that wouldn’t be good."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’re not—you know, we’re not looking to have inflation anchor below 2 percent."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,We’re looking to have it anchor at 2 percent.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"So if we do face those circumstances, then we’ll have to deal with that."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think—I think as of now, you know, the, the question, which—we want to take advantage of this situation and finish the job on inflation while keeping the labor market strong."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Edward.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,EDWARD LAWRENCE.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Edward Lawrence from Fox Business.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for taking this."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, as I’ve—as I’ve heard from some District Fed presidents, is it, in your view, a little premature to think that rate cuts are right around the corner?"
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"And then when we do see that first rate cut, is that—should we interpret that as the beginning of a rate-cut cycle, or is it a one-off?"
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Those are the kinds of things.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,COURTENAY BROWN.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"In all their Districts, they’re talking to, you know, not just the business community, but the educational, medical, all, all—you know, nonprofit community."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"In, in recent, recent surveys, a couple of—you’ve seen a couple of significant increases in, in consumer confidence or, or happiness with the economy."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,I guess that’s a good thing.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,That can—that can support spending—can support economic activity.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,There’s some evidence of that.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"But it is—it is a fact that we have seen, you know, a meaningful increase."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,I think levels of confidence are still maybe not as high as they’ve been at various times.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you very much.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,In terms of [surveys]—you’re right.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,But it’s—they certainly have come up.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Bryan.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,BRYAN MENA.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you for taking our questions.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"Bryan Mena, CNN Business."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"Committee members have said they’d like to meet with business leaders and stakeholders in person to learn more about the economy in real time, given that some data is subject to large revisions, the issue of seasonal adjustments being thrown off balance, and many readings of the economy being quarterly."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,So did any members say they’ve learned anything not reflected in the data?
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Or have you yourself learned anything through anecdotal evidence that hasn’t been captured in the data yet?
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s why we need to do our jobs—so that people don’t have to deal with things like this.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"And they’re, they’re right to be unhappy."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,I just wondered if I could get your comment on the recent consumer confidence data.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,It seems to suggest that consumers are sort of moving towards a much more optimistic view of the economy.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,I just wonder—is it fair to say that they’re moving towards where the Fed appears to have been in recent months?
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, do you think that inflation and falling inflation perhaps has played a role in that?"
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"And what challenges do you see, going forward?"
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, this is why we need to keep price stability."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"Yeah, so it’s been—it’s been interesting that confidence surveys have been weak, at a time when unemployment has been low—very low, historically low—for a couple of years."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,And we’ve asked ourselves why that is.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, one obvious answer—we don’t pretend to have perfect wisdom on this—is—but one obvious answer is that the price level is high."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,So prices went up much more than 2 percent for year—per year for a couple of years.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"And people are going to the store, and they’re paying much more for the basics of life than they were two years ago—three years ago."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,And they’re not happy about it.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"And it’s fine that inflation is coming down, but the price—the prices they’re paying are still high."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"So that, that is what—that, that has to be some part of why people are unhappy."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"And—but, nonetheless, that’s been the case."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"Well, yes."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"I’m, I’m a big believer that—yes."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we, we do meet with outside groups who come from all different parts of the economy."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,JEFF COX.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you, sir."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Jeff Cox from CNBC.com.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"Just kind of looking to put it all together: You talked about basically the, the economy looking strong with 3.3 percent annualized growth in the fourth quarter."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Does the strength of the economy speak more loudly to you now than any inflation threat might?
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"That, you know—you’re in a position, in other words, to keep rates elevated as long as the economy stays strong, and you’re more—you’re more tilted towards that."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"And also, perhaps, are you worried at all that the economy is maybe a little too strong right now and that inflation could come back at some point?"
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Let’s go to Jeff Cox for the last question.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, it’s—again, we’ve had inflation come down without a slow economy and without, you know, important increases in, in unemployment, and there’s no reason why we should want to get in the way of that process, if it’s going to continue."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I, I am—you know, I think—I think declining inflation—continued declines in inflation are, are really the main thing we’re looking at."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"Of course, we want the labor market to remain strong, too."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,We don’t have a growth mandate.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’ve got a, a maximum-employment mandate and a, a price-stability mandate, and those are the two things we look at."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Growth only matters to the extent it influences our achievement of those two—of those two mandates.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,And just one quick follow-up—Governor Waller had mentioned the revisions that are coming on February 9th for the CPI data.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,I’m not so worried about that.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,So that’s what comes through.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"You’re hearing—not, not in every District and not every, every person that we talk to, but you’re—overall, it feels like you’re hearing things picking up at the margin."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I always feel like you—I mean, I spent most of my life in the private sector looking at companies—individual companies—individual management teams—and then building out from that."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"And so, starting with GDP data is—and working into what’s actually affecting people’s lives is—is challenging."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s very hard.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I, I really like anecdotal data."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"In addition, as you know, the 12 Reserve Banks have really the best network of anyone."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,They have arms into all of that.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,And so when they come back—that’s what goes into the Beige Book.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"But they come back, and what each Reserve Bank president does is, during the outlook go-around, they’ll say, “In my District ."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,".” And they’ll talk about 100 conversations they—not—they won’t talk—they, they will give you input, based on 100 conversations that they’ve had with people of all different walks."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,And it’s—I personally find it very helpful in understanding what’s going on.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"And also, I think you hear things before they show up in the data sometimes."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,BRYAN MENA.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"Did any of them—did any of them notice slowing economy based on what they’ve heard from, like, their District?"
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Yes.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mean, if you—if you look back at the last—not this Beige Book, but the one before, it was more—there was a lot of “slower activity.” I think that, that what you’re hearing now is, is, things are picking up a bit."

2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"We think that’s the best way we can serve the public, because, ultimately, we, we’ve made a lot of progress on inflation."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,We just want to make sure that we do get the job done in a sustainable way.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s how we’re thinking about it.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"In terms of when that’ll be, you know, that, that’ll all come out of our communications, and, you know, we won’t—we won’t keep that a secret."

2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Can you explain a little bit more on what you’re considering when tapering QT?
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"Do you need to see the overnight reverse repo facility all the way down to zero, or is it something that you can start with a couple hundred billion dollars there?"
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"Not a decision that we’ve made, but I, I wouldn’t think we’d, we’d be—we wouldn’t be taking a position that it’s got to go to zero."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mean, if it—if it were to stabilize at a different level—but that’s, that’s not a decision that we’ve made."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"That’s, that’s what we’ll be talking about at the March meeting."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"A whole range of issues will be briefed up, and the Committee will get into—get into all of the issues that will be arising over the course of the next, let’s say, year or so."

2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"We, we have growing confidence, but not to the point where we—where we feel like—it’s a highly consequential decision to start the process of, of dialing back on restriction."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,I’m just going to say—and it’s not that we don’t have any confidence.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"I’m, I’m not in a position to put a number on it."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"Yes, we do—we see those as independent tools."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"And so they don’t—for example, if you’re—if you’re normalizing policy, you might be reducing rates but continuing to run off the balance sheet."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"In both cases, that’s normalization, but from a strict monetary policy standpoint, you could say we’re loosening along with tightening."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"So that, that could happen."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s not something we’re planning or thinking about, but right now, we’re thinking about getting to a place where—we’re going to see the balance sheet runoff to continue."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’re watching it carefully, and, as I said, we’ll—we’ll be looking into that as a Committee starting in March."

2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you, Chair Powell."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"You’ve mentioned six good months of inflation data, but that not being enough to build up confidence."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"Based on your previous response that your base case is you probably wouldn’t start easing yet in March, the implication is that eight good months might not be enough, either."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"Roughly how many months do you think you might need of, of good inflation data to be—to be confident?"
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Quick follow-up—is it the case that the Fed would decide to lower rates and make adjustments to the balance sheet runoff in tandem?
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Greg.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I—you know, we’re going to do—we’ll update our, our inflation forecasts at the next meeting."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,You referred to the December meeting.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"That’s, that’s, you know, three months old [by March], so it might be lower now, given the data we’ve gotten."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, look, as I mentioned, we’re going to be reacting to the data."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"If, if we get—if we get very strong inflation data and it, it kicks back up, then it’ll—then we’ll go slower or later or both."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"If we got really good inflation data soon, that would matter for both the—that, that would tell us that, that we could go sooner and perhaps go faster."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we’re just going to be—but, of course, we’ll weigh that with all the other factors."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’re setting policy based on the totality of, of the data."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"But just to follow—if inflation stays where it is currently, that would probably mean that the real interest rate becomes more restrictive."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"Would that mean you’d have to trim more, perhaps, than you already have factored in?"
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"Well, I think if we—if we came to the view that, that inflation were—that the six-month inflation numbers, which are very close to 2 [percent], were, in “PCE world”—if we came to—if that’s—if we thought that is really where we’re going to be, then, yes, our policy would be in a different place."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,It would.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, you know, that’s the whole point is, we’re trying to get comfortable and gain confidence that that is where—that inflation is on a sustainable path down to 2 percent or toward 2 percent."

2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"And you guys are actually expecting core inflation higher this year, at 2.4 percent, compared to that six-month measure."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"As you mentioned, core PCE [inflation] has been running at 1.9 percent over the past six months."

2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Do you want another term—you’ve had—on the Fed?
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"What, what’s your stance on that?"

2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s a reasonable assumption that, over time, goods inflation will flatten out—probably approximate zero."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,That would mean the services sectors would have to contribute more.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, in other words, what we care about is the aggregate number—not so much the composition."

2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"Chair Powell, it seems to me you raised rates rapidly over the last two years for two reasons."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,One was the risk of a wage– price spiral.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"Two, there were risks of inflation expectations becoming unanchored."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,This morning’s ECI report for the fourth quarter shows private-sector payroll growth running at a sub–4 percent pace.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Inflation expectations are very close to where they were before the inflation emergency of the last three years.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, given that you appear to have substantially cut off these two tail risks and that you’ve judged here today current policy as well into restrictive territory, what good reason is there to keep policy rates above 5 percent?"
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,NICK TIMIRAOS.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Are you really going to learn more waiting six weeks versus three months from now that you have avoided those two risks?
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,We have six months of good inflation [readings].
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"No, I think it’s—I, I would say it, it seems—it seems to be the likely case that, that we will achieve that confidence, but we have to achieve it, and we haven’t yet."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s just a question of, can we take that with confidence that we’re moving sustainably down to 2 percent?"
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s really what we’re thinking about.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"In terms of, of growth, we’ve had strong growth."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mean, if you take a step back, we’ve had strong growth—very strong growth [in real GDP] last year—going right into the fourth quarter."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"And yet we’ve had a very strong labor market, and we’ve had inflation coming down."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I think—whereas a year ago, we, we were thinking that we needed to see some softening in economic activity—that hasn’t been the case."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I think we, we look at—we look at stronger growth."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"And so—I mean, it’s a good story."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,We don’t look at it as a problem.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,We want to see a strong labor market.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,We’re not looking for a weaker labor market.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’re looking for inflation to continue to come down, as it has been coming down for the last six months."

2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,And I’m sorry.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"If I could just follow up very quickly, the—when, when you say that you want to make sure that it’s a true signal, is there anything that you’re seeing in the data that makes you doubt that it’s a true signal at this stage?"
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think, at this point, we want to see strong growth."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, as you know, almost every participant on the Committee does believe that it will be appropriate to reduce rates and for, for—partly for the reasons that you say."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, we, we feel like inflation is coming down."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,So we’re really in a risk-management mode: of managing the risk—as I mentioned in my opening remarks—managing the risk that we move too soon and move too late.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I think to move, which is—which is where almost everyone on the Committee is—is in favor of, of moving rates down this year—but the timing of that is going to be linked to our gaining confidence that inflation is on a sustainable path down to 2 percent."

2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Hi.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thanks, Chair Powell."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"But that also doesn’t mean that we wait around for—to see, you know, the economy turn down, because that would be too late."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"I’d like you to, to key in on the use of the word in, in the statement that inflation still “remains elevated.” You’ve pledged to cut rates before inflation reached 2 percent."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"Yeah, I, I don’t know that we’ve worked out the particulars— statement language and that kind of thing."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"I would just say, if you look at—you know, look at where, where 12-month inflation is, and it’s, you know, it’s still well above—core is 2.9 percent, for example—12-month—which is way down from where it was."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"Very, very positive development—very fast decline—and, and, you know, the, the case is likely that it will continue to come down."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, so that’s where—that’s where it is."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"But we’re, you know, we’re wanting to see, you know, more data."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,HOWARD SCHNEIDER.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"So that implies that there’s some sort of intermediate step here on, on inflation and that a, a cut would be consequent with a change in the statement language that inflation “remains elevated.” What’s the step-down from there?"
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, in addition, we don’t know with great confidence where the neutral rate of interest is at any given time."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,We look at—broadly—financial conditions.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"It doesn’t mean that at all, because, for one thing, we, we don’t know—we, we look at more than just the fed funds rate."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Growth has been strong.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,The labor market is strong.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,We’re—what we’re trying to do is identify a place where we’re really confident about inflation getting back down to 2 percent so that we can then begin the process of dialing back the restrictive level.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, overall, I think—I think people do believe—and, as you know, the median participant wrote down three rate cuts this year."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"But I think to get to that place where we feel comfortable starting the process, we need some confirmation that inflation is, in fact, coming down sustainably to 2 percent."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,NICK TIMIRAOS.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"If I could ask differently: If, if you hold rates high as inflation moderates, as it—as it has been, target rates will exceed the prescriptions of the Taylor rule or its variants."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,What would be the reasoning for holding rates higher than the levels recommended by those rules in the current instance?
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"Well, I—look, I think, as you know, we consult the range of Taylor rules and, and non-Taylor kind of rules."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,We consult them regularly.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"They’re in our, our Tealbook, and, and they’re in all the materials that we look at."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, you know, I don’t think we’ve ever been at a—at a place where we were—where we were setting policy by them."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"And there—depending on the rule, it will tell you different things."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,There are many different formulations.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"Another way to think about it is, implicitly, is—so, in theory, of course, real rates go up if—holding all else equal—as inflation comes down."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,But that doesn’t mean we can mechanically adjust policy as real rates—sorry—as inflation comes down.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,It is.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, if I—if I could follow up on that, the statement allows that you want greater confidence on inflation falling before you cut, but it doesn’t mention the other side of the mandate—a slide in employment."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,It doesn’t—it’s not that the six-month data isn’t—isn’t low enough.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s the question.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"Over the past three months, payroll job gains averaged 165,000 jobs per month, a pace that is well below that seen a year ago but still strong."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,The unemployment rate remains low at 3.7 percent.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Strong job creation has been accompanied by an increase in the supply of workers.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"The labor force participation rate has moved up, on balance, over the past year, particularly for individuals aged 25 to 54 years, and immigration has returned to pre-pandemic levels."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"Nominal wage growth has been easing, and job vacancies have declined."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"Although the jobs-to-workers gap has narrowed, labor demand still exceeds the supply of available workers."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Inflation has eased notably over the past year but remains above our longer-run goal of 2 percent.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"The labor market remains tight, but supply and demand conditions continue to come into better balance."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"We have to ask [that], and we want to get comfort on that."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,But we will need to see continuing evidence to build confidence that inflation is moving down sustainably toward our goal.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"Longer- term inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters, as well as measures from financial markets."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,The Fed’s monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"My colleagues and I are acutely aware that high inflation imposes significant hardship, as it erodes purchasing power, especially for those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’re highly attentive to the risks that high inflation poses to both sides of our mandate, and we’re strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent objective."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"Over the past two years, we have raised our policy rate by 5¼ percentage points, and we’ve decreased our securities holdings by more than $1.3 trillion."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Our restrictive stance of monetary policy is putting downward pressure on economic activity and inflation.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,The lower inflation readings over the second half of last year are welcome.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,The Committee decided at today’s meeting to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 5¼ to 5½ percent and to continue the process of significantly reducing our securities holdings.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,High interest rates also appear to have been weighing on business fixed investment.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"For 2023 as a whole, GDP expanded at 3.1 percent, bolstered by strong consumer demand as well as improving supply conditions."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"Transcript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference January 31, 2024 CHAIR POWELL."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Good afternoon.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,My colleagues and I remain squarely focused on our dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,The economy has made good progress toward our dual-mandate objectives.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Inflation has eased from its highs without a significant increase in unemployment.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s very good news.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"But inflation is still too high, ongoing progress in bringing it down is not assured, and the path forward is uncertain."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"Activity in the housing sector was subdued over the past year, largely reflecting high mortgage rates."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,I want to assure the American people that we’re fully committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent goal.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"Today, the FOMC decided to leave our policy interest rate unchanged and to continue to reduce our securities holdings."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"Over the past two years, we’ve significantly tightened the stance of monetary policy."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"Our strong actions have moved our policy rate well into restrictive territory, and we’ve been seeing the effects on economic activity and inflation."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"As labor market tightness has eased and progress on inflation has continued, the risks to achieving our employment and inflation goals are moving into better balance."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"I will have more to say about monetary policy— about monetary policy, after briefly reviewing economic developments."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has been expanding at a solid pace.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,GDP growth in the fourth quarter of last year came in at 3.3 percent.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Restoring price stability is essential to achieve a sustained period of strong labor market conditions that benefit all.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"We believe that our policy rate is likely at its peak for this tightening cycle and that, if the economy evolves broadly as expected, it will likely be appropriate to begin dialing back policy restraint at some point this year."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"But the economy has surprised forecasters in many ways since the pandemic, and ongoing progress toward our 2 percent inflation objective is not assured."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"The economic outlook is uncertain, and we remain highly attentive to inflation risks."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Sorry—say that last part again.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,JEANNA SMIALEK.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"How are—how are you weighing the growth data and consumption data, which have been surprisingly strong, against inflation data?"
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Okay.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, what are we looking for to get greater confidence?"
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"And as you make those decisions, how are you weighing recent strong growth in consumer spending data against the sort of solid inflation progress you’ve been seeing?"
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Let me say that we have confidence.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"Implicitly, we do have confidence, and it has been increasing, but we want to get greater confidence."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,What do we want to see?
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,We want to see more good data.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s not that we’re looking for better data.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s—we’re looking at continuation of the good data that we’ve been seeing, and a good example is inflation."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,So we have six months of good inflation data.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"The question really is, that six months of good inflation data—is it sending us a true signal that we are, in fact, on a path—a sustainable path down to 2 percent inflation?"
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,We’re—we’re looking for greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably down to 2 percent.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,I wonder—what do you need to see at this point to gain that confidence?
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"Obviously, in the statement and just in your remarks there, you note that you don’t want to cut interest rates without greater confidence that inflation is coming—coming down fully."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks for taking our questions.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,We’re prepared to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate for longer if appropriate.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"As labor market tightness has eased and progress on inflation has continued, the risks to achieving our employment and inflation goals are moving into better balance."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,We know that reducing policy restraint too soon or too much could result in a reversal of the progress we’ve seen on inflation and ultimately require even tighter policy to get inflation back to 2 percent.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"At the same time, reducing policy restraint too late or too little could unduly weaken economic activity and employment."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"In considering any adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will carefully assess the incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,The Committee does not expect that it will be appropriate to reduce the target range until it has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2 percent.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,We will continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,We remain committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal and to keeping longer-run—longer-term inflation expectations well anchored.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Restoring price stability is essential to set the stage for achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the longer run.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"To conclude: We understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum-employment and price-stability goals.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,I look forward to our questions.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Jeanna.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,JEANNA SMIALEK.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Jeanna Smialek from the New York Times.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,And the answer will come from some more data that’s also good data.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"Would a slide in employment also bring you to the point of, of cutting rates?"
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"Total PCE prices rose 2.6 percent over the 12 months ending in December; excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 2.9 percent."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Yes.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Rich.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,RICH MILLER.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you—sorry.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thanks for taking the question, Mr. Chairman."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"You mentioned earlier we’re not seeking a weaker labor market, I think you, you said."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Can you talk a little bit more about that?
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I think the question is, when that peters out, I think the, the, you know, the, the restriction will show up probably more, more sharply."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"Do you—do you think the labor market now is back to quote, unquote, “normal” and that the—we can achieve the inflation target without wage gains coming back down to what they were pre-pandemic?"
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"I, I think the labor market by many measures is at or nearing normal—but not totally back to normal."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,And you pointed to one or more of them.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I think, you know, job openings are not quite back to where they were."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"Wages—wage increases, rather, are not quite back to where they—to where they would need to be in the longer run."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"I, I would look at it this way, though."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"The, the economy is broadly normalizing, and so is the labor market."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"Even with today’s ECI levels, they were still above those pre-pandemic levels."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,And that process will probably take some time.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"You’re getting, you know, more activity because of the—of labor market healing and supply chains healing."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"So that, that won’t go on forever."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,You see the effects.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,You do.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"Your, your second question, though, really, I think, is important, and that is, a lot of this has come through—a lot of the disinflationary process has come through the healing of supply chains and also of the labor market."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"So you’ve seen the—you know, that other set of factors is really different from other cycles and has brought that working with tighter, tighter policy, which has enabled the supply side to recover—I think is that, that mixture has been behind what has enabled this."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, no—we really do think that we’re having an effect broadly across the economy."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"I would point to the interest-sensitive parts of the economy as well as spending, generally."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,But it’s a—it’s a joint story.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"So a lot of the growth we’re seeing is not—is—it isn’t just a tug of war between, between interest rates and demand."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s a complicated story.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, but how much restraint are you actually imparting to the economy, would you say, relative to the neutral rate?"
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s—so I think it’s, it’s—of course, you know that it’s not something you can identify with any precision."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"But if you—a standard approach would be to take the nominal rate—5.3 percent, let’s say—and subtract sort of a, a forward measure of inflation."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"If you do that—and there are many, many ways to calculate the neutral rate—but that’s one I like to do."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, you’re going to get to something that is materially above mainstream estimates of neutrality—of the neutral rate—you will."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"And—but at the same time, you look at the economy, and you say, “This is an economy that grew 3.1 percent last year.” And, and you say, “What does that tell you about the neutral rate?” What’s happening, though, is, the supply side has been recovering in the middle of this."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,STEVE LIESMAN.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"So wage setting is something that happens—it’s, it’s—you know, probably will take a couple of years to get all the way back."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,And that’s okay.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s okay.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,I wanted to follow up on Rich’s question.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,And it sounds like you’re saying you’re not worried that solid growth from here on out poses any risk to inflation.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"No, I think that that is a risk—the risk that inflation would, would reaccelerate."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think the, the greater risk is that it would—that it would stabilize at a level meaningfully above 2 percent."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Chris Rugaber at Associated Press."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"That’s, that’s, to me, more likely."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"But I have to tell you, that’s why we keep our options open here and why we’re not, you know, rushing."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I, I think both of those are risks, but I think the more likely risk is the one that I mentioned, which is, you’ve had six good months—very good months—but what, what’s really going to “shake out” here?"
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, where—what will— when we look back, what will we see?"
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"Will, will inflation have dipped and then come back up?"
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Are the last six months flattered by factors that are—that are one-off factors that won’t repeat themselves?
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,We don’t think so.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"Of course, if—if inflation were to surprise by moving back up, that would—we would have to respond to that, and that would— that would be a surprise at this point."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,CHRISTOPHER RUGABER.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Chris.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"But we do see—you saw today’s ECI reading—you know, the evidence is that, that wage increases are still at a healthy level—very healthy level—but they’re gradually moving back to levels that would be more associated—given, given assumptions about productivity, are more typically associated with 2 percent inflation."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s, it’s an ongoing process—a healthy one— and, and, you know, I think we’re, we’re moving in the right direction."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,RICH MILLER.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"So that process can continue without a weakening of the labor market, basically, you’re saying?"
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think the, the labor market is—it—I don’t know if I’d—it’s rebalancing."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"Clearly, that the—there was a fairly severe imbalance between demand for workers and supply at the beginning of the pandemic."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,So we lost several million workers at the beginning of the pandemic from people dropping out of the labor force.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"And then when the economy reopened—you remember 2021—you had a severe labor shortage, and it was just—it was everywhere—panic on the part of businesses—couldn’t, couldn’t find people."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, what’s happened is—we expected labor—the labor supply—labor market to come back quickly, and it didn’t."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"And 2022 was a disappointing year, and, you know, we were kind of thinking, “Well, maybe we won’t get it back.” And then 2023, we did, as you know—so labor force participation came back strongly in ’23, and so did immigration."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Immigration came to a halt during the pandemic.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,So—and so those two forces have significantly lowered the temperature in the labor market to what is still a very strong labor market.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s still a good labor market for wages and for finding a job, but it’s getting back into balance, and that’s what we want to see."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, one great way to look at that is what’s happening with, with wage increases."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"And you see it now across the, the major things that we—that we track."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"It isn’t every quarter, but, overall, there’s a clear trend—still at high levels, but back down to where—what would be consistent with, with where we were before the pandemic and with 2 percent inflation."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"So it’s—I think you, you do see in the interest-sensitive parts of the economy—you do see, for example, housing."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,It sounded like you suggested that you’re not worried about faster growth so much—so wanted to see if you’re seeing anything that suggests that inflation could reaccelerate from here.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"In other words, how much is the economy really being restrained right now by the current funds rate?"
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"I would point you to the [December 2023] SEP as, as, you know, as good evidence of where people are, although it is—it is [now] one [FOMC meeting] cycle later."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, you know, we’re not—we’re not at a place of, of really working out those kinds of details, because we weren’t actively considering, you know, a—moving, moving the federal funds rate down."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"I will say, there is a—there is a wide disparity—a healthy disparity—of views, and you see that in public, public statements, in the minutes, and the transcripts when they’re released every five years."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we do have a healthy set of differences, and I think that’s actually essential for making good policy."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’re also able to reach agreement, generally, because we listen to each other— we, we compromise."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"And even though not everybody loves what we do, they’re able to—for the most part—able to join in."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"To me, that’s a well-functioning public institution."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"Some people did, you know, talk about their view of the rate path."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,RACHEL SIEGEL.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Chair Powell."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Rachel Siegel from the Washington Post.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks for taking our questions.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, over the past few years, there have been all these real-time indicators that helped us gain a sharper understanding of where the economy was, like OpenTable data or office attendance."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,You’ve talked about vacancies in the past.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I’m wondering, at the start of this year, what might be on that dashboard for you that’s giving you the clearest picture of the economy—including on rents—if you could touch on that."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Rachel.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, we’re— we’re—there was no proposal to cut rates."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,So let me say that we’re not looking for that.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"And how much restraint does it really need, additionally, if inflation is still coming down?"
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s not something we’re looking for.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, yes, if you think about, you know—in, in the base case, the economy is performing well—the labor market remains strong."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"If we saw an unexpected weakening in, in—certainly in the labor market, that would certainly weigh on cutting sooner."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Absolutely.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,And if we saw inflation being stickier or higher or those sorts of things—would argue for moving later.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,So we’re not—we’re not really at that stage.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"In the base case, though, where, where the economy is healthy and we have, you know, we have ongoing growth—solid growth—we have a strong labor market—we have inflation coming down—that’s what people are writing their SEP [submissions] around."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Claire.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,CLAIRE JONES.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"Claire Jones, Financial Times."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"Just to circle back to the “greater confidence” aspect of the statement, there’s been a lot of unanimity in recent meetings."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"I’m just wondering, going forward, when it comes to all needing greater confidence, is there unanimity or, at least, consensus among FOMC members about what the threshold for that greater confidence is?"
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"And if not, could you maybe tell us a little bit about the discussion today on, you know, what the variations between FOMC members was on what constitutes enough confidence to cut rates and also if there was any variation on how quickly that “greater confidence” threshold could be reached?"
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Including?
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"And in that case, what we’re saying is, based on that, we think we can and should take advantage of that and, and be careful as we approach that question of when to begin to dial back restriction."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Rent.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,RACHEL SIEGEL.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"I guess, just as a quick follow-up—do you feel comfortable at this point saying the economy has reached a soft landing, or is that part of looking for more confidence?"
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"No, I wouldn’t—I wouldn’t say we’ve achieved that."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I, I think we have—we have a ways to go."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"Inflation is still—you know, core inflation is still well above target on a 12-month basis."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"Twelve months is our, our target, certainly."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we look at the things that relate to our mandate very carefully, and—as you would imagine."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"I’m encouraged, and we’re encouraged by the progress."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,We think we have a ways to go.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Steve.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,STEVE LIESMAN.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,So I’m wondering what you could tell me—how do you believe the neutral rate is working or telling you right now that growth is stronger?
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,RACHEL SIEGEL.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,You’ve said that you would know the neutral rate by its works.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, you know, we’re, we’re not—we’re not declaring victory at all at this point."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’ll find out with, with that."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"In addition, it takes time for the, the healing process to get into prices."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Yeah.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,So there may be still a tailwind.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"Well, so we’re not—you know, it’s not the pandemic, so we can actually rely on more, more traditional forms."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,People are working.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Rent costs.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I wouldn’t say we’re looking at that, that sort of more innovative data as much."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, you point to rents."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, of course, we follow the, the components of inflation very carefully."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"They’re getting wages, and, and the economy has largely reopened and is broadly normalizing, as you see."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"So the question is, when will these lower market rents find their way into measured rents, as measured, measured in PCE inflation?"
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, these—the supply chains are not perfectly back to where they were."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"But at the same time, we think goods inflation will probably—it’s been giving a lot of disinflation to the effort—and probably that declines over time, but it may well have some, some more time to run."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Which would be: Goods inflation—I talked about that a little bit; you mentioned housing inflation.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,So that will—that will help.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"So—but that’s in, in everyone’s forecast, I would say."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s just a question of when and, and how big it’ll be."
2024-01-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we think that’s coming, and we know it’s coming."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"And then it would be very hard to restart, we think."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"And there can be times when, in the aggregate, reserves are ample or even abundant, but not in every part."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Liquidity is not evenly distributed in a system.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"I wouldn’t want to try to be more specific than that, but you get the idea."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"In terms of the timing, I said fairly soon."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,And that’s what we’re looking at.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"And those parts where they’re not ample, there can be stress, and that can cause you to prematurely stop the process to avoid the stress."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"I don’t want to give you a specific number because we haven’t made a—haven’t had an agreement or decision, but that’s the idea."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,And we’re talking about going to a lower pace.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"There isn't much runoff among MBS—in MBS right now, but there is in Treasuries."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,But what we’re really looking at is slowing the pace of runoff.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,We will discuss those in due course.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"The idea is—and this is in our longer-run plans—that we may actually be able to get to a lower level, because we would avoid the kind of frictions that can happen."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"I’m wondering is—when you say fairly soon, does that mean that the Committee would meet about this again in May and a decision could be reached that soon?"
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Would that be cut about in half or something in that nature?
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,You’re at $95 billion of caps right now.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,And I was wondering if you could also just describe the scope of what the Committee is discussing here.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,You mentioned at the beginning of the press conference that the Committee thought it might be appropriate to slow the pace of asset runoff fairly soon.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Steve Matthews with Bloomberg.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,STEVE MATTHEWS.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Steve.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"That’s where I’ll leave it, though."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,So something like that happened in ’19 perhaps.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,But we’re talking about something that’s unexpected.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"That’s just—that’s just people’s forecast, individual forecasts."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,So that is what we’re discussing essentially is—and we’re not discussing all the other many other balance sheet issues.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,So that’s what we’re doing.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"This is our second time in doing this, and I think we’re going to be paying a lot of attention to the things that started to happen and that foreshadowed what eventually happened at the end of that tightening cycle where we wound up in a short[-of-]reserves situation."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,STEVE MATTHEWS.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Hi Chair Powell.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, you know, we do expect the unemployment rate to—the forecast is that it would move up, I think, closer to what we see as the longer-run sustainable level."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,JEAN YUNG.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Let’s go to Jean.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s what we think.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"Well, I think we broadly think that, once [take-up at] the overnight [reverse] repo [facility] stabilizes, either at zero or close to zero, that, as the balance sheet shrinks, we should expect that reserves will decline pretty close to dollar-for-dollar with that."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"Well, is it also because you’re not sure exactly how the reserve supply will react once the overnight reverse repo facility drops near—at zero?"
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,VICTORIA GUIDA.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"We will always be watching the banking system for similar signs, though."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Those sorts of things.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"It isn’t—it wasn’t so much in the banking system as it was around, for example, where federal funds are trading relative to the administered rates and where secured rates are relative to the administered rates."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,And I think now we have a better sense of what are the indicators.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’re looking at what would be a good time and what would be a good structure, and “fairly soon” is words that we use to mean fairly soon."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,And we don’t want to do that again.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"But one of the reasons we’re slowing down—we will soon enough, fairly soon I should say, slow down—is that we want to avoid any, any kind of that turbulence."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, we’ll be watching carefully."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"Do you worry that, as deposits start to shrink, that we could see more turbulence?"
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"Also on the balance sheet, you know, can you talk a little bit about how the outlook for the banking sector might impact your balance sheet plans?"
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Victoria Guida with Politico."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,VICTORIA GUIDA.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Victoria.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"We want to get this, this decision made first and then we can, when the time is right, come back to the other issues."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"I do expect that, once we’re through this, we’ll come back to the other issues about the composition and the maturity and revisit those issues, but it’s, you know, not urgent right now."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"So that—our, our longer-run goal is to return to a balance sheet that is mostly Treasuries."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,And will there be a discussion about returning to an all- Treasuries balance sheet at some point?
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"I wasn’t thinking particularly about the banking- sector turbulence, but we—and we had some indicators the last time."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"And when I say something—I, I use the term “unexpected” weakening of the labor market."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s like, you may not agree with some arguments, but you really want to understand them."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,So—watching it carefully.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,So I treat dissents with real respect as well.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"So you may read a book that takes a position that you have long opposed, just to understand [the position of] that book."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"But—and so I—you know, you respect thoughtful dissents very much."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,We’ve always had dissents.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"Life goes on, and it’s not a problem."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s something that happens.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,People do dissent.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’re a very consensus-oriented organization, and we do try to achieve consensus and, ideally, unanimity."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"As Chair of the FOMC, would you want to see unanimity on the Committee or something close to it, meaning no more than one dissent, before you begin cutting rates?"
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks a lot for the opportunity to ask a question.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"Claire Jones, Financial Times."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.

2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"So that’s—but at the end of the day, we take that on board, but we have to make our judgments, and we have to “stick to our knitting”— which is maximum employment, price stability, supervise and regulate the banks, work on the payment system: the things that we do."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"We listen, again, because we’re talking to the people who, in our system of government, have oversight over our activity."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"We receive these letters with respect, and we write careful responses and address concerns."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"How do these letters affect what you guys are doing, policy-wise?"
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,There was another letter from two dozen lawmakers saying that the higher rates are squeezing the working people.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,EDWARD LAWRENCE.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"That’s how we can best serve the public and leave the other issues, which in many cases are incredibly important, such as those you mentioned, leave those to the people who have responsibility for those."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’re trying to do that in a way that sustains the strong growth we’re seeing, the strong labor market we’re seeing, but allows us to make further progress with inflation."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"In this case, I would say, those are, you know—our mandate is for maximum employment and price stability and the other things that we do, and that’s what we’re trying to accomplish."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,We place a tremendous amount of importance on our engagements with Congress and always treat them with great respect.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Jean Yung with MNI Market News.

2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,SIMON RABINOVITCH.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Simon Rabinovitch with the Economist.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"Of course, initial claims are very, very low and, if anything, have tracked down a little bit."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"So that’s something we’re watching, but we’re not seeing it."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, you do see things like the low— the low hiring rate, and people have made the argument that if, if layoffs were to increase, that would—that would mean that the net would be fairly quick increases in unemployment."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,So the labor market is—it’s in good shape.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Those have both—those surveys have both come down.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,How hard is it—how easy it is to find a worker?
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"And surveys of workers and businesses are always interesting on this: You know, how tight is the—how easy is it to find a job?"
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s job openings and quits.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"In many, many respects, the things are returning more to their state in 2019, which we can think of as normal for this purpose."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"You’re seeing strong wage growth, but wage growth is gradually moderating down to more sustainable levels."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,You’re seeing big increases in supply.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,You’re seeing high job growth.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,The extreme imbalances that we saw in the early parts of the pandemic recovery have mostly been resolved.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I, you know—we follow all the possible stories that are out there about, about there being cracks, but the overall picture really is a strong labor market."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Don’t see it.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,And I don’t see those cracks today.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we, of course, monitor—it’s one of our two goal variables."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,What would constitute that in your books?
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,You talked about a significant deterioration in the labor market being a condition for easing rates.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Are you concerned at all that—notwithstanding the very strong jobs growth—that in fact there may be some cracks appearing in the employment market?
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"Unemployment, though, if you look at the projection for the full year of 4.0 percent, in February, we were already at 3.9 percent, so quite close to the median projection."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"Obviously, inflation is some ways away from target."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Great.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Okay.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,SIMON RABINOVITCH.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Yes.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Can you hear me?
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"We all monitor the labor market very, very carefully."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,I wanted to ask also about the balance sheet.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,MARK HAMRICK.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Does that mean you don’t have to make a decision on when to end QT at this point?
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,We’re very transparent.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think you—I mean, nothing comes to mind as really desperately in need of doing at this moment."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mean, there’s a long list of things that we’ve done."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, we have an annual supervision report, Financial Stability Report."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,We also have done a bunch of other things.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,I wouldn’t want to turn it back.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,I think that’s a good innovation.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, so we went from four press conferences a year to eight, so now every meeting really is “live” now."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"And that—certainly Chairman Bernanke advanced that, Chairman Greenspan did, Chair Yellen did, and I."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,And so it all happens that way and so there’s been a march toward greater and greater transparency.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,They’ll react to the data.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"I generally think—I mean, this movement actually started 30 years ago—30 years ago, when some academics posited that a more transparent central bank, if the public understands your reaction function, the markets will do your work for you."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,And what might that look like?
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,And is there more that you and your colleagues can do on the transparency front?
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"How important is that higher transparency been in your view, both for the proper functioning of the central bank and also in accomplishing your mission?"
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"Mr. Chairman, April 27 will mark the 13th anniversary since a Fed Chairman began holding regular news conferences."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s Mark Hamrick with Bankrate.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Mark.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"That’s, that’s how I would characterize it."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"We do have people who are keeping up with that, as part of the broader payments landscape."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,I just think it’s something we need to be—we need to understand.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"I haven’t at all, in my own mind, made a decision that I think this is something the U.S. should be doing."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,We don’t.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we actually do have people trying to understand things that are—but it’s wrong to say that we’re working on a CBDC and that we’ve secretly got a lab here where we’ve got one, and we’re just going to spring it on Congress at the right moment."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"It has applications in wholesale finance, in the payment system, and so we need—to serve the public—these issues have become very front burner in the last five or six years—we need to be knowledgeable about all that."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"What we are doing, and I think what every major central bank is doing, is we’re trying to stay in the frontiers of what’s going on in digital finance, and it has many, many different areas."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,We have no shortage of FOMC participants speaking to the public through the media.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"And so that channel is full, I would say."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,So I think it’s generally broadly helped and made things better.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,But not every day and in every way.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"Have they—well, first of all, I respect our—you know, in our system of government, it is Congress that has oversight responsibility over the Fed."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, you know, we’re looking for more good data, and we would certainly welcome it."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"And now we have January and February, which I’ve talked about a couple of times."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"We said we needed to see more, and we said it would be bumpy."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"Again, we didn’t overreact to it."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,We got really good inflation data on the second—in the second part of last year.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"We would, of course, love to get great inflation data."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"Well, we’ll just have to see how the data come in."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"But given that you said that PCE for February, 2.8 percent the estimate, and that we have been seeing PCE—core PCE coming down by a tenth of a percent every month, I mean, wouldn’t you be at about 2.4 percent this summer, June, July, to a point where you could cut then?"
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,JENNIFER SCHONBERGER.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,But that’s what I had in mind.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"We didn’t overreact, as I mentioned."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,We had a series of inflation readings over the second half of last year that were really much lower.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we’re just a long, long way from that."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"I also—to the language you mentioned, I, I really pointed out that we had made significant progress over the past year, and what we’re looking for now is confirmation that that progress will continue."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"I said that any number of times, so those were kind of the main part of the message."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"So let me say my main message at that—in those two days of hearings was really that the Committee needs to see more evidence to build our confidence that inflation is moving down sustainably toward our 2 percent goal, and we don’t expect that it will be appropriate to begin to reduce rates until we’re more confident that that is the case."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"What are we to take by those words, “not far?” CHAIR POWELL."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"But when you testified before the Senate a couple weeks ago, you told lawmakers that you are “not far from receiving the confidence needed on inflation to begin cutting rates.” So are you still of that belief or not?"
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"Not to harp too much more on confidence and inflation, but you did say earlier in this press conference that the recent inflation data hasn’t raised anyone’s confidence."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Jennifer Schonberger with Yahoo Finance.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you, Chair Powell."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,JENNIFER SCHONBERGER.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"Let’s go to Jennifer, for the last question."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,[Laughter] MICHELLE SMITH.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Of course not.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"Well, to follow up: Has there ever been a day where you wanted to put that genie back in the bottle somewhat?"
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,MARK HAMRICK.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,We repeated that today in our statement.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Will you—you said that starting the taper sooner could get you to a smaller balance sheet size.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"And it would take legislation by Congress signed by the President to give us the ability to do what we think of as a CBDC, which is really a retail CBDC with the public."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I think we’ve been pretty transparent on this, but I will— I’ll try harder."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,But the most important thing will be the inflation data coming in.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’ll look at the totality of the data, including everything essentially as we make that assessment."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, I mean, of course we’ll also be looking at all the other things that are happening in the economy."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we’re—most importantly, we’re looking at the incoming inflation data and the contents of it and what they’re telling us, so that’ll be—and also the various components—so obviously that’s what we want."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Sure.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Can you just sum up more specifically what data you’re looking at that would give you that confidence?
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"Chair Powell, you said you’re waiting to become more confident that inflation’s getting to your 2 percent goal before you cut rates."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Nancy Marshall-Genzer with Marketplace."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH: Nancy.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we don’t want to, again, find ourselves in a situation where there aren’t reserves, and we have to turn around and buy assets and put reserves back in the banking system the way we did in 2019 and ’20."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"We want to have a cushion, a buffer, because we know that demand for reserves can be very volatile."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,We’re not trying for that.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"And then that ultimately brings you, ideally, in for—brings it into a nice, easy landing at a level that is above—you know, above what we think the lowest possible ample number would be."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Then you have another time where you effectively hold the balance sheet constant and allow nonreserve liabilities to expand.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"So you have a, you know, a slower pace of runoff, which we’ll have fairly soon."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"Then, though, you reach a point ultimately where you stop allowing the balance sheet to run off and you—but then, from that point, there’s another period in which nonreserves—nonreserve liabilities grow organically, like currency, and that also shrinks the reserves at a very slow pace."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’re going to be looking at what these— what’s happening in money markets, in particular—a bunch of different indicators, including the ones I mentioned, to tell us when we’re getting close."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"So there isn’t a— you know, there’s not a dollar amount or a percent of GDP or anything like that where we think we have a really pretty clear understanding of that."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"Are they—right now, we would characterize them as “abundant,” and what we’re aiming for is “ample” and, you know, which is a little bit less than abundant."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"So that’s—in terms of how it ends, we’re going to be monitoring carefully money market conditions and asking ourselves whether they—what they’re telling us about reserves."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"The idea is that, with a smoother transition, you won’t—you’ll run much less risk of kind of liquidity problems, which can grow into shocks, and which can cause you to stop the process prematurely."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,But that’s the idea.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"So it’s sort of ironic that, by going slower, you can get farther."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"And will you be setting up the process for deciding that sooner, or will you wait until we’re close to the end?"
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"Well, are there things that you would give more weight to, like wages?"
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Wages is one thing.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,We don’t—our target is not wages.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Sure.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Can you give us any clarity on what the Fed is doing right now on a digital dollar?
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,But folks like House Majority Whip Tom Emmer have said that the Fed is either actively researching or hiring personnel to study the implications of the CBDC.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’ve been hearing a lot from Republicans in Congress about what the Fed is or isn’t doing in a digital dollar, but I know you have said to Congress that you’re going to wait for approval before the Fed does anything— launches anything."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,I wanted to ask you about central bank digital currency stuff.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Brendan Pedersen with Punchbowl News.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks Chair Powell.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,BRENDAN PEDERSEN.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Brendan.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I think, generally speaking, it does go in the direction of saying, yes, it’s appropriate for us to be careful as we approach this question."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I think, I think—I didn’t hear anyone dismissing it as not information that we should look at or anything like that."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"I guess I’d put it this way: The—if you look at the incoming inflation data that we’ve had for January and February, I think very broadly that suggests that we were right to wait until we’re more confident."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we are not getting ready to—we haven’t proposed—we haven’t come to a conclusion that we should propose, or anything like that, that Congress consider legislation to authorize a digital dollar."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Was there—was there that sense of maybe it’s smart to wait?
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"Chair Powell, could you say at this meeting whether there were more officials who wanted to be careful and go slower than— about rates—than there were at the last meeting?"
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Greg Robb from MarketWatch.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,GREG ROBB.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Let’s go to Greg.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"But we do think that, to get inflation back down to 2 percent sustainably, we’d like to see, you know, continuing gradual movement of wage increases at still high levels but back down to levels that are more sustainable over time."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,That wasn’t really the story.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"We don’t think that—the inflation was not originally caused—we think, I don’t think, by mostly by wages."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,And that’s what we want.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, but they’ve been—wage increases, that’s to say—wage increases have been quite strong, but they’re, they’re gradually coming down to levels that are more sustainable over time."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,But we would look to the fact that wages are still coming in very strong.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s really inflation.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,We want more confidence that inflation is coming down sustainably toward 2 percent.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"I wanted to ask you, you received a letter from—well, the Federal Reserve is an independent body, understanding Congress has oversight over that."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"And will you be able to get overall inflation down to target if housing doesn’t break through quickly, and does that affect the timing for eventual cuts this year?"
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Okay.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,RACHEL SIEGEL.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, again, uncertainty about the exact timing of that."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"There’s a little bit of uncertainty about when that will happen, but there’s real confidence that they will show up eventually over time."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,So I think there’s some confidence that the market rents—lower market rent increases that we’re seeing will show up in measures of housing services inflation over time.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"Does that challenge your assumption about when the shift will finally break through, since it hasn’t at that point?"
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"You and others have been saying that relief on housing inflation is coming, but it still hasn’t shown up meaningfully in the CPI or the PCE."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks for taking our questions.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Rachel Siegel from the Washington Post.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Chair Powell."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,RACHEL SIEGEL.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Rachel.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we’re committed to that outcome, and we will bring it about."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"But we stress “over time.” And so I think we’re, we’re making projections that do show that happening."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"And they should believe that, because that’s what—that’s what will happen over time."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Markets believe we will achieve that goal.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"That is—that is our goal, and we will achieve that goal."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,We’re strongly committed to bringing inflation down to 2 percent over time.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"When you—just to follow up: When you say that you’re willing to either maintain the rate for longer, is—what is the tolerance of the Federal Reserve for inflation coming in above its 2 percent target?"
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,And so— STEVE LIESMAN.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"But nonetheless, we continue to make good progress on bringing inflation down."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"And the inflation data came in a little bit higher is a separate matter, and I think that caused people to write up their inflation."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"What it means is that, you know, we’ve seen incoming—as I pointed out in my opening remarks, we did mark up our growth forecast and so have many other forecasters, so the economy is performing, performing well."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"Well, it doesn’t—no, it doesn’t mean that."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Does it mean more tolerance for higher inflation and less of a willingness to slow the economy to achieve that target?
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,We will get aggregate inflation down to 2 percent over time.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, and I would assume that we’ll continue to see is—we’ll see goods prices coming into a new equilibrium where they’re going down perhaps not as quickly as they had been earlier this year, where housing services inflation will come back down as, as current market rents are suggesting will happen and where nonhousing services will move back down."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,I don’t think that story has changed.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"But I take the two of them together, and I think they haven’t really changed the overall story, which is that of inflation moving down gradually on a sometimes-bumpy road toward 2 percent."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,So it’s not like the January number.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"The February number was high, higher than expectations, but we have it at currently well below 30 basis points core PCE, which is not terribly high."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, nonetheless, we don’t want to be completely dismissive of it."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,There’s reason to think that there could be seasonal effects there.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"But— so I would say the January number, which was very high—the January CPI and PCE numbers were quite high."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"So you need to check yourself on that, and I’ll do that."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,I want to start by being—saying I always try to be careful about dismissing data that we don’t like.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,How much of that inflation that we’ve seen so far this year do you chalk up to one-off calendar adjustment effects following a period of high inflation versus some change in the trend we saw in the second half of last year?
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,NICK TIMIRAOS.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s really what I was thinking.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, fortunately, with the economy growing, with the labor market strong, and with inflation coming down, we can approach that question carefully and let the data speak on that."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,We want to be careful.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"And so, you know, we do see the risks as two-sided, so it is consequential."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"We—we’re in a situation where, you know, if we ease—if we ease too much or too soon, we could see inflation come back, and if we ease too late, we could do unnecessary harm to employment and people’s working lives."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s more—I would put it more in the context of what I said in our— in my opening remarks that the risks are really two-sided here.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"Is that because you anticipate one cut would be followed by one or two more along the lines of the recalibration you made in 2019, which itself was modeled on the mid-cycle adjustment of 1995?"
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"If rates are well above neutral, why would the first cut be highly consequential?"
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Can you reconcile these views for me?
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"At the same time, you said here after the last meeting that the first cut is highly consequential."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"Chair Powell, during your congressional testimony this month, you said that your test for making the first change to interest rates does not require you to be terribly comfortable that inflation is at 2 percent because interest rates are well above neutral."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,NICK TIMIRAOS.

2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Some combination of those three things—and it may be different from the combination we had before the pandemic—will be achieved and will bring inflation back down to 2 percent sustainably.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,We will.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"What should we infer from this notion that, on average, rates were kept the same this year, but inflation is higher and growth is higher."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,They also show somewhat stronger growth.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"Mr. Chairman, the projections show somewhat higher core inflation."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Inflation has eased notably over the past year but remains above our longer-run goal of 2 percent.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,The median unemployment rate projection in the SEP is 4.0 percent at the end of this year and 4.1 percent at the end of next year.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"FOMC participants expect the rebalancing in the labor market to continue, easing upward pressure on inflation."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"Although the jobs-to- workers gap has narrowed, labor demand still exceeds the supply of available workers."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"Nominal wage growth has been easing, and job vacancies have declined."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"Strong job creation has been accompanied by an increase in the supply of workers, reflecting increases in participation among individuals aged 25 to 54 years and a continued strong pace of immigration."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,The unemployment rate has edged up but remains low at 3.9 percent.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"Over the past three months, payroll job gains averaged 265,000 jobs per month."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"The labor market remains relatively tight, but supply and demand conditions continue to come into better balance."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"Participants generally revised up their growth projections since December, reflecting the strength of incoming data, including data on labor supply."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"In our Summary of Economic Projections, Committee participants generally expect GDP growth to slow from last year’s pace, with a median projection of 2.1 percent this year and 2 percent over the next two years."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,High interest rates also appear to have weighed on business fixed investment.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"Activity in the housing sector was subdued over the past year, largely reflecting high mortgage rates."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"For 2023 as a whole, GDP expanded 3.1 percent, bolstered by strong consumer demand as well as improving supply conditions."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,GDP growth in the fourth quarter of last year came in at 3.2 percent.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has been expanding at a solid pace.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,I will have more to say about monetary policy after briefly reviewing economic developments.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"As labor market tightness has eased and progress on inflation has continued, the risks to achieving our employment and inflation goals are moving into better balance."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Our restrictive stance of monetary policy has been putting downward pressure on economic activity and inflation.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"Today, the FOMC decided to leave our policy interest rate unchanged and to continue to reduce our securities holdings."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Restoring price stability is essential to achieve a sustainably strong labor market that benefits all.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,We are fully committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent goal.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"But inflation is still too high, ongoing progress in bringing it down is not assured, and the path forward is uncertain."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"Inflation has eased substantially while the labor market has remained strong, and that is very good news."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,The economy has made considerable progress toward our dual-mandate objectives.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,My colleagues and I remain squarely focused on our dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Good afternoon.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"Transcript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference March 20, 2024 CHAIR POWELL."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"You received a letter from Senators Elizabeth Warren and Sheldon Whitehouse that said—calling on you to lower interest rates—to cut interest rates because this has “the potential that it may remain too high for too long, has halted advances in deploying renewable energy technologies and delayed significant climate and economic benefits from these projects.” So has higher interest rates caused that?"
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"Estimates based on the consumer price index and other data indicate that total PCE prices rose 2.5 percent over the 12 months ending in February and that, excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 2.8 percent."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"Longer-term inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters as well as from measures from financial markets."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"The median projection in the SEP for total PCE inflation falls to 2.4 percent this year, 2.2 percent next year, and 2 percent in 2026."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,The Fed’s monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"Steve Liesman, CNBC."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,STEVE LIESMAN.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Steve.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Everything we do is in service to our public mission.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"To conclude: We understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Restoring price stability is essential to set the stage for achieving maximum employment and price stability over the long term.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,We remain committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal and to keeping our longer-term inflation expectations well anchored.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"In particular, slowing the pace of runoff will help ensure a smooth transition, reducing the possibility that money markets experience stress and thereby facilitating the ongoing decline in our securities holdings consistent with reaching the appropriate level of ample reserves."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,The decision to slow the pace of runoff does not mean that our balance sheet will ultimately shrink by less than it would otherwise but rather allows us to approach that ultimate level more gradually.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"While we did not make any decisions today on this, the general sense of the Committee is that it will be appropriate to slow the pace of runoff fairly soon, consistent with the plans we previously issued."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"At this meeting, we discussed issues related to slowing the pace of decline in our securities holdings."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"Turning to our balance sheet, our securities holdings have declined by nearly $1.5 trillion since the Committee began reducing our portfolio."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"I also don’t think that those readings added to anyone’s confidence that we’re moving closer to, to that point."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"These projections are not a Committee decision or plan; if the economy does not evolve as projected, the path for policy will adjust as appropriate to foster our maximum-employment and price-stability goals."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"In our SEP, FOMC participants wrote down their individual assessments of an appropriate path for the federal funds rate based on what each participant judges to be the most likely scenario going forward."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,We will continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"Of course, we’re committed to both sides of our dual mandate, and an unexpected weakening in the labor market could also warrant a policy response."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,The Committee does not expect it will be appropriate to reduce the target range until it has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably down toward 2 percent.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"In considering any adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"At the same time, reducing policy restraint too late or too little could unduly weaken economic activity and employment."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,We know that reducing policy restraint too soon or too much could result in a reversal of the progress we have seen on inflation and ultimately require even tighter policy to get inflation back to 2 percent.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"We are prepared to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate for longer, if appropriate."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"The economic outlook is uncertain, however, and we remain highly attentive to inflation risks."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"We believe that our policy rate is likely at its peak for this tightening cycle and that, if the economy evolves broadly as expected, it will likely be appropriate to begin dialing back policy restraint at some point this year."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"As labor market tightness has eased and progress on inflation has continued, the risks to achieving our employment and inflation goals are coming into better balance."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,The Committee decided at today’s meeting to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 5¼ to 5½ percent and to continue the process of significantly reducing our securities holdings.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,We are strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent objective.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"My colleagues and I are acutely aware that high inflation imposes significant hardship as it erodes purchasing power, especially for those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"If the economy evolves as projected, the median participant projects that the appropriate level of the federal funds rate will be 4.6 percent at the end of this year, 3.9 percent at the end of 2025, and 3.1 percent at the end of 2026, still above the medium— median longer-term funds rate."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, you know, we didn’t—the last thing I’ll say is we didn’t excessively celebrate the good inflation readings we got in the last seven months of last year."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"We, at the Fed, will do everything we can to achieve our maximum-employment and price-stability goals."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"What you heard us saying was that we needed to see more that we could, you know—we wanted to be careful about that decision, and we’re not going to overreact, as well, to these two months of data, nor are we going to ignore them."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Can you give us more color on how the Committee is thinking about inflation dynamics now?
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Michael McKee with Bloomberg Radio and Television.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHAEL MCKEE.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Mike.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"We did see progress on inflation last year—significant progress, despite financial conditions sometimes being tighter, sometimes looser."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, we saw—that’s been a question for a while."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"There are also supply-side things happening, but I think those are demand-side things happening."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Things like that are really demand.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"And there I would point to job openings, quits, surveys, the hiring rate."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, ultimately, we do think that financial conditions are weighing on economic activity, and we think you see that in—a great place to see it is in the labor market, where you’ve seen demand cooling off a little bit from the extremely high levels."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we think—there are many different financial conditions indicators, and you can kind of, you know, see different answers to that question."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"How do you assess the state of financial conditions right now, and particularly—in particular, do you view the kind of easing in financial conditions since the fall as consistent and compatible with what you’re trying to achieve on the inflation mandate?"
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Neil Irwin with Axios.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Chair Powell."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,NEIL IRWIN.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Neil.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, in and of itself, strong job growth is not a reason, you know, for us to be concerned about inflation."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"We now have a better sense that a big part of that was supply-side healing, particularly with, with growth in the labor force."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mean, we saw—you saw last year very strong hiring and inflation coming down quickly."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,No.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"No, not all by itself."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,But—so strong hiring in and of itself would not be a reason to hold off on rate cuts?
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,JEANNA SMIALEK.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"So you can have that if you have a continued supply-side activity that we had last year with—both with supply chains and also with, with growth in the size of the labor force."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"In fact, they were decreasing."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"What we’ve seen at the beginning of the year, are they more one-off increases that will fade, or is there more of a secular turn with goods prices rising again and service prices staying sticky?"
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"And also housing prices have been sort of the Godot of this cycle, in that you keep expecting them to go down, and they don’t."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"How does the Committee see this playing out forward, since you’ve raised your inflation forecast?"
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,We didn’t take too much signal out of that.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Edward Lawrence with FOX Business.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,EDWARD LAWRENCE.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Go to Edward.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I think the historical record, it’s—every situation is different, but the historical record is that you need to approach that question carefully and try to get it right the first time and not have to come back and raise rates again perhaps if you cut inappropriately— prematurely."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,It is very important for everyone that we serve that we do get inflation sustainably down.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s why we are approaching this question carefully.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,And we just don’t—we can’t know that.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"Now here are some bumps, and the question is, are they more than bumps?"
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,We consistently said that.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,We were saying that we’ll—it’s going to be a bumpy ride.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’ve got nine months of 2½ percent inflation now, and we’ve had two months of kind of bumpy inflation."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, so, if what we’re getting is a lot of supply and a lot of demand, and that supply is actually feeding demand because workers are getting paid and they’re spending and that’s, you know—what you would have is potentially kind of what you had last year, which is a bigger economy where inflationary pressures are not increasing."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,I think that’s what you still see.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,It certainly hasn’t improved our confidence—it hasn’t raised anyone’s confidence.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Have the recent numbers we’ve gotten for inflation data dented that confidence at all?
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"Well, you’ve talked about the desire to have confidence that inflation is continually moving down."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHAEL MCKEE.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"In the meantime, the economy is strong, the labor market is strong, inflation has come way down, and that gives us the ability to approach this question carefully and feel more confident that inflation is moving down sustainably at 2 percent when we take that step to begin dialing back our restrictive policy."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,We’ll have to find out.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,I don’t think we really know whether this is a bump on the road or something more.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,We’re going to— we’re going to let the data show.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, we tend to see a little bit stronger—this is in the data—a little bit stronger inflation in the first half of the year, a little bit less strong later in the year."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"So the question is, what are we going to see?"
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"So then February wasn’t, wasn’t as high, but it was higher."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, again, you don’t want to—you’ve got to be careful about dismissing the parts of the data that you don’t like."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"As I mentioned, you can look at January, which is a very high reading and you can—and I think many people did see the possibility of seasonal adjustment problems there."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"But I would say that the story is really essentially the same and that is of inflation coming down gradually toward 2 percent on a sometimes-bumpy path, as I mentioned."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Yeah.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,So I see the Committee looking at the two months of data and asking the same question you’re asking and saying we’re just going to have to see what the data show.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"And just in general, if labor supply continued to rebound in 2024, the way it did in 2023, what would stronger hiring and possibly stronger growth mean for the path forward on policy?"
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Is there a real sense here that the economy has perhaps changed in some way that higher rates will be needed in the future?
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"Can you speak about why, [what] might be behind that?"
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"In the projections, there is an increase in the neutral rate, as you know, and higher rates—¼ point higher rates projected in 2025, 2026."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Chris Rugaber, the Associated Press."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,CHRISTOPHER RUGABER.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Chris.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"Again, I don’t—there’s nothing in the data pointing at that, but those are the things that we’ll be looking at, at coming meetings and—without trying to refer to any specific meeting."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"I also mentioned—and we don’t see this in the data right now, but if there were a significant weakening in the data, particularly in the labor market, that could also be a reason for us to begin the process of reducing rates."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,So I just would say that the Committee wants to see more data that gives us higher confidence that inflation is moving down sustainably toward 2 percent.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,So I don’t want to—I wouldn’t want to dismiss anything.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’ll take—you know, things can happen during an intermeeting period, if you look back—unexpected things."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,ANN SAPHIR.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I really don’t have anything for you on any specific meeting, looking forward."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,And we didn’t make any decisions about future meetings today.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,So we make decisions meeting by meeting.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Yeah.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Just give us a sense of your thinking there.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"Or, by June, is there enough data for you?"
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"Is there enough data between now and, say, May to be able to get the kind of confidence that you say you still need?"
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Could you speak a little bit more about the timing?
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, yes, Chair Powell."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,ANN SAPHIR.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Ann.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"Those are going to depend on our ongoing assessment of the incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mean just a question of—I mean, is there even enough data for you to be able to— CHAIR POWELL."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"They’re pretty modest changes, but you’re right."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"Per your comment to Ann that a weakening in the labor market would be a reason to potentially cut rates or at least a consideration in making a rate cut, would continued strength in the labor market be a reason to hold off on rate cuts?"
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you for taking our questions.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,So you’re right.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"Jeanna Smialek, the New York Times."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,JEANNA SMIALEK.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"Nonetheless, we’re looking for data that confirm the kind of low readings that we had last year and give us a higher degree of confidence that what we saw was really inflation moving sustainably down to 2 percent—toward 2 percent."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"The other thing is, in the second half of the year, you have some pretty low readings, so it might be harder to make progress as you move that 12-month window forward."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,It is.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,But that’s really going to depend on the incoming data.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Are you still optimistic that you’ll get the confidence you need this year?
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,CHRIS RUGABER.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I think that—sorry, say your last part of your question again."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,I think that that higher year-end number reflects the data we’ve seen so far this year because you’re now—you’re now in this year.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"I, you know, I think, if you look at the SEP, what it says is that it is still likely in most people’s view that we will achieve that confidence and that there will be rate cuts."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"So are you really, are you still confident or—at the last press conference, you sounded pretty optimistic [that] you would get more confidence at the end of this year."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mean, that doesn’t sound like much disinflation at all."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s already at—or you mentioned it being 2.8 in February.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"On the projections, you also have 2.6 percent core inflation for the end of this year."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"Great, and just a quick follow[-up]."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,CHRIS RUGABER.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,But I think there’s tremendous uncertainty around that.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,I don’t see rates going back down to that level.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"There was an uptick in the longer-run rate, and also there’s a 25 basis point increase in ’25 and ’26."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mean, my instinct would be that rates will not go back down to the very low levels that we saw, where, all around the world, there were long- run [real interest] rates that were at or below zero in some cases."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,But I don’t think we know.
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think it’s, it’s—we think that rates were generally low during the pre-pandemic post–Global Financial Crisis era for reasons that are mostly, you know, important, slow-moving, large things like demographics and productivity and that sort of thing—things that don’t move quickly."
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,Is it right to say that this suggests you’re not seeing a lot of disinflation this year compared to what we’ve seen 2023 and so forth?
2024-03-20,Press Conf - Full Text,"In terms of, are rates going to be higher in the longer run, if that’s really your question, I don’t think we know that."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s not what we’re hired to do.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,VICTORIA GUIDA.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,There’s— VICTORIA GUIDA.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,We’re on the road where we’re serving all the American people and making our decisions based on the data and how those data affect the outlook and the balance of risks.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"And then, is there a significant difference between, you know, whether you start in, say, September versus December?"
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"If we start down that road, again, I don’t know how you stop."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Read all the transcripts, and see if anybody mentions, in any way, the pending election."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,—a significant difference between an institution that takes into account all sorts of political events and one that doesn’t.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"That’s where the significant difference is, and, you know, we’re—we just don’t do that."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mean, you can go back and read the transcripts for every—this is my fourth election, fourth presidential election here."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,It just isn’t part of our thinking.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, and so we’re not on that road."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,An economic difference.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"If you go down that road, where do you stop?"
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, similarly, is there a significant economic difference between, you know, starting to cut in, say, September versus December?"
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"And that’s, that’s how everybody around here thinks."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,You’ve talked about your commitment to being apolitical and nonpartisan.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,So.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Victoria Guida with Politico.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I was just wondering, given that it’s an election year, is the bar for rate changes higher close to an election?"
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we’re, we’re always going to do what we think the right thing for the economy is when we come to that consensus view that it’s the right thing to do for the economy."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s our record.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s what we do.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,We’re not looking at anything else.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, it’s hard enough to get the economics right here."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"These are difficult things, and if, if we were to take on a whole, another, set of factors and use that as a new filter, it would reduce the likelihood we’d actually get the economics right."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,So that’s how we think about it around here.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, we’re at peace over it."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"We know that we’ll do what we think is the right thing, when we think it’s the right thing."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,And we’ll all do that.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I can’t say it enough, that we just don’t—we just don’t go down that road."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,What would you say to them?
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,SIMON RABINOVITCH.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Scott.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Nancy.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,I’m sorry.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hey, Chair Powell."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Nancy Marshall-Genzer from Marketplace.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"You mentioned consumers, and consumers are feeling the weight of interest rates right now."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Mortgage rates are up, as are rates for car loans, credit cards."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,People looking to borrow are very discouraged.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s reflected in their views on the economy.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Well, the thing that hurts everybody, and particularly people in the lower-income brackets, is inflation."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"If you’re a person who’s living paycheck to paycheck, and suddenly all the things you buy—the fundamentals of life—go up in price, you, you are in trouble right away."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Hi.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"And so, with those people in mind, in particular, what we’re doing is, we’re using our tools to bring down inflation."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Simon.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,But we have a ways to go on that.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,So we’ve seen progress.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you, Chair Powell."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Question about the labor market— you’ve mentioned a few times that the labor market is normalizing.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Certainly, today’s JOLTS data suggested that things are kind of getting back to pre-pandemic levels."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"One thing that hasn’t normalized is wage growth, which is still quite a bit stronger than before the pandemic."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"I wonder if you can share your analysis of, of why that’s happening."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Is it a lagging indicator, or is something else going on?"
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I think if you go back to where wages peaked—wage increases peaked a couple, three years ago—essentially all wage measures have come down substantially [when compared] to that."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"But they are not, not down to where they were before the pandemic."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,They’re still roughly a percentage point higher.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,And we’ve seen pretty consistent progress but not uniformly.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"And you’ll note the ECI reading from Tuesday was—it was expected to be—to have come down, and, essentially, it was flat year over year, you know, I think roughly."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"So yeah, I mean, it’s—that part of it is bumpy."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, again, we don’t target wage increases, but, you know, in the longer run, if you have—if you have wage increases running higher than productivity would warrant, then, you know, there will be inflationary pressures."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Employers will raise prices over time if that’s the case.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"It has been inconsistent, but we have seen a substantial decline overall."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,VICTORIA GUIDA.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Michael McKee.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"In terms of potential output, though, that’s a separate question."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’ve had a—what amounts to a, a significant increase in the potential output of the economy that’s not about productivity."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"It was about having more labor, frankly, both through—in 2022, both through participation and also through immigration."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we’re very much—like other forecasters and economists—getting our arms around what that means for potential output this year and next year—and last year for that matter, too."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I think—in that case, I think you really do have a significant increase in potential output, but you’ve also got—so you’ve got more supply."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"But those people also come in, they work, they have jobs, they spend."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,So you’ve also got demand.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"So it—there may be—it may be that you get more supply than you get demand at the beginning, but, ultimately, it should be neither inflationary nor disinflationary over, over a longer period."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHAEL MCKEE.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"You said earlier that, at this point, you’re not really considering rate increases."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"If growth is higher, but you’re not considering rate increases, does that imply that you’re more worried about causing the economy to slow too much than you are about inflation taking off again?"
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,No.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think we, we believe our policy stance is in a good place and is appropriate to the current situation."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"We believe it’s restrictive, and, you know, we—our evidence for that, I went over earlier."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,I don’t think we know that.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,You see it in the labor market.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,One is: Will productivity run persistently above its longer-run trend?
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,So I think it’s hard to draw from the data.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"It will take some time, but we will succeed."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Right now we have—and very slow growth—so right now we have 3 percent growth, which is, you know, pretty solid growth I would say, by any measure, and we have inflation running under 3 percent."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,So I don’t—I don’t really understand where that’s coming from.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, in addition, I would say most forecasters, including our forecasting, was that last year’s level of growth was very high—3.4 percent in, I guess, the fourth quarter, you know— and probably not going to be sustained and would come down."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,But that would be—that would be our forecast.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,That wouldn’t be stagflation.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,That would still be to a very healthy level of growth.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, of course, with inflation, you know, our—we will return inflation to 2 percent, and that won’t be—so I don’t see the “stag” or the “flation,” actually."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,[Laughter] MICHELLE SMITH.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHAEL MCKEE.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Michael McKee from Bloomberg Radio and Television.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,The Vice Chair of the FOMC said recently that he’s willing to consider the idea that potential growth has moved up.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, of course, he’s “Mr."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Potential Growth/r*.” Do you share that view, and would that imply that maybe policy isn’t tight enough?"
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I think I would take that question this way: We saw a year of very high productivity growth in 2023, and we saw a year of, I think, negative productivity growth in 2022."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mean, the question is, will productivity run—there are two questions."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Victoria.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"You see it in inflation-sensitive spending, where demand has clearly come down a lot over the past few years."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,So that’s how I would think about it.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Was there discussion about a rate hike at all?
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"So the policy focus has been on—has really been on what to do about, about holding the current—the current level of restriction."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s really—that’s part of the policy.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s where the policy discussion was in the meeting.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,EDWARD LAWRENCE.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,I wanted to follow [up] on the 3 percent.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Is there a time frame of persistent inflation that would trigger a rate hike?
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,There isn’t any rule.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,You can’t look to a rule.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, these are— these are going to be judgment calls."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, clearly restrictive monetary policy needs more time to do its job."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"That, that is pretty clear, based on what we’re seeing."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"How long that will take and how patient we should be is going to depend on the totality of the data, how the outlook evolves."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,EDWARD LAWRENCE.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"And that’s, that’s more from monetary policy, whereas the supply side of things that are happening are more on the supply side."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,So that’s where we are.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,We don’t see that.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Edward.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,EDWARD LAWRENCE.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Edward Lawrence from Fox Business.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,So GDP growth is about 2 percent.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Inflation—[Un]employment is about 4 percent.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"It feels a lot like a steady state, and we have 3 percent inflation."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"So if the data remains the same that you’re seeing, and I know you said you don’t see a rate hike, but it stands to reason that you would need a rate hike to get from 3 to 2 percent inflation."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"So was there any discussion about a rate hike in today’s meeting, and, you know, are you satisfied with 3 percent inflation for the rest of the year?"
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Well, of course we’re not satisfied with 3 percent inflation."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,“Three percent” can’t be in a sentence with “satisfied.” [Laughter] So we will return inflation to 2 percent over time but over time.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we think our policy stance is, is appropriate to do that."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"So if we were to conclude that policy is not sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation sustainably down to 2 percent, then that would be what it would take for us to want to increase rates."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,We don’t see evidence for that.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we will bring inflation back down to 2 percent, and then people won’t have to worry about it again."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"We have 12 Reserve Banks around the country where they have their own economic staff, not the people who work here at the Board."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,But the dividends will be paid and will be very large.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,But a broader—it would be a broader thing that would—that would suggest that it would be appropriate to consider cutting.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think whether you decide to cut will depend on all the facts and circumstances, not just that one."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Kyle.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,KYLE CAMPBELL.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Chair Powell, thanks for taking the question."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Kyle Campbell with American Banker.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"You’ve said that broad and material changes are needed for the Basel III Endgame proposal, and you’ve mentioned that a re-proposal is something that’s on the table."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"As you’ve had more time to sort of sit with the public commentary, process that, and understand the options available to you, do you have a better sense of whether a re-proposal will be necessary, and do you have a timeline in mind for when, you know, some sort of movement will be made on that front—either a re-proposal or a move to finalize?"
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"So let me—let me start by saying that the Fed is committed to, you know, completing this process and carrying out Basel III Endgame in a way that’s faithful to Basel and also comparable to what the other large comparable jurisdictions are doing."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"We haven’t made any decisions on, on policy or on process at all."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Nothing.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Nothing.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,No decisions have been made.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,A couple of tenths in the unemployment rate would be—would probably not do that.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"I’ll say again, though, if we conclude that re-proposal is appropriate, we won’t hesitate to insist on that."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, you know, it would be—it would have to be meaningful and get our attention and lead us to think that the labor market was really significantly weakening for us to want to react to it."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, I said “an unexpected weakening” is what I—the way I characterized it."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s a tremendous result.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’re very, of course, gratified and pleased that that hasn’t happened."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, if you look at the dynamics that enabled that, it really was that this, the—that so much of the gain was from the unwinding of things that weren’t to do with monetary policy but the unwinding of the distortions to the economy, you know, supply problems—supply-side problems and also some, some demand issues as well."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,The unwinding of those really helped inflation come down.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Now, as I’ve said, I’m not giving up on that."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I think—I think it is possible that, that those forces will still work to help us bring inflation down."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"We can’t—we can’t be guaranteed that that’s true, though."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"And so we’re—you know, we’re trying to use our tools in a way that keeps the labor market strong, and the economy strong, but also helps bring inflation back down to 2 percent sustainably."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,We will bring inflation down to 2 percent sustainably.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"We hope we can do it without, you know, without significant dislocations in the labor market or elsewhere."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,JENNIFER SCHONBERGER.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"And speaking of dislocations in the labor market: In terms of cutting, you said, if there were weakness in the job market, that could be a reason to cut rates."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"So if the unemployment rate were to tick above 4 percent but inflation not back down to your 2 percent target, how would you look at that?"
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Would the unemployment rate popping back above 4 percent catch your attention?
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, you know—and I’m not going to try to define exactly what I mean by that."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,That didn’t happen.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,KYLE CAMPBELL.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,It guarantees you a diversity of perspectives.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,So I think that the perspectives are very diverse.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"But—and, in terms of—in terms of dissents, you know, we have dissents."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, a thoughtful dissent is a good thing, if someone really makes you think, that kind of thing."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,But all I can say from my standpoint is I try—I listen carefully to people.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,I try to incorporate their thinking or do everything I can to incorporate their thinking into what we’re doing.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I think many people, if they feel that’s happening, you know, that for most people most of the time, that’ll be enough."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"And—but I’m not—I mean, it’s, it’s not, you know, frowned upon or illegal or against the rules or anything like that."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,It just is the way things come out.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I mean, I think we have a very diverse group of rounded people—frankly, more diverse than it used to be in many dimensions, more diverse from the obvious gender and demographic ways, but also we have more people who are not Ph.D. economists."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,So we have people from business and law and academia and things like that.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,So I think we actually do have quite a good diverse perspective.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think all of us read these stories about the lack of diversity, and we look around the room and say, “I don’t understand."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"I really don’t understand what they’re talking about.” So—but I get the question, though."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you very much.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, and so each, each Reserve Bank has its own culture around monetary policy and its own approach and that kind of thing."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"And then do you need to resolve issues with the capital proposal in order to advance other parts of the regulatory agenda, or do you expect to continue to make progress on those other agenda items?"
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,There are different people.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,And it’s one of the great aspects of the Federal Reserve System.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, there’s no mechanical rule in place there."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"But I would say that the, you know, the Basel III process is by far the most important thing and really is, I think, occupying us at this time in terms of what’s, what’s—what we’re moving ahead with."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Let’s go to Mark for the last question.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,MARK HAMRICK.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Mark Hamrick with Bankrate.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Mr. Chairman, what can you tell us about the approach that you take with your role in the sense of trying to achieve consensus, which you recently identified as a priority, while allowing for a range of views or even dissent?"
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"We don’t see many dissenting votes in the official statements, even when more spirited discussions are noted in the minutes after the fact."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,How do you avoid groupthink and avoid a higher risk of a policy mistake?
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I think if you listen to, and you all do, listen to my 18 colleagues on the FOMC, you’ll see that we do not lack for a diversity of voices and perspectives."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,We really don’t.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,It was high single-digits inflation.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"That’s what we’re doing, and we know that it’s painful and inconvenient."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think we thought, and most people thought, there would have to be probably significant dislocations somewhere in the economy, perhaps the labor market, to get inflation all the way down from the very high levels it was at at the beginning of this episode."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Courtenay.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,COURTENAY BROWN.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Courtenay Brown from Axios.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thanks for taking our questions, Chair Powell."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,I wanted to follow up on something you mentioned earlier on housing inflation.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,There’s kind of been this long-awaited disinflation in shelter that still hasn’t arrived.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I guess two questions, how do you explain the substantial lags between some of the private- sector data we’re seeing and the government data, and how confident are you that rents will be helpful on the inflation front in the coming months?"
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, essentially, there are—there are a number of places in the economy where there are just lag structures built into the inflation process, and housing is one of them."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"So when you have—when, when someone goes to—a new person goes to rent an apartment, that’s called market rent, and you can see market rents are barely going up at all."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,The inflation in those has been very low.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"But it takes—before that, they were incredibly high."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"They sort of led the, the high part."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"So what happens is, those market rents take years, actually, to get all the way into rents for tenants who are rolling over their leases."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’ve got work left to do, but we’re not looking at the very high inflation rates that we were seeing two years ago."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Landlords don’t tend to charge as much of an increase to a rollover tenant, for whatever reason."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,And we have a ways to go.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Those two things are working to bring down inflation, and we’ve made a lot of progress."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, and everyone will share in those dividends, and we’ve made quite a lot of progress if you can think about it."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,I think core—I think headline—core PCE [inflation] peaked at 5.8 [percent].
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Now it’s at—anyway, headline peaked at 7.1."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Now it’s at 2.7.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Don’t want to get that wrong.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"No, you don’t."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Quick follow-up—are current interest rates really doing that much, though, to fight inflation right now for those consumers?"
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Yes.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mean, I think—I think that restrictive monetary policy is doing what it’s supposed to do, and it’s—but it’s also, in this case unusually, working alongside and with the healing of the supply side."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"This, this—what was different this time was that a big part of the source of the inflation and the reason why we’re having this conversation is that we had this supply-side kind of collapse, with shortages and bottlenecks and all that kind of thing."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"And so—and this was to do with the shutting down and reopening of the economy and other things that, that really raised demand."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, many factors did that."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I think now you see those two things working together, the reversal of those supply and demand distortions from the pandemic and the response to it, along with restrictive monetary policy."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Let’s remember how far we’ve come.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,So you’re right.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,And what that does is it builds up a sort of an unrealized portion of increases when there have been big increases.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Now I am confident that, as long as market rents remain low, this is going to show up in measured inflation, assuming that market rents do remain low."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we actually have the luxury of having strong growth and a strong labor market, very low unemployment, high job creation, and all of that, and we can be patient."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we will—we’ll be careful and cautious as we approach the decision to cut rates, whereas I think other jurisdictions may go before that."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"In terms of the implications, you know, I think obviously markets see it coming."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s priced in now.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,And so I think the markets and economies can adapt to it.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I think, you know, we haven’t seen—in addition, for the emerging market economies, we haven’t seen the kind of turmoil that was more frequent 20 years ago, 30 years ago."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"And that’s, I think, partly because emerging market countries, many of them have much better monetary policy frameworks, much more credibility on inflation."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,And so they’re navigating this pretty well this time.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Jennifer.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,JENNIFER SCHONBERGER.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you, Chair Powell."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Jennifer Schonberger with Yahoo Finance.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,You sort of backed away from the notion that the economy would need to encounter pain for inflation to come back down.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, given the sticky inflation data in the first quarter, can disinflation still happen along a relatively painless path for the economy, or is some softening in the labor market and the economy likely needed to bring inflation back down?"
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"They have—their inflation is performing about like ours or maybe a little better, but they’re not experiencing the kind of growth we’re experiencing."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"And what happens is, you know—it’s complicated, but the story is it just takes some time for that to get in."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,So I think the difference between the United States and other countries that are now considering rate cuts is that they’re just not having the kind of growth we’re having.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,So that—you’re right.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,How—what will be the exact timing of it?
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,I think we’ve learned that the lags are longer.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"We now think significantly longer than we thought at the beginning, and so confident that it will come but not so confident in the timing of it."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, yes, I expect that, that this will happen."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,COURTENAY BROWN.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks.

2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,NICHOLAS JASINSKI.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you, Chair Powell, for taking the questions."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,This is Nicholas Jasinski from Barron’s Magazine.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"It seems that over the past three or four years, economies and central banks in developed markets, at least, have been on more or less the same trajectory: easing during the pandemic, fighting inflation with restrictive policy on the way out."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,It feels like that may be ending in 2024 based on some of the economic data from Europe and the U.S. and Japan and statements from those central banks as well.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"So my question is, what, what considerations or risks does a period of more divergent global economic trajectories and central bank policies present for the FOMC?"
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think that, that may happen, and, you know that we all serve domestic mandates, right?"
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"I guess I would say I was around for stagflation, and it was, you know, 10 percent—10 percent unemployment."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,I think we’re going to have to let the data lead us on that.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,JEANNA SMIALEK.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thanks for taking our questions, Chair Powell."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"I wonder—you know, obviously Michelle Bowman has been saying that there is a risk that rates may need to increase further, although it’s not her baseline outlook."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"I wonder if you see that as a risk as well, and, if so, what change in conditions would merit considering raising rates at this point?"
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,So I think it’s unlikely that the next policy rate move will be a hike.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,I’d say it’s unlikely.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, our policy focus is really what I just mentioned, which is— which is how long to keep policy restrictive."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"You ask, what would it take?"
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, I think we’d need to see persuasive evidence that our policy stance is not sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation sustainably down to 2 percent over time."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"That’s not—that’s not what we think we’re seeing, as I—as I mentioned, but that’s—something like that is what it would take."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,We’d look at the totality of the data in answer to that question.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"That would include inflation, inflation expectations, and all the other data too."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,JEANNA SMIALEK.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Would that be—would that be a reacceleration in inflation?
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Jeanna.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"But I would say that, you know, we’re committed to retaining our current restrictive stance of policy for as long as is appropriate."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I would say that we believe it is restrictive, and we believe [that] over time it will be sufficiently restrictive."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"That will be a question that, that the data will have to answer."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,HOWARD SCHNEIDER.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"So as a follow-up, if inflation continues running roughly sideways as it has been, the job market stays reasonably strong, unemployment low, and expectations are anchored and maintained, would you disrupt that for— CHAIR POWELL."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Expectations are not anchored?
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,HOWARD SCHNEIDER.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Are anchored.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Are anchored.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,HOWARD SCHNEIDER.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Stable, roughly."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Would you disrupt that for the last half point on PCE?
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, I don’t want to get into complicated hypotheticals."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,And we’ll do that.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Sufficiently restrictive, I guess."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Well, I think, again, the test—what I’m saying is, if we were to come to that conclusion that policy weren’t tight enough to achieve that, so it would be the totality of all the things we’d be looking at."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,It could be a combination of things.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"In terms of peak rate, you know, I think, really, it’s the same question."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"I, I think the data will have to answer that question for us."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,CHRISTOPHER RUGABER.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"And could you just follow—on the path where you might not cut, is that—you mentioned that would be inflation persistent—I mean, is inflation—would that be the key data in making that decision, or could you expand a bit more on that?"
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Again, it’s, it’s—we’ve set ourselves a test that we—for us to begin to reduce policy restriction, we’d want to be confident that inflation is moving—you know, moving sustainably down to 2 percent, and, for sure, one of the things we’d be looking at is the performance of inflation."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,We’d also be looking at inflation expectations.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,We’d be looking at the whole story.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"But clearly, incoming, incoming inflation data would be at the very heart of that decision."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,CHRISTOPHER RUGABER.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Nick.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,NICK TIMIRAOS.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,So I think it really will depend on the data.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,It could be expectations.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,So those are paths in which you could see us cutting rates.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think there’s also other paths that the economy could take, which, which would cause us to want to consider rate cuts."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, if we—if we reach that conclusion—and we don’t see evidence supporting that conclusion—that’s what it would take I think for us to take that step."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Chris.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,CHRISTOPHER RUGABER.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you, Chris Rugaber at Associated Press."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,You didn’t mention the idea that rates are at a peak for the cycle and didn’t mention the idea that it might be appropriate to cut rates later this year as you have in previous press conferences.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,So has the Fed sort of dropped its easing bias?
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Where are you standing on that?
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, on—let me address cuts."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, obviously, our decisions that we make on our policy rate are going to depend on the incoming data, how the outlook is evolving, and the balance of risks, as always."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,And we’ll look at the totality of the data.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I think, and we think, that policy is well positioned to address different paths that the economy might take."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,And we’ve said that we don’t think it would be appropriate to dial back our restrictive policy stance until we’ve gained greater confidence that inflation is moving down sustainably toward 2 percent.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, for example, let me take a path: If we did have a path where inflation proves more persistent than expected and where the labor market remains strong, but inflation is moving sideways and we’re not gaining greater confidence, well, that would be a case in which it could be appropriate to hold off on rate cuts."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"And those would be—two of those paths would be that we do gain greater confidence, as we’ve said, that inflation is moving sustainably down to 2 percent, and another path could be, you know, an unexpected weakening in the labor market, for example."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,HOWARD SCHNEIDER.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"You also see in interest-sensitive spending, like housing and investment—you also see that higher interest rates are weighing on those activities."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Strong job creation over the past year has been accompanied by an increase in the supply of workers, reflecting increases in participation among individuals aged 25 to 54 years and a continued strong pace of immigration."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Nominal wage growth has eased over the past year and the jobs-to-workers gap has narrowed, but labor demand still exceeds the supply of available workers."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Inflation has eased notably over the past year but remains above our longer-run goal of 2 percent.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Total PCE prices rose 2.7 percent over the 12 months ending in March; excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 2.8 percent."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,The inflation data received so far this year have been higher than expected.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Although some measures of short-term inflation expectations have increased in recent months, longer-term inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters, as well as measures from financial markets."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,The Fed’s monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"My colleagues and I are acutely aware that high inflation imposes significant hardship, as it erodes purchasing power, especially for those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,We are strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent objective.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"The Committee decided at today’s meeting to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 5¼ to 5½ percent and to continue the process of significantly reducing our securities holdings, though at a slower pace."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Over the past year, as labor market tightness has eased and inflation has declined, the risks to achieving our employment and inflation goals have moved toward better balance."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"The economic outlook is uncertain, however, and we remain highly attentive to inflation risks."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,We’ve stated that we do not expect that it will be appropriate to reduce the target range for the federal funds rate until we have gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2 percent.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"So far this year, the data have not given us that greater confidence."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"In particular, and as I noted earlier, readings on inflation have come in above expectations."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Payroll job gains averaged 276,000 jobs per month in the first quarter, while the unemployment rate remains low at 3.8 percent."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,It is likely that gaining such greater confidence will take longer than previously expected.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"The labor market remains relatively tight, but supply and demand conditions have come into better balance."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Consumer spending has been robust over the past several quarters, even as high interest rates have weighed on housing and equipment investment."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Transcript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference May 1, 2024 CHAIR POWELL."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,In terms of your question—your second question was stagflation.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,My colleagues and I remain squarely focused on our dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,The economy has made considerable progress toward our dual-mandate objectives.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Inflation has eased substantially over the past year, while the labor market has remained strong."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,And that’s very good news.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"But inflation is still too high, further progress in bringing it down is not assured, and the path forward is uncertain."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,We are fully committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent goal.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Restoring price stability is essential to achieve a sustainably strong labor market that benefits all.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Today, the FOMC decided to leave our policy interest rate unchanged and to continue to reduce our securities holdings, though at a slower pace."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Our restrictive stance of monetary policy has been putting downward pressure on economic activity and inflation, and the risks to achieving our employment and inflation goals have moved toward better balance over the past year."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"However, in recent months, inflation has shown a lack of further progress toward our 2 percent objective, and we remain highly attentive to inflation risks."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,I’ll have more to say about monetary policy after briefly reviewing economic developments.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a solid pace.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Although GDP growth moderated from 3.4 percent in the fourth quarter of last year to 1.6 percent in the first quarter, private domestic final purchases—which excludes inventory investment, government spending and net exports, and usually sends a clearer signal on underlying demand—was 3.1 percent in the first quarter, as strong as the second half of 2023."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Improving supply conditions have supported resilient demand and the strong performance of the U.S. economy over the past year.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I do think it’s clear that, that policy is restrictive."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,We are prepared to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate for as long as appropriate.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,We know that reducing policy restraint too soon or too much could result in a reversal of the progress we’ve seen on inflation.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,HOWARD SCHNEIDER.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Howard Schneider with Reuters.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"A question and follow-up if I could, do you consider the current policy rate still—are you confident that it’s sufficiently restrictive to get inflation back to 2 percent?"
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I do think the evidence shows, you know, pretty clearly that policy is restrictive and is weighing on demand, and there are a few places I would point to for that."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,You can start with the labor market.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"So demand is still strong—the demand side of the labor market, in particular—but it’s cooled from its extremely high level of a couple years ago, and you see that in job openings."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"You saw it—more evidence of that today in the JOLTS report, as you’ll know."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s still higher than pre-pandemic.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,But it has been coming down both in the Indeed report and the JOLTS report.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"That’s, that’s demand cooling."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"The same is true of quits and hiring rates, which have essentially normalized."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"I also look at the—we look at surveys of workers and—pardon me—surveys of workers and businesses, and [they] ask workers, “Are jobs plentiful?” and ask businesses, “Are workers plentiful?"
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Is it easy to find workers?” And you’ve seen that the answers to those have come back down to pre-pandemic levels.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Howard.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,We’re also prepared to respond to an unexpected weakening in the labor market.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"At the same time, reducing policy restraint too late or too little could unduly weaken economic activity and employment."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"In considering any adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Policy is well positioned to deal with the risks and uncertainties that we face in pursuing both sides of our dual mandate.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,We will continue to make decisions meeting by meeting.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Turning to our balance sheet: The Committee decided at today’s meeting to slow the pace of decline in our securities holdings, consistent with the plans we released previously."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Specifically, the cap on Treasury redemptions will be lowered from the current $60 billion per month to $25 billion per month as of June 1."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Consistent with the Committee’s intention to hold primarily Treasury securities in the longer run, we’re leaving the cap on agency securities unchanged per month, and we will reinvest any proceeds in excess of this cap in Treasury securities."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"With principal payments on agency securities currently running at about $15 billion per month, total portfolio runoff will amount to roughly $40 billion per month."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,The decision to slow the pace of runoff does not mean that our balance sheet will ultimately shrink by less than it would otherwise but rather allows us to approach its ultimate level more gradually.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"In particular, slowing the pace of runoff will help ensure a smooth transition, reducing the possibility that money markets experience stress and thereby facilitating the ongoing decline in our securities holdings that are consistent with reaching the appropriate level of ample reserves."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,We remain committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal and to keeping longer-term inflation expectations well anchored.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Restoring price stability is essential to set the stage for achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the longer run.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"To conclude: We understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Everything we do is in service to our public mission.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"We, at the Fed, will do everything we can to achieve our maximum-employment and price-stability goals."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,I look forward to your questions.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Chair Powell, to what extent has the easing in financial conditions since November contributed to the reacceleration in growth, and do you now expect a period of sustained tighter financial conditions will be needed to resume the sort of disinflation the economy saw last year?"
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Good afternoon.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,So I think it’s hard to know that.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"And this is—this is a long—a plan we’ve long had in place to slow, really not in order to, you know, provide accommodation to the economy but to—or to be less restrictive to the economy."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,It really is to ensure that the process of shrinking the balance sheet down to where we want to get it is a smooth one and doesn’t wind up in—with financial market turmoil the way it did the last—the last time we did this and the only other time we’ve ever done this.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Craig.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,CRAIG TORRES.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Craig Torres from Bloomberg.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mean, the active tool of monetary policy is, of course, the interest rates."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Two questions.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Given the run of data since March, has the probability in your mind of no cuts this year increased or stayed the same?"
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s the first question.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Second question.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Chair Powell, you joined the Board in 2012, and I’m sure you remember, as I do, what the jobless recovery was like: lawyers, accountants, all kinds of highly qualified people who couldn’t get jobs."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"And given your history there, I wonder if there’s an argument for being more patient with inflation here."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,We have strong productivity growth that’s helping wages grow up—go up.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"First, a simple one."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,No.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,I wouldn’t say that.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"I will say, nothing is going to come out of that that’s going to change the view."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think that, in fact, we didn’t gain confidence and that it’s going to take longer to get that confidence—but—confidence."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,I just think—you know the story.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"What’s happened since December is you’ve seen higher goods inflation than expected, and you’ve seen higher nonhousing services inflation than expected."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"And those two are working together to, to sort of be higher than we had thought."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"And there are stories behind how that happened, and, you know, we—I think—I think my expectation is that we will, over the course of this year, see inflation move back down."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"That’s, that’s my forecast."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,I think my confidence in that is lower than it was because of the data that we’ve seen.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, you know, we’re looking at those things."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"We also continue to expect, and I continue to expect, that housing services inflation, given where market rents are, those will show up in measured housing services inflation over time."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,We believe that it will.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"It just—it looks like the lag—that there are substantial lags between when, you know, lower market rates turned up and—for new tenants and when it shows up for existing tenants or for in-housing services."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,STEVE LIESMAN.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"If I could just follow up: Is there a bit of a contradiction in the idea that you are reducing quantitative tightening, which is sort of an easing, while you’re holding rates steady at a restrictive rate to try to slow and cool the economy and inflation?"
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,We have good employment.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,And so it seems to me there’s a lot of hysteria about inflation.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"I agree—you know, nobody likes it, but is there an argument for being patient and working with the economic cycle to get it down over time?"
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,CLAIRE JONES.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Claire Jones, Financial Times."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks a lot for the opportunity to ask the questions.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Just to go back to the answer before the previous one, it seemed to suggest that you think the likeliest path of inflation is one that’s going to allow you to have a situation where rates are lower at the end of the year than they are right now."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,It’d be good if you could just confirm whether or not that’s a correct reading.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,And the Q1 GDP print has led to some—some to start mentioning the term “stagflation” with respect to the U.S. economy.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Do you or anyone else on the FOMC think this is now a risk?
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Yeah.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,I’m not dealing really in likelihoods.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,I think there are—there are paths that the economy can take that would involve cuts and there are paths that wouldn’t.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,And I don’t have great confidence in which of those paths—I think I would say my personal forecast is that we will begin to see further progress on inflation this year.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"I don’t know that it will be enough, sufficient."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Claire.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we will—you know, we will put the thing—we have put the thing under a microscope."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,And so we are focusing on it.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, on your first question, I don’t have a probability estimate for you."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"But all I can say is that, you know, we’ve said that we didn’t think it would be appropriate to cut until we were more confident that inflation was moving sustainably down to 2 percent."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"We didn’t get our confidence, in that [it] didn’t increase in the first quarter."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, in fact, what really happened was we came to the view that it will take longer to get that confidence."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I think there are—you know, I think it’s—the economy has been very hard for forecasters broadly to predict—to predict its path."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"But there are paths to, to not cutting, and there are paths to cutting."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s really going to depend on the data.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"In terms of the employment mandate, to your point, if you go back a couple of years, our, our sort of framework document says that, when you look at the two mandate goals, and if one of them is further away from goal than the other, then you focus on that one."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"It actually—it’s the time to get back there times the, you know, times how far it is from the goal."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,And that was clearly inflation.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,So our focus was very much on inflation.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,As—and this is what we referred to in the statement.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"As inflation has come down, now to below 3 percent on a—on a 12-month basis, it’s become—we’re now focusing [on] the other goal."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,The employment goal now comes back into focus.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, and that’s how we think about that."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Yeah.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,I don’t know that it won’t.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,What’s the dynamic by which you expect them to work out in the coming months and quarters?
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,So I just want to be careful that we don’t target wage growth or the labor market.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"And remember what we saw last year: very strong growth, a really tight labor market, and a historically fast decline in inflation."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,So—and that’s because we know there are two forces at work here.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"There’s the unwinding of the pandemic-related supply-side distortions and demand-side distortions, and there’s also monetary policy, you know, restrictive monetary policy."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,So I wouldn’t rule out that something like that can continue.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, I wouldn’t give up, at this point, on further things happening on the supply side either because, you know, we do see that companies still report that there are supply-side issues that they’re facing."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"And also, even when the supply-side issues are solved, it should take some time for that to affect economic activity and ultimately inflation."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,So there are still those things.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I don’t like to say that either strong—either growth or, or a strong labor market, in and of itself, would automatically create problems on inflation, because, of course, it didn’t do that last year."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,You ask about wages.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,We also don’t—we don’t target wages.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,We target price inflation.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,It is one of the inputs.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"The point with wages is, of course, we, like everyone else, like to see high wages, but we also want to see them not eaten up by high inflation."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"And that’s really what we’re trying to do, is to cool the economy and work with what’s happening on the supply side to bring—to bring the economy back to 2 percent inflation."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Part of that will probably be having wage increases move down incrementally toward levels that are more sustainable.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"I wonder, would continued strength in the labor market change your view about the appropriate stance of policy if it was accompanied by signs the wage growth was reaccelerating?"
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,NICK TIMIRAOS.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think we’ll be able to look back, you know, from down the road and look back and understand it better."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Really, what we’ve seen so far this year in the first quarter is growth coming in about consistent with where it was last year."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"I know GDP came in lower, but you don’t see an acceleration in growth."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mean, the thought would be that financial conditions loosened in, in, December, and that caused an uptick in activity, and that caused inflation."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Presumably, that’s what we’re tightening in the labor market."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,You don’t really see that happening.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"What you see is economic activity at a level that’s roughly the same as, as last year."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, you know, what’s causing this inflation?"
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, we’ll, we’ll have a better sense of that over time."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"I don’t know that there’s an obvious connection there, though, with easing of financial conditions."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"In terms of tightening, you’re, you’re right."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Rates are certainly higher now and have been for some time than they were before the December meeting.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"And they’re higher, and that’s tighter financial conditions."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, that’s appropriate, given what inflation has done in the first quarter."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,You’ve said in the past that stronger growth wouldn’t necessarily preclude rate cuts.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, if you look at—let’s look at growth."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,RACHEL SIEGEL.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,And so take a step back.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,What do we now see in the first quarter?
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"We see strong economic activity, we see a strong labor market, and we see inflation."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"We see three inflation readings, and so I think you’re at a point there where you should take some signal."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"We don’t like to react to one or two months’ data, but this is a full quarter."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I think it’s appropriate to take signal now, and we are taking signal."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,And the signal that we’re taking is that it’s likely to take longer for us to gain confidence that we are on a sustainable path down to 2 percent inflation.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s the signal that we’re taking now.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Yeah.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Steve.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,STEVE LIESMAN.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Mr.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,If I could follow up on that: What particular areas were sort of temporary or blips in the inflation data in the first quarter?
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Rachel.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, what, what—so I thought it was appropriate to reserve judgment until, until we had the full quarter’s data, until we saw the March data."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"I—you know, not really."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Chair, if I could—Steve Liesman, CNBC."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, with hindsight, are there any signs that you can look back on now, looking at the reports from January or February or March, that suggested something more worrying than just expected bumpiness?"
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Chair Powell."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks for taking our questions.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,You talked about needing time to gain more confidence that inflation is sustainably moving back down to 2 percent.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s May now.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"Do you have time this year to cut three times, just given the calendar?"
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Yeah.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,Rachel Siegel from the Washington Post.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, the—what we said is that we need to be more confident, and we’ve said—my colleagues and I today said that we didn’t see progress in the first—in the first quarter."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I’ve said that it appears, then, that it’s going to take longer for us to reach that point of confidence."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,So I don’t know how long it’ll take.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, I can just say that when we get that confidence, then rate cuts will be in scope."
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,And I don’t know exactly when that will be.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,RACHEL SIEGEL.
2024-05-01,Press Conf - Full Text,I’m not really thinking of it that way.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"Claire Jones, Financial Times."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,I’m just drawing on the change in the statement on there being “modest further progress” on inflation.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, halfway, you know, through the year and after today’s CPI release, you know, what have you and other Committee members found that has been particularly encouraging to you?"
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"And just in terms of the conservatism, how much of that is about stickiness and shelter inflation in particular?"
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"If you go back a year, there was a real concern about, you know, very much slowing growth and, and a recession—many forecasters had that."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s been very encouraging.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,And that’s not what happened.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"Instead, we—the U.S. is, anyway, and it’s in—it’s in sharp distinction with many other advanced economies around the world."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,So that’s been encouraging.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"I would say that the, the—today’s inflation report is encouraging, but it comes after, you know, several reports that were not so encouraging."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,You asked about—your second question was really about shelter inflation.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, encouraging has been that growth—you know, the growth, clearly, that we had last year, particularly the second half of last year, and we continue to see still-strong growth—solid growth this year."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,CLAIRE JONES.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"And when we are, then we can look at loosening policy."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"And in the meantime, you know, it’s going to be painful for, for people, but the ultimate pain would be a, a period of long, high—a long period of high inflation."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"It is people who—lower-income people—people who are at the margins of the economy who, who have the worst experience—who experience the most pain from inflation."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, you know, it’s for those people—for all Americans, but particularly for those people—that we’re doing everything we can to bring inflation back down under control."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,JO LING KENT.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,As just a quick follow-up here—you’ve indicated one interest rate cut sometime this year.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I know you don’t have a crystal ball up there, but a lot of people are watching and see, you know, borrowing money remains very expensive."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"For everybody who’s out there waiting on a rate cut, about when can consumers expect some relief?"
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"Well, you know, I, I don’t have a precise date for you."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"But what we said is that we, we want to make sure that we’re confident that inflation is actually moving back down to 2 percent."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"So having that kind of confidence that inflation will be at 2 percent just—it just pays benefits to the whole economy, to all Americans, for a long period of time."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,We had that period for a very long time.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"We very much want to get back to a place where people can, can not think about inflation—it’s just not a concern in the everyday economic decisions that they make."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"We were there for a long time, and our goal is to get back to that place."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we’ve made good progress, and we’re just—we’re in the phase now of just, you know, sticking with it until we get it done."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,Claire.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I think if you go back a couple of years—we, we know that there were renters, and then there are, you know, people who own their houses."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"We, we do it the way we do it, and we’ve been very transparent about it."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"And so when market-based rents go up sharply, as they did at the beginning of the—of the—when the economy reopened, they really went up sharply."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,EDWARD LAWRENCE.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"Edward Lawrence, with Fox Business."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you for taking the question, Chair Powell."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,So I want to go back to jobs and the consumer.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"The last jobs report showed that over the past year, 634,000 more people took multiple jobs."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s up 8.2 percent.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"And since January of 2021, we’ve seen prices rise 19 percent."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,So people are using their credit cards to pay for their lifestyle.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,What pressure points will signal to you that the slowing economy could maybe break companies in terms of hiring or break the consumer in terms of spending?
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, you know, we monitor all the things you mentioned and more."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, what we’re seeing is, basically, spending was going up faster than disposable income during big parts of next year, so—last year, rather—and so what that—you’d expect to see is people spending more on their credit cards."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,That—that has been happening.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,Credit card balances have been going up.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,Credit card defaults have been going up.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,Edward.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we have OER, which is owners’ equivalent rent."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, it’s true that we’re—we’re seeing delays in, in realizing what—what’s happening economically."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,Those play into rollover rents much more slowly for existing tenants than they do for new tenants.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, and so what we—so we, we’ve found now that there are big lags."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"So there’s sort of a—there’s a bulge of high past increases in, in market rents."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"It has to get worked off, and that may take, you know, several years."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"Nonetheless, as long as market rents remain—are going at—up at relatively low levels—and they still are—you know, this, this is just going to happen."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,It just is going to happen more slowly than we thought.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, we, we also do sort of this thing where we impute a rental value to, to owned homes."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"And that’s—you know, many countries around the world do that."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,Some do it differently than us.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s something that the—you know, that the, the price experts have regularly looked at."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"It is not something that we’re the only country that does, and it’s not something we’re looking at changing or would look at changing, you know, anytime soon."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,But it—it’s true.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s one of the very hardest things in, in inflation and in prices is how to think about, you know, the services that someone is getting by living in a home that they could rent, but they’re actually living in it."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,And some countries—you should just ignore that.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,But that’s not our—that’s not how we do inflation here.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"But we understand that—you know, we understand that very well."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,We’re confident that we’ll get there.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, you want to—you want to get it right."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,We had a period of high inflation.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"Wages are still running, you know, I would say, above a, a sustainable path, which would be that of trend inflation and trend productivity."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,You’re still seeing wage increases moving above that.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"We, we haven’t thought of wages as being the principal, you know, cause of inflation."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"But at the same time, getting back to 2 percent inflation is likely to require a return to a more sustainable level, which is somewhat below the current level of increases in the aggregate."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,Rachel.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,RACHEL SIEGEL.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Chair Powell."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,Rachel Siegel from the Washington Post.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks for taking our questions.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,There’s obviously a lot of focus on how many cuts could be expected this year.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,But can you give us a sense of what one cut by the end of the year would actually do to the economy—what you think would be a meaningful difference if there was a cut by the end of the year or even two?
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think if, you know—if you look back in 5 or 10 years and, and try to pull out the significance to the U.S. economy of one 25 basis point rate cut, you’d, you’d have quite a job on your hands."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"So that’s not how we look at it—you know, really, the whole rate path matters."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"As I mentioned, the labor market has come into better balance."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I, I do continue to think that when—you know, when we do start to loosen policy, that will show up in a significant loosening in financial market conditions."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,Inflationary pressures have come down.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"That’s, that’s, you know, catch-up inflation from earlier pressures."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,Chris Rugaber at Associated Press.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,They’re not at high levels.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"I was wondering if we can read—on inflation, if you can tell us a little more about where you see inflationary pressure in the economy."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"You mentioned labor markets coming into better balance, and inflation expectations appear to be well anchored."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"You’re seeing, you know, anecdotal stories of, the large chains like Walmart and Target are announcing price cuts—McDonald’s announcing a $5 meal deal."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"So people may still be unhappy about prices at the grocery store, but it doesn’t seem like there’s a lot of inflationary pressure left in this economy—and wonder if you could tell us more about that."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I, I think it’s true that housing—that inflationary pressures have come down."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,But we still have—we’re still getting high inflation readings.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, you know—and I think you can see it in, in various places in—you know, in some parts of, of nonhousing services."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,You see elevated inflation still—and that’s probably to do with—it could be to do with wages.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,Goods prices have kind of fluctuated.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"There’s been a surprising increase in, in import prices on goods, which is kind of hard to understand."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, may, may—we’ve taken some signal from that, but, you know—and, and, of course, housing services."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,You’re seeing—you’re continuing to see high readings there to some extent.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, I mean, overall, you’re right."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"We—inflation has come down really significantly, and we’re doing everything we can to—you know, to bring that inflationary episode fully to a halt and fully restore price stability."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,And the market will price in what it prices in.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,But it’s a consequential decision for the economy.

2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,JO LING KENT.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Chair Powell."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you for taking our questions.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"I’m Jo Ling Kent, with CBS News."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,What’s your message to Americans who are seeing encouraging economic data but don’t feel good about this economy?
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"I, you know—I, I don’t think anyone knows—has a definitive answer why people are, are not as happy about the economy as they might be."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,And we don’t tell people how they should think or feel about the economy.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s not our job.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"We—you know, people experience what they experience."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"All I can tell you is what the—what the data show, which is, we’ve got an economy that’s growing at a solid pace."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,We’ve got a very strong labor market with unemployment at 4 percent.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s been a long time since we’ve had, you know, a long stretch of time with unemployment at or below 4 percent—very long time."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,You don’t want to—you don’t want to be too motivated by any single data point.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"I don’t—I have no way of saying—we’re, we’re not at that stage, so I don’t know what we’ll be thinking about at that time."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, you know, one reading is—isn’t—it just—it’s only one reading."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’re looking for something that gives us confidence that inflation is, is moving sustainably down to 2 percent."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, fortunately, we have a strong economy, and we, we have the ability to, you know, approach this question carefully."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we will approach it carefully while we’re very much keeping an eye on, you know, downside economic risks, should they—should they emerge."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,RACHEL SIEGEL.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,And you’ve been talking about this clear sense that it’s just going to take longer to have the confidence that’s needed for rate cuts.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,Is there something about what happened in the first couple of months of the year that you’re seeing differently now with more time or hindsight?
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,Do you still characterize it as expected bumpiness or something more lasting that is affecting your policy for the rest of the year?
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, we always want to avoid the tendency to dismiss the parts of inflation that we—that we don’t like and just make it go away."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"So—but we had a quarter where inflation was running higher, and, yes, I could stand here and say, “It’s stuff we shouldn’t have taken signal from.” But it is what it is."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, you, you have to—you know, low inflation is low inflation."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"High—so if you have a quarter where it’s higher—we tried not to take signal from the first couple of months, but we got a third month, and we said, “Okay, the signal we’re taking is that, you know, we think it’s going to take longer to get confidence that inflation is moving sustainably down to 2 percent.” That’s, that’s what we said."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,I think that was the right thing to do.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,I still think that’s the right thing to do.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"Now we have today’s inflation reading, which is very different—very much more positive."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’re going to have to see what the trend is—what’s, what’s going to be the data going forward."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"And readings like today’s, you know—that’s a step in the right direction."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"Remember that after the pandemic, people were cooped up."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s not.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,They couldn’t go out to spend money; they could spend money from home.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, we, we have a strong economy."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,We’ve got growth—all forecasts are very commonly around 2 percent.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s a—that’s a strong growth rate for our economy.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,The labor market continues to print jobs at a pretty high rate.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,Unemployment is still low.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we have the ability now to approach this question carefully, and that’s, that’s what we’re doing."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s our—that’s our dual mandate there.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,JENNIFER SCHONBERGER.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"Otherwise, is it too late, given that the labor market is a lagging indicator—right?—when you look at the monthly jobs data?"
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"Yeah, we, we completely understand that that’s the risk."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"And that’s, that’s not what we’re—that’s not our plan is to wait for things to break and then try to fix them."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’re, we’re trying to balance these two goals in a way that is consistent with our framework, and we think we’re doing that."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"And just to follow, Chair Powell—do you need to be ahead of a weakening in the labor market?"
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I think that’s, that’s the right way for us to think about it."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"Or there’s another test, which is, you know, an unexpected deterioration in labor market conditions."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s—that’s kind of been our test.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,JENNIFER SCHONBERGER.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you, Chair Powell."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"Jennifer Schonberger, with Yahoo Finance."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,You said you would cut rates before inflation falls to 2 percent.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,You’re forecasting inflation to end the year at 2.8 percent on core PCE.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’re at 2.8 percent, of course, on core PCE."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"Right now, you said the inflation forecast is conservative and that if you got to 2.6 to 2.7 [percent] on PCE [inflation], that would be a good place to be."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,You also indicated the job market has mostly normalized.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,So why not cut rates this summer just once—you’re well above neutral—to try to preserve the soft landing rather than risking waiting too long in the quest for confidence for inflation?
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know—so we are—we’re well aware of the two-sided risks here, let me just say."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"We, we understand that if we wait too long, that could come at the cost of economic activity, of employment, of the expansion."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"We understand that if we move too, too quickly, we could end up undoing a lot of the good that we’ve done and have to then start over, and it could be very disruptive."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we’re, we’re extremely aware of both of those risks and, and just basically trying to manage them."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"And what we said is that we’ll—that we’re—we don’t think it’ll be appropriate to, to begin to loosen policy until we’re more confident that inflation is moving down to 2 percent over time on a sustainable basis."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,Evan.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,EVAN RYSER.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you, Chair Powell."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,Evan Ryser with Market News International.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"I wouldn’t—there isn’t any one thing—one variable, like housing prices moderating, that would really decide or decide against what we’re doing."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’ve got an overall test, which is greater confidence that inflation is moving down to 2 percent on a sustainable basis."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s our overall test.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"Or, alternatively, we see unexpected weakening in the labor market."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,So those are—those are two different tests.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"I would say, you know, we’re not— we’re not looking at any one price in any one sector and saying, “That’s the one.” We don’t target housing prices, for example."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,And we don’t target wages.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"We, we target aggregate prices and overall employment, so— NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"But if housing prices remain sticky, could that slow down the pace of rate cuts?"
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think you’d look at the over—we’d be looking at the aggregate numbers and, and asking ourselves, “What’s going on here with inflation in the—at the aggregate level?” And, you know—and, of course, if, if—any price that contributed to ongoing inflation would, would matter."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"Any price that contributed to ongoing disinflation would matter, too, but I wouldn’t single out housing as having a, a special role there."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you very much.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"Just one more question on housing—can you still cut rates with shelter prices high, or will you wait until they start to moderate a bit?"
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,Jennifer.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"Nancy Marshall-Genzer, with Marketplace."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,You have mentioned before the framework review process will start in the latter half of the year.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"At this point, do you have any specific time frame for the start of that?"
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,Who will lead it?
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,Will you be—will it be you or a member—a Committee group of your—of your peers?
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,What will be the parameters?
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,Do you anticipate the review will consider changes in communications going forward?
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we—what, what we’ve been thinking is that we would announce and commence the review later or late in the year."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"In the meantime, as that time approaches, we will be devoting a lot of careful thought and planning to the contours of it."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,Within scope would certainly be communications generally.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,I—I’m not going to say that we’ll look at this or that particular thing.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"And all the other details, you know—we’re just—we don’t want to get prematurely into a conversation until it’s really time to have it."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"And so, you know, I’m going to leave pretty much everything else to, to later in the year."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"Go to Nancy, for the last question."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Chair Powell."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,They couldn’t spend money.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know—and for, for our economy, what, you know, we’re trying to foster is maximum employment and price stability."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, and, you know, once, once we get inflation under control, rates can come down—which, which will also improve things."

2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,VICTORIA GUIDA.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,Hi.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,Victoria Guida with Politico.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, and, you know, the best thing we can do is, is to foster a very strong jobs economy, which we think we have done—ultimately to get inflation under control, because those people experience inflation, you know, very directly—very painfully."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"You’ve mentioned that unexpected weakening in the labor market would, would bring rate cuts sooner."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"Is it more of, like, a quicker pace of people losing jobs?"
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,Is it more the level of the unemployment rate if it were to start to go above 4.2 or something like that?
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,How are you thinking about what you’re looking for to see the job market unexpectedly weaken?
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know—you know, when I say “unexpectedly,” the first thing is more than, kind of, is in our forecast or in common forecasts—so, something more than that."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,But we’ll be looking at everything.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,And I was just wondering—can you talk a little bit about what that would look like?
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"We, we do see the same thing other people see, which is, you know, increasing financial pressures on, you know, more lower-income people."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, no, you’re, you’re right, though."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, overall, the economy is exhibiting solid growth, and, you know— something around 2 percent—which is—which is, you know, good—a good pace of growth for the U.S. economy."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"But households were in very, very strong—historically strong—financial shape."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,They’ve now worked off a lot of that.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we’re, we’re watching that carefully."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, what do we see?"
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s what we see.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"We, we see the same data that everybody else sees, but you’ve still got a household sector that’s in—that’s in pretty good shape."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know—but, nonetheless, it’s not in the kind of shape it was in a year or two ago."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we’re, you know—we’re carefully watching that."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,EDWARD LAWRENCE.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,So how close then are we to that point where the consumer can’t continue to spend as it’s spending or companies can’t hire like they’re hiring?
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,So consumer spending is still growing.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s not growing at the pace it was growing at a year or so ago, but, but it’s still—it’s still growing solidly."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, by the way, other parts of the economy are picking up."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"Spending on equipment and intangibles is—has picked up quite a bit, you know, in the wake of all the construction that we saw of new tech— you know, tech plants."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, we’ll—the, the labor market, you know, has the ability—has, has the tendency sometimes to, to weaken quickly."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"So waiting for that to happen is, is not what we’re doing."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, we’re watching very carefully; we’re looking at the balance of risks."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"I always point out the balance of risks, so—and, and also the fact that we look at, at all of it—the whole situation."

2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"I, I am Kosuke Takami, with Nikkei."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,I would like to know about the impact of a stronger dollar on U.S. economic growth and prices.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I have no doubt that markets should determine the exchange rate, but in—Japan and some emerging markets are suffering from the strong dollar."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,So I want to know if it is having a positive impact on U.S. economy in total?
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we don’t—actually, it’s our—it’s our finance ministry, the Treasury Department, that has a responsibility for thinking about and, and, if it sees fit, doing things about the level of the dollar."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"So for us, it’s just another financial variable."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"And you’re right—the dollar has been—has exhibited, exhibited some strength over the course of the last year or so because the U.S. economy is very strong."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"We don’t think of it as benefiting or hurting the U.S. We don’t—again, we don’t manage the level of the dollar."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"That’s, that’s not our— that’s not our job."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I, I don’t want to try to give you specific numbers of things, because that points to dates, and I, I just don’t think—we’re not at a point of being able to do that."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we feel like we’ve made good progress on, on both of those goals over the course of the past year."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"In terms of inflation, you know, you’d, you’d want to see real progress that builds your confidence that we’re—that we are on a path down to 2 percent."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s the whole.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, you know, a decision to begin to—you know, to loosen policy could have several reasons associated with it at a given time."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"But I, you know, I would just— you know, we monitor all the—all the labor market data."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"And if we saw troubling—weakening more than—more than expected, then that would be something we’d consider responding to."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"But we’d look at the—we look at the broader context of what’s going on, too."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,VICTORIA GUIDA.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,So something like negative payroll numbers would be— CHAIR POWELL.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"I’m not going to—yeah, I mean, I, I can think of things that would— many things would make it on that list, but I don’t think I’ll, I’ll utter them here."

2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"May I ask—you mentioned, with the slightly higher PCE [inflation] readings earlier this year, that it wasn’t one or two months but three months that tipped you to be a bit more cautious in the rate outlook."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"Should we take from that that—you know, it looks like May will be quite good for PCE [inflation], as it was for CPI—does that imply that kind of two more good months would reinstill the confidence that rate cuts could be coming sooner than you currently project?"
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, I, I don’t actually have that kind of mechanical thing in, in my thinking."

2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"Chair Powell, if I look at the, the rate projections, I see 15 of the 19 that are anticipating either one or two cut—two cuts this year—fairly evenly split between the two."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,And so I wonder if you could explain a little more the nuances or the differences there.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,Would two or three more inflation readings like the one that we saw this morning make a September interest rate cut possible?
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,Nick.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"So as far as the SEP part of that is concerned—as you know, I talk to—I talk to all of the other participants on the FOMC every cycle, and we talk about their Summary of Economic Projections and, and the dot plot—and, you know, their dot plot and everything."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"And in many cases, they’re—they’re thinking, “I don’t really”— you know, “I can’t really distinguish between two of these."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"They’re so close for me.” These are very close calls, but we ask them to write down the most likely one—so they do."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"And as, I think, you’ve, you’ve—as you’ve said, there’s 15 of the 19 are, are kind of clustered around one or two."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I think I would look at, at all—I’d look at all of them as plausible, but I’d look at—so I think that does tell you kind of what the Committee thinks."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"But what everyone agrees on is, it’s going to be data dependent."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,No one—no one brings to this or takes away from it that is on the Committee a really strong commitment to a particular rate path.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"And what you—what I hear and see is that people are looking at, at, you know, a range of plausible outcomes."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"If you’re at 2.6, 2.7 [percent], you know, that’s, that’s a really good place to be."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"If we get, you know, good—better readings than that, then you will see that come down or, or remain the same."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"Now, do we have high confidence that that’s right?"
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,No.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s just the kind of conservative way for forecasting things.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"If we were to get more readings like today’s reading, then, of course, that wouldn’t be the case."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,So it’s just a forecasting device.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think, I think—let me say that we welcome today’s reading and then hope for more like that."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,STEVE LIESMAN.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"But if it comes in—just to follow up—if it comes in the way you forecast it, it would seem strange for you to be cutting rates at all in context of a rising core PCE."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,Yeah—no.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mean, I think we’ve, we’ve—what we said is that we don’t think it’ll be appropriate to, to reduce rates and begin to loosen policy until we have more confidence that inflation is moving back down to 2 percent on a—on a sustainable basis."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,And that’s the—that’s the test we’ve applied.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,I don’t know that—I think if we—I don’t know that this rules that in or out.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mean, really, it’s, it’s a forecast—a fairly conservative forecast month by month that would lead to slightly higher, you know, 12-months rates by the end of the year."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s actually just their forecast and their—it’s a combination of their forecast and their own reaction function.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, again, everyone would say that this is very data dependent, and I don’t hold it with high confidence."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I think if you’re looking for—and, and don’t really think that they’re—they’re not trying to send a strong signal that “this is what I think is the right thing.” It’s just what they think at a given moment in time, subject to data."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"In terms of, you know, future meetings, we haven’t, you know—we don’t—we don’t try to—we don’t make decisions about future meetings until we get there."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think we’ll, you know—you will see PPI tomorrow."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,We’ll know more about the PCE [inflation] reading as the month goes on.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"But the initial CPI reading and its, you know, kind of first-level translation to, to PCE [inflation] we did have this morning."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"We were briefed about it, and people were able to consider whether they should make changes."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, as I said, you know, some people generally do, but most people generally don’t."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.

2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,JONNELLE MARTE.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Chair Powell."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,Jonnelle Marte from Bloomberg.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"As you noted, the labor market is now in many ways back to where it was before the pandemic."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,I wondered if you could comment on how officials are viewing that.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"So do you think that there still needs to be more cooling in the labor market to bring inflation all the way down to 2 percent, or is there any sense that maybe the labor market is more vulnerable now to higher rates now that many of those imbalances have eased?"
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,Sure.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"So that, you know—what’s in the SEP actually does reflect the data that we got today to the extent you can, you know, reflect it in one day."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"And if you put that on top of where we are now, you get a very slight increase in the 12-month—in the 12-month, you know, reading."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"But I’m not going to get into the specifics, but you have the ability to do that."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, and some people do; some people don’t."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think in terms of what we need to see, I mentioned it earlier—we, we want to—we want to gain further confidence."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"Certainly, more good inflation readings will help with that."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"I’m not going to be specific about how many because, you know, really, it’s going to be not just the inflation rating—readings—it’s going to be the totality of the data: what’s happening in the labor market, what’s happening with the balance of risks, what’s happening with the forecast, what’s happening with growth."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"You look at all of that, and you ask, “Are we confident?"
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"Have we reached an appropriate level of confidence that inflation is moving down sustainably to 2 percent, or, alternatively, do we see really unexpected signs of weakness in the labor market that would call for a response?”—which is—which is another thing that could, could happen."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, again, we don’t see that."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I—we do see today’s—we see today’s report as, as progress and as, you know, building confidence."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"But we, we don’t see ourselves as having the confidence that would warrant—you know, that would warrant beginning to, to loosen policy at this time."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,NICK TIMIRAOS.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"And if I could quickly follow up—did, did you or any of your colleagues change your interest rate projections after 8:30 or whenever you got the inflation numbers today?"
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we—this happens too often, but it, it does happen."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"It just is, you know—data came—I think it happened a couple of meetings ago—a few meetings ago."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"So when that happens—when there’s an important data print during the meeting, first day or second day— what we do is, we, we make sure people remember that they have the ability to update."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,We tell them how to do that.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"Most, most people don’t."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"So by, by so many measures, the labor market was, was kind of overheated two years ago."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’re assuming, you know, good, but not great, numbers."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,The new reading gets added to the 12-month window.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"Nominal wage growth has eased over the past year, and the jobs-to-workers gap has narrowed."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"Overall, a broad set of indicators suggests that conditions in the labor market have returned to about where they stood on the eve of the pandemic—relatively tight but not overheated."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,FOMC participants expect labor market strength to continue.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,The median unemployment rate projection in the SEP is 4.0 percent at the end of this year and 4.2 percent at the end of next year.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,Inflation has eased notably over the past two years but remains above our longer-run goal of 2 percent.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"Total PCE prices rose 2.7 percent over the 12 months ending in April; excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 2.8 percent."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"Strong job creation over the past couple of years has been accompanied by an increase in the supply of workers, reflecting increases in participation among individuals aged 25 to 54 years and a continued strong pace of immigration."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"The consumer price index—which came out this morning and tends to run higher than the PCE, PCE price index— rose 3.3 percent over the 12 months ending in May, and the core CPI rose 3.4 percent."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"Longer-term inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households and businesses and forecasters, as well as measures from financial markets."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"The median projection in the SEP for total PCE inflation is 2.6 percent this year, 2.3 percent next year, and 2.0 percent in 2026."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"My colleagues and I are acutely aware that high inflation imposes significant hardship, as it erodes purchasing power, especially for those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,Our monetary policy actions are guided by our dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"In support of these goals, the Committee decided at today’s meeting to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 5¼ to 5½ percent and to continue reducing our securities holdings."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"As labor market tightness has eased and inflation has declined over the past year, the risks to achieving our employment and inflation goals have moved toward better balance."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"The inflation data received earlier this year were higher than expected, though more recent monthly readings have eased somewhat."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,The unemployment rate ticked up but remains low at 4 percent.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"Payroll job gains averaged 218,000 jobs per month in April and May, a pace that is still strong but a bit below that seen in the first quarter."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"In the labor market, supply and demand conditions have come into better balance."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"Transcript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference June 12, 2024 CHAIR POWELL."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,Good afternoon.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,Chris.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,Our economy has made considerable progress toward both goals over the past two years.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"The labor market has come into better balance, with continued strong job gains and a low unemployment rate."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,Inflation has eased substantially from a peak of 7 percent to 2.7 percent but is still too high.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,We are strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent goal in support of a strong economy that benefits everyone.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"Today, the FOMC decided to leave our policy interest rate unchanged and to continue to reduce our securities holdings."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,We are maintaining our restrictive stance of monetary policy in order to keep demand in line with supply and reduce inflationary pressures.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,I’ll have more to say about monetary policy after briefly reviewing economic developments.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"Although GDP growth moderated from 3.4 percent in the fourth quarter of last year to 1.3 percent in the first quarter, private domestic final purchases—which excludes inventory investment, government spending, and net exports and usually sends a clearer signal on underlying demand—grew at 2.8 percent in the first quarter, nearly as strong as the second half of 2023."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,Growth of consumer spending has slowed from last year’s robust pace but remains solid.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,And investment in equipment and intangibles has picked up from its anemic pace last year.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,Improving supply conditions have supported resilient demand and the strong performance of the U.S. economy over the past year.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"In our Summary of Economic Projections, Committee participants generally expect GDP growth to slow from last year’s pace, with a median projection of 2.1 percent this year and 2.0 percent over the next two years."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"The economic outlook is uncertain, however, and we remain highly attentive to inflation risks."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,We’ve stated that we do not expect it will be appropriate to reduce the target range for the federal funds rate until we have gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2 percent.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"So far this year, the data have not given us that greater confidence."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"The most recent inflation readings have been more favorable than earlier in the year, however, and there has been modest further progress toward our inflation objective."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you, and I look forward to your questions."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,Steve.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,STEVE LIESMAN.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"Steve Liesman, CNBC."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,Just wondering if you could walk me through the Committee’s average inflation forecast—core PCE is now forecast to be 2.8 percent by the year-end.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s already 2.75, and after today’s number, there were several forecasts on the street that it would be 2.6 at the end of this month."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"Does that tell you that the average official expects no further progress in inflation and, in fact, that it’s going to get worse?"
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"And if you have this wrong, doesn’t it mean that you sort of—you, you could have wrong the outlook for rates there?"
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,Yeah.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"So what’s going on there is that we had very low readings in the second half of last year—June through December, really."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,And we’re now lapping those.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"So as you go through the 12-month window, a very low reading drops out, and a new reading comes in."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum-employment and price-stability goals.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"So it’s just a, a slight element of conservativism that we’re, we’re assuming a certain level of—of, you know, incoming monthly PCE and core PCE numbers."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,Everything we do is in service to our public mission.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,Our success in delivering on these goals matters to all Americans.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,We will need to see more good data to bolster our confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2 percent.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,We know that reducing policy restraint too soon or too much could result in a reversal of the progress that we’ve seen on inflation.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"At the same time, reducing policy restraint too late or too little could unduly weaken economic activity and employment."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"In considering any adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"In our SEP, FOMC participants wrote down their individual assessments of an appropriate path for the federal funds rate, based on what each participant judges to be the most likely scenario going forward."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"If the economy evolves as expected, the median participant projects that the appropriate level of the federal funds rate will be 5.1 percent at the end of this year, 4.1 percent at the end of 2025, and 3.1 percent at the end of 2026."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,But these projections are not a Committee plan or any kind of a decision.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"As the economy evolves, assessments of the appropriate policy, policy path will adjust in order to best promote our maximum-employment and price-stability goals."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"If the economy remains solid and inflation persists, we’re prepared to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate as long as appropriate."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"If the labor market were to weaken unexpectedly or if inflation were to fall more quickly than anticipated, we’re prepared to respond."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,Policy is well positioned to deal with the risks and uncertainties that we face in pursuing both sides of our dual mandate.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’ll continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting, based on the totality of the data and its implications for the outlook and the balance of risks."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,The Fed has been assigned two goals for monetary policy—maximum employment and stable prices.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,We remain committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal and to keeping longer-term inflation expectations well anchored.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,Restoring price stability is essential to achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the long run.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"We understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,And we’ve seen it gradually move back into much better balance between supply and demand.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,My colleagues and I remain squarely focused on achieving our dual-mandate goals of maximum employment and stable prices for the benefit of the American people.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,We’ve seen labor force supply come up quite a bit through immigration and through recovering participation.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, so just to follow up on that—I think one, one curious thing here is, you’ve got now this restrictive policy in place and virtually no change in any of the major things for all of this year."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"You’ve got growth that stays above long-run potential throughout the forecast period, unemployment that never goes above the long-run estimate— right?—of 4.2."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,So this isn’t a story of slack improving inflation.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,So where’s the improvement in inflation coming from that it’s going to pick up pace so much in 2025?
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"Well, you know, it’s been coming—where’s it been coming from— let’s start with that."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,HOWARD SCHNEIDER.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, clearly a lot of what—some of what we’ve been getting is just the reversal of the—the unwinding of the pandemic-related distortions to both supply and demand."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,So those two things have been working together.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,We’ve also had a very positive supply shock on the labor side.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, and, also, you get—you get a positive supply shock when the—when the supply conditions unwind and return to normal."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"So you’ve had, you know, above-trend potential growth and, and high growth."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"And yet you’ve had the benefit of, of inflation coming down, you know, really fast, actually, last year, and you will see what the rest of this year brinks—brings."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,So these dynamics can continue as long as they continue.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"And that is, you know—that is complemented by and amplified—supported by restrictive monetary policy."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,And that’s why we’ve been at this policy rate now for almost a year.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we look at today’s thing, and we think, “Well, that’s a good reading, and we hope we get more like that.” And, you know, in the meantime, we’re asking, “Is our policy stance about right?” And I think we think, “Yes, it’s about right.” We’re prepared to adjust that as appropriate, but we think—we think we’re getting the things that we would want to get, broadly speaking."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"And then for a while, there was a pause."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"But I think for the reasons I’ve talked about at the last press conference and, and other places, I think the evidence is pretty clear that policy is restrictive and is having, you know, the effects that we would hope for."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,Howard.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,HOWARD SCHNEIDER.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thanks, Chair Powell."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"Howard Schneider, with Reuters."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"Just to—just to carry that a little further, should we read this as a conclusion that the combination of tipping to one cut this year and acknowledging further progress on inflation as kind of a mark to market on the level of restrictiveness that you need—that you, in fact, have concluded that you weren’t quite there yet?"
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,I’d be reluctant to try to draw that conclusion.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"I, I think this is about, you know, looking at the incoming data and asking, “How much progress are we making on inflation, and how is the rest of the economy doing?"
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,Is the labor market still strong?” That’s what we’re thinking about.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, you can—you can translate it into the—into the language you’re talking about, but, to me, the focus is more on, we have a goal, which is price stability, and another goal, which is maximum employment."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,How are we doing there?
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"We think we’ve got a good, strong labor market still."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,We think we’ve been making progress toward the price- stability goal.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mean, ultimately, the question is, ultimately, are you down to demand?"
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, and we don’t know that, though."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mean, look at today’s report."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, if we see more like that—you know, we don’t—we can’t know what the future holds."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, that’s why we’re watching so carefully for signs of weakness."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,We don’t really see that.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"We kind of see what we wanted to see, which was gradual cooling in demand—gradual rebalancing in the labor market while we’re continuing to make progress on inflation."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,So we’re getting—we’re getting good results here.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHAEL MCKEE.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, to follow up: Is there any kind of concern for the housing industry or financial stability—banks—in leaving rates where they are for too long at this point?"
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"On housing—you know, the housing situation is a complicated one."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"And you can see that’s a place where rates are really having, having a significant effect."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mean, ultimately, the best thing we can do for the housing market is to bring inflation down so that we can bring rates down so that the housing market can continue to normalize."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"There will still be a national housing shortage, as there was before the pandemic."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"There will still be one, but the distortions that we see now with lock-ins and things like that—you know, low mortgages—in terms of banks, the banking system has been, you know, solid, strong, well capitalized."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"Lending—you know, we’ve seen good performance by the banks."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"So the banking system, you know, seems to be—seems to be in good shape."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, what have we seen?"
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, so far, they haven’t had to."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"The question of whether it’s sufficiently restrictive is going to be one we, we know over time."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"Now, ultimately, we think rates will have to come down to continue to support that."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,And that’s what we’ve been getting.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"But in the meantime, we’ve made pretty good progress on inflation with our current stance."

2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHAEL MCKEE.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,Michael McKee from Bloomberg Radio and Television.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"The base case of the Committee seems to be that there is going to be at least one rate cut this year, but your growth forecast doesn’t see any slowdown in the rest of the year, nor does the unemployment forecast see any significant weakening of the labor market."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,And your inflation forecasts basically average out to no change.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"So if, at the end of the year, there is no change from conditions now, why would you anticipate cutting rates?"
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"What, what would be the point for a rate cut?"
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"Well, we think—we think policy is restrictive."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we think, ultimately, that if you—if you just set policy at a restrictive level, eventually you will see real weakening in the economy."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"So that’s always been the thought is that, you know, since we raise rates this far, we’ve, we’ve always been pointing to cuts at a certain point."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"Not to eliminate the possibility of hikes, but, you know, no one has that as their base case, so—no one on the Committee does."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"But so that’s, that’s—you know, that’s how we think about it."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"That’s what we’ve been getting is good progress on inflation, with growth at a—at a, a good level and with a strong labor market."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, my answer has been that policy is restrictive."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"We had the turmoil earlier last year, but, you know, banks have been focusing on bringing up their liquidity, bringing up their capital, and having a risk—risk-management plans in place."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"But in the meantime, we’re making policy with the economy that we have—with the distortions that we have."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,So sometimes it’s—you can’t reconcile the differences.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"You just have to, have to—have to look at it and, and try to understand."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"And that’s why it always makes sense to look at a series, you know, in 6—in 3, 6, and 12 months of things rather than just one report."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"But you’re right to point to the last report, where it was your—job losses in the household survey—job gains, big job gains in the establishment survey."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, I mean, we’re left with ambiguous results, and we have to deal with that uncertainty around data."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"Nonetheless, the overall picture is one of a strong and gradually cooling—gradually rebalancing labor market."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I, I also—to your other point, I, I think it is—it is the case that as time has gone by, the question of “How restrictive is policy?” has become one that everyone’s asking, and we’re asking it, too."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"Job openings, while they’ve come way down, are still, you know, greater than the number of unemployed people."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, overall, we’re looking at what is still a very strong labor market but not the superheated labor market of two years ago or even one year ago."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,Neil.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,NEIL IRWIN.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thanks, Chair Powell."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"Neil Irwin, with Axios."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,The jobs–workers gap is still a significantly positive number—greater than it was before the pandemic.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"So how do you interpret that, and, and how does it change your view on the labor market?"
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"There’s been some divergence, especially, we saw, in the last report that we got on Friday."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"As a quick follow-up—the surveys that make up the jobs report are, are showing different tales."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"But still, we’ve had some increases in prime-age labor force."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"That’s ongoing, mostly now through the immigration channel."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"In terms of on the demand side, you know, we’ve seen—well, we’ve seen quits moving down."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,We’ve seen job openings moving down.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’ve seen wage increases moving from very, very high levels a couple of years ago back down to more sustainable levels."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"We have seen unemployment creep up now sixth-tenths over the course of, of a year or so very, very gradually."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"So you put all that together—what you have is still-low unemployment, still 4 percent unemployment—historically low."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"But it’s moved up a little bit—it’s softened a bit—and, and, you know, that’s an important statistic."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, but more than that, you’ve got strong job creation."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"You, you have payroll jobs still coming in strong, even though, you know, there’s an argument that they may be a bit overstated but still they’re, they’re still—they’re strong."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,So that’s what we see.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"We, we watch the labor market, of course, and the economy as a whole—but the labor market very carefully—and that’s what we see."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,We see gradual cooling—gradual moving toward better balance.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’re monitoring it carefully for signs of, of something more than that, but we really don’t see that."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,JONNELLE MARTE.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,Back on the rates path: The SEP showed quite a large shift of rate cut expectations relative to March—that’s a period in which the economic data flow hasn’t been that dramatic a shift.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"How, how—can you provide some color on what changed in the attitudes on the Committee over the last three months to, to see a much shallower path of rate cuts this year?"
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,Yeah.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, how should we interpret what that means about how the Committee views its current policy setting?"
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"So two things about that—one, one is this—you’re right, it did move up."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, but I want to remember to point out that the long-run neutral rate of interest is, is a long-run concept."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"It, it really is a theoretical concept—can’t be directly observed."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"And what it is is the, the interest rate that would hold the economy at equilibrium—maximum employment and price stability—potentially, potentially years in the future where there are no shocks."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,So it’s— it’s a little bit—it’s not something we observe today.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,Today we’ve got a very specific economy with all kinds of shocks we’re still getting over from the pandemic.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"So it’s—I, I don’t think that the, the concept of r-star—it’s a very important concept in economics and in what we do."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, honestly, it doesn’t really get you where you need to be to think about what appropriate policy is in the near term."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"But I, I—back to your original question, people have been gradually writing it up because I just think people are coming to the view that rates aren’t—are less likely to go down to their, their pre-pandemic levels, which were, you know, very low by recent history measures."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"Now, we, we can’t really know that."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"That’s, that’s an interesting dispute and discussion to have now, but, ultimately, we think that things like the neutral rate are driven by longer-run, slow-moving forces."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"That’s been the debate, and we can’t know."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,I wonder if we should read that as a sign that you think that policy is not sort of as restrictive as we’ve previously expected.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"In the Summary of Economic Projections, the long-run interest rate forecast moved up a bit."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, there’s a really good question about whether, whether those really have changed or whether, instead, rates and the economy are experiencing a, a series of persistent but, ultimately, temporary shocks."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"Jeanna Smialek, New York Times."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks for taking our questions.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,So the inflation forecast moved up several tenths for the end of the year.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, and, as I mentioned earlier, in the, you know—what, what did we take away from this?"
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"We had really, really good inflation data in the second half of last year, then kind of a pause in progress in the first quarter."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,And what we took away from that was that it’s probably going to take longer to get the confidence that we need to begin to loosen policy.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"So the sense of that is that rate cuts that might take place in—might’ve taken place this year—take place next year, you know?"
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"We, we—there are—there are fewer rate cuts in the median this year, but there’s one more next year."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, so you really—if you look at year-end 2025 and ’26, you’re, you’re almost exactly where you would have been, just it—just it’s moved later because of that progress."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,The big thing that changed was the inflation forecast.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,So we’ll have to see where the data light the way.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, we’re, we’re—the economy has, you know, repeatedly surprised forecasters in both directions, and today was certainly a better inflation report than almost anybody expected."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we’ll just have to see what, what—what the incoming data flow brings and, and how that affects the outlook and the balance of risks."
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,Jeanna.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,JEANNA SMIALEK.
2024-06-12,Press Conf - Full Text,"Now, you get another—you get data—different data today."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"The aggregate data is—particularly PDFP, private domestic final purchases—is 2.6 percent, and that’s a good indicator of private—of private demand."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we listen to all of that, and it does, does—I think it’s important to listen to anecdotal data and not just look at the aggregate data."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"Especially, you know, it’s very hard—GDP data can be volatile quarter to quarter."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,So it’s just hard to measure economic activity.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,There are a lot of—it’s just difficult to do.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I look at both, but I wouldn’t say that the—that the anecdotal data is uniformly downbeat."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Jo Ling.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,JO LING KENT.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Jo Ling Kent with CBS News.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"Chair Powell, thanks for taking our questions today."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s one of there are spots of weakness, and there are regions where growth is stronger than other regions, but, overall, it’s—again, look at the aggregate data."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,You have consistently said that the Fed does not consider politics in making decisions.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s more mixed.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"But I’ll tell you, it’s a pretty—the picture is, is not one of a slowing or, you know, a really bad economy."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,AMARA OMEOKWE.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I do take that seriously, and the Beige Book is great."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"There are many, many examples, so it’s never exactly the same."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"Also, let’s remember that this pandemic era has been one in which so many, you know, apparent rules have been flouted, like the inverted yield curve for starters."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, many, many received—pieces of received wisdom just haven’t worked, and it’s because this situation really is unusual or unique in that so much of this inflation came from the shutdown of the economy and the resulting supply problems in the face of, admittedly, very strong demand."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,So the whole—the whole situation is not the same as many of the other prior inflation or downturns that we’ve seen or business cycles that we’ve seen.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,So we’re having to learn.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’re having to, to be very careful about the judgments that we make, I would say."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"What’s even greater is hearing the Reserve Bank presidents come in and talk about their conversations with, with businesses and business leaders and workers and people in the nonprofit sector in their Districts."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we don’t assume that these regularities will, will just repeat themselves automatically."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Amara.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you, Chair Powell."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Amara Omeokwe with Bloomberg.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"There seems to be quite a difference between what the anecdotal data are telling us, such as the very recent downbeat Beige Book, and the hard data."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"Do you take those anecdotes seriously— that is, that the economy and labor market are cooling much more rapidly than what’s shown in the data?"
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"With a possible September rate cut on the table, it would be less than two months before the election, and former President Trump reportedly said that cutting rates so close to the election is something the central bank knows “they shouldn’t be doing.” What’s your response, and do you believe it’s possible to really remain apolitical with a September rate cut?"
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,We don’t know what they’re going to do.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"I absolutely do, and I think it’s—first of all, we haven’t made any decisions."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Everyone will benefit.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"So that’s what we believe, and that’s how we will always act."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,This is my fourth presidential election at the Fed.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,I can tell you this is how we think about it.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,This is what we do.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"So anything that we do before, during, or after the election will be based on the data, the outlook, and the balance of risks and not on anything else."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Wages will rise in real terms.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,No.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,We do not do that.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,We absolutely do not do that.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,We don’t— we don’t know who’s going to win.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"We don’t act as though we know, and we just can’t do that, you know?"
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"Just a quick follow-up—do your economic forecasts and models take into account the two very different economic plans of these two presidential candidates, Harris and Trump, and, if so, how?"
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,People will find jobs.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,We’ll have price stability.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"If we get it right, the economy will be stronger."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,I would say it this way: haven’t made any decision about any future meeting.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,I don’t know what the data will reveal or how that will affect the appropriate path of our policy.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,I really don’t know.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,I do know how we will make that assessment.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s what I do know.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"So if you take a step back, the current situation, again, is inflation has come down much closer to our goal, and that’s happened while unemployment has remained low."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’re, we’re very tightly focused on using our tools to try to foster that state of affairs continuing."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"That’s at each of our meetings and all of our decisions, our focus is strictly on that and really on nothing else—doing our part, whatever that part may be."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, we’re using our best thinking."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,We’re doing our best to understand the economy.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"We, we follow academics."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"We follow the many commentators who bless us with their commentary [laughter], but we don’t change anything in our approach to address other factors, like the political calendar."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"Congress has, we believe, ordered us to conduct our business in a nonpolitical way at all times, not just some of the time."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"I’ll say this, too: We never use our tools to support or oppose a political party, a politician, or any political outcome."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"The bottom line is, if we do our very best to do our part and we stick to our part, that will benefit all Americans."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"An example would be, is there a trend increase in the level of vacancies?"
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,We’re certainly very well positioned to respond to weakness with the policy rate at 5.3 percent.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,That statement is very true about the economy.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"Yes, it does."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I think the lags have kind of showed up here in the last six months, by the way."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"You, you really do now see the restriction, whereas, I mean, even a few months ago, people were questioning how restrictive policy was."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Look at the labor market now—you can see.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"And look at inflation—sorry—rate-sensitive, interest-sensitive spending."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,You really do see now that policy is restrictive.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"I wouldn’t say it’s extremely restrictive, but it’s certainly effectively restrictive."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"It should take some time to get into—to get into the full economy, affect financial conditions."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"And that affects economic activity, hiring and that kind of thing, and, ultimately, inflation."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"It doesn’t—it’s not instantaneous, although it’s faster than it used to be because markets move now in anticipation of our moves."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,COURTENAY BROWN.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"So are you worried then that if monetary policy acts with long and variable lags, even when you’re lowering interest rates, it might be too late for the Fed to help stave off any kind of slowdown in the labor market or broader economy?"
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"Yes, there—the lag should, should be on the way down."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,How are you and the Committee thinking about that?
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"I wonder if that applies on the way down, too."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"When the Fed was raising rates, there was a lot of conversation about long and variable lags."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s a very difficult judgment call, but this is—this is how we’re making it."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,We basically—we have our forecast.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"So—but in terms of today, your question about today, we did have a—you know, we had a nice conversation about, about this issue today."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"The overall sense of the Committee, as I mentioned, is that we’re getting closer to the point at which it will be appropriate to begin to dial back restriction, but we’re not quite at that point yet."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,We want to see more good data.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,The decision was unanimous—all 19 participants supported it.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"But there was a real discussion back and forth of what the case would be for, for moving at this meeting."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,A strong majority supported moving—not moving at this meeting.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,That was the strong sense of the Committee.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"But it’s a conversation that we had today, certainly."

2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you for taking our questions.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,We have to worry about that.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,You never assume it’s going to be just the same.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mean, we—just to make it clear, you know, it’s a very difficult, challenging judgment, and we don’t want to go too soon, and we don’t want to go too late."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,I feel good about where we are.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, and the answer is, we’re watching really carefully for that."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’re, we’re aware of that rule, which is really a, you know, a—I would call it a statistical, statistical thing that has happened through history."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,A “statistical regularity” is what I’d call it.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s not like an economic rule where it’s telling you something must happen.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, again, what do we see?"
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,What are our eyes telling us?
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"We—so I would just say, the question really is, is one of, are we worried about a sharper downturn in the labor market?"
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"We look at—we look at all the things we’re seeing, and what it looks like is a normalizing labor market—again, job creation at a pretty decent level, wages moving up at a strong level but coming down gradually."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, again, I’ve been through some of the data already, but what we think we’re seeing is, is a normalizing labor market, and we’re watching carefully to see if it—if it turns out to be more."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"If it starts to show signs that it’s more than that, then we’re well positioned to respond."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,VICTORIA GUIDA.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Is there reason to think that the labor market might behave differently this time than it has historically?
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think, you know, history doesn’t repeat itself; it rhymes."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"Job vacancies have come down, but they’re still high by historical standards."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"On the labor market, I was wondering, how worried are you all about unemployment rising to the point where it triggers the Sahm rule, and would that potentially affect how quickly you cut rates?"
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Victoria Guida with Politico.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,We certainly have a lot of room to respond if we were to see weakness.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"That’s not what we’re seeing, though."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,What we’re seeing—look at the—look at the first-half growth numbers.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Look at PDFP at 2.6 percent for the first half.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s not signaling a weak economy.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s also not signaling an overheating economy.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"Labor market—admittedly, the unemployment rate has moved up seven-tenths, and we’re seeing—we’re seeing normalization there, but wage, wage increases are still at a high level."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Unemployment is still at a low level.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Layoffs are very low.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"Initial claims have moved up, but they’re pretty stable, and they’re historically not high at all."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"So the total scope of the data suggests a normalizing labor market, and, again, we are carefully watching to see that that continues to be the case."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Victoria.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,VICTORIA GUIDA.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Hi.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,But that’s—this is how we made that judgment.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’re not—we can run simulations of different potential policies, but we would never try to make policy decisions based on the outcome of an election that hasn’t happened yet."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"So this is the judgment that we have to make, and we’re, we’re well aware of the judgment."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, we’re a nonpolitical agency."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I think we’re—if we are to respond to weakness, we’re certainly, you know, well equipped to do that."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,But that’s not what we’re seeing.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"What we’re seeing is strong economic activity and, you know, a good labor market and inflation coming down."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Greg.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,GREG ROBB.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, we’re, we’re watching to see, you know, which way the economy heads."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you so much.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, and when I talked to the commentators who bless you with their comments [laughter], they say that they really don’t have a sense of what is going to judge, maybe not the first cut, but the pace of the cuts going forward."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,They don’t have a good sense of that.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"Is there anything you can say, like how will we judge that?"
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"Yeah, I mean, I think the reality is that, that forecasters—and this isn’t just the Fed by any means—forecasters have been continually surprised by, for example, the strength of the economy last year."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I think we had to be pretty humble about, about giving forward guidance about this, that, and the other thing."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"In the—in the minutes of the June meeting that came out a few weeks ago, there was a discussion about communications, and some Fed officials said maybe the Fed wasn’t as clear enough about its reaction function."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s, it’s kind of what you would want to see, but, of course, the job is never done."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s not—it’s neither an overheating economy, nor is it a sharply weakening economy."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"And so that’s, that’s really what you see."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,We said we needed to see more.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Then we saw some higher inflation.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’ve seen one quarter of good inflation, and we’ve seen the labor market move quite a bit."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, as I mentioned, I don’t think it needs to cool off anymore for us to get the inflation results that are related to the labor market—not all inflation is, of course."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I think it’s a difficult judgment to make, and what you see is the judgment of the Committee is that that time is drawing near."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"That time could be in September if, if the data support that."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,And have the chances of a hard landing increased?
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I, I don’t know whether they’ve increased."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,I think they’re low.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,I think this is—you don’t see any reason to think that this economy is either overheating or sharply weakening.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s just not in the data right now.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"What’s in the data right now is an economy that’s growing at a—at a solid pace, a labor market that has cooled off, but, nonetheless, inflation—sorry, unemployment is low."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,The data overall show a strong labor market.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,We need to be pretty careful about that.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,We didn’t.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, when you’re saying you’re going to be data driven, of course, it’s always what the data—how they affect the outlook and the balance of risks, but it’s—nobody has great vision deep into the future."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think people have understood for a long time, actually, that we were very focused on bringing down inflation."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,There’s not much going on at all.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,We’re not—we don’t have the authority to issue a CB—a retail CBDC that’s available to the public.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,We’re not seeking that authority.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,So what we’re doing is keeping up with—keeping up with developments there.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"Pretty much every major central bank in the world is at least doing, doing that."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Some of them are actually seriously looking at implementing a CBDC.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"In terms of a CBDC, there’s really nothing new going on."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,We’re really not.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I think it’s work that we need to be doing, which could be very beneficial down the road, but we don’t have—on a CBDC, we don’t have any plan to."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"We would need to go to Congress, and we have no plan to do that."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,We’re not—no one here has decided that we think it’s a good idea yet.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,There’s no guarantee in this.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’re really just evaluating, you know, the story and what’s happening out there."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"And so we have people who are researching that and trying to keep up to speed, because we play an important role in the payments sector, both as a convener and as an operator, too."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, it’s something that’s going to really change the way—it’s going to make more efficient and, hopefully, safer and all those things— the way payments are made around the world."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, more broadly, digital finance is an area that’s having—that has really significant implications for payments generally, instant payments."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Nobody was really confused about that.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"The data have, you know— again, we’ve seen significant improvement in inflation just for the last quarter."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"Markets move around on that—on the data, really."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Not so much—it’s not really what we’re going to do.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s more just that the data keep coming in, and markets are very, very responsive to that data right now."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Go to Jeff for the last question.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,JEFF COX.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,I’m going to change gears on you just a little bit from all of the rate talk and whatnot.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"With FedNow being in the books for a little over a year, there hasn’t been a whole lot of talk about central bank digital currency and wondering if you could give us an update on where things are with that."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Is that considered a dead issue now?
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"Is it still something that’s being discussed within the Committee, and what, what’s happening with that?"
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s not something that comes up at all with the—in the FOMC.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"In terms of a reaction function, that’s a—that’s a long-time discussion that people have had forever."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,We would just—that would just be a line we would never cross.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"If we go too soon, we can—we had a lot of advice, you know, to go ahead and cut after the seven good months of last year."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’ve had—we’ve had, you know, dissents."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"We haven’t had so many during the pandemic era, and it just may be that we, we felt more united because we felt under a lot of pressure to get things right, but before the pandemic, we had plenty of dissents."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,And dissents happen.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s part of the process.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"There’s nothing wrong with dissents, and if it happens, it happens."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"No single person has a veto, so it just is a question of, who will vote for and against?"
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Jean.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Hello.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Jean Yung with MNI Market News.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Is a 50 basis point cut as a first cut at all likely or even on the table?
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, I don’t want to say—I don’t want to be really specific about what we’re going to do, but that’s, that’s not something we’re thinking about right now."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,JEAN YUNG.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, no one has a veto."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s fine.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,There are dissents.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"We don’t want to be involved in any—in politics in any way, so we wouldn’t do that."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Nicholas.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,NICHOLAS JASINSKI.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you, Chair Powell."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Nicholas Jasinski from Barron’s Magazine.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,There hasn’t been a dissenting vote on an interest rate decision in some time.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"If the data do evolve as you expect, if you do have more confidence by the September meeting, do you get the sense that there will be a unanimous vote on an interest rate move in September?"
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"Basically, are there meaningful differences in Committee members’ assessments of how much more confidence is needed?"
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,So there’s—there are always meaningful differences.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,There are.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, we talk a lot before, during, and after the meeting."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,We do have a very robust discussion of these things.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"You’re right that in, in most cases, people, if they feel heard and they feel that they’ve—that their position has been given serious consideration, for most people, most of the time, that’s going to be enough."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’re—as I’ve said, we have to weigh the risk of going too soon against the risk of going too late."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Jennifer.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"Of course, we haven’t made any decisions at all as of today."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Yes.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,JENNIFER SCHONBERGER.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,—assuming inflation comes?
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"Well, assuming that the totality of the data supports such an outcome."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,No question.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,But there is a growing sense of confidence that you could move at the next meeting— CHAIR POWELL.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"That’s, that is the case, as I mentioned."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Nancy.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Chair Powell."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Nancy Marshall-Genzer with Marketplace.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"Former New York president Bill Dudley wrote an op-ed in Bloomberg earlier this month, which you probably saw, in which he said, “It might already be too late to fend off a recession by cutting rates, dawdling now unnecessarily increases the risk.” Is he wrong?"
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"We think that the time is, is— it’s approaching, and if we do get the data that we—that we hope we get, then a reduction in our policy rate could be on the table at the September meeting."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,JENNIFER SCHONBERGER.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I would also say, some people examined the possibility, you know, the case for moving at this meeting, but, overwhelmingly, the sense of the Committee was not at this meeting but as soon as the next meeting, depending on how the data come in."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, at the end, everyone, everyone supported the outcome—not just the voters, but everyone."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,JENNIFER SCHONBERGER.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you, Chair Powell."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Jennifer Schonberger with Yahoo Finance.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"Not to get into the minutes, but you said there was a real discussion today for moving at this meeting."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,I’m curious if you could provide some more color on the nature of the discussion today at the meeting about a possible rate cut as early as September.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"Well, so, you know, the way the meeting is set up, the first day there’s a discussion of financial stability because it’s every other meeting we have that, and then we have an opportunity to comment on that."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Then we have an economic go-round.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"And then, this morning, we have the monetary policy go-round."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I think in people’s economic or in their monetary policy go-round, people express their views about this, and, you know, there’s a range of views."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,People—as you will know from the speeches that they give—people have different ways of thinking about the economy.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"And so, in the minutes, we’ll lay this out in a much—in a much better way than I can do off the cuff, but there’s a range of perspectives."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know—but I do think that we are, we’re a consensus-driven organization."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,People come together.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,This was a unanimous—a unanimous decision.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s what we’re doing.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,JO LING KENT.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,And now we’ve got another quarter—a quarter that is good.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,COLBY SMITH.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Colby Smith with the Financial Times.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"The March SEP pointed to three cuts in 2024, with core inflation at 2.6 percent and the unemployment rate at 4 percent."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"Since we’re now at that level in terms of inflation and already beyond what was projected for the labor market, I’m just wondering if that rate path is back to being the best guidepost for policy rather than, let’s say, the shallower one laid out in that June SEP."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Colby.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, so I would just say, really, the path ahead is going to depend on the way the economy evolves."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"We didn’t, of course, do an SEP at this meeting."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,We will do another one at the September meeting.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"I would just say, I can—I can imagine a scenario in which there would be everywhere from zero cuts to several cuts, depending on the way the economy evolves, and I wouldn’t want to lay out a baseline path for you there today."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"I’ve said what I—what I can say about September and about today, though."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Nick.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I can’t really give you any, any better forward guidance on it than that."

2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,HOWARD SCHNEIDER.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"So if we were to see, for example, inflation moving down quickly or more or less in line with expectations, growth remains, let’s say, reasonably strong, and the labor market remains, you know, consistent with its current condition, then I would think that a, a rate cut could be on the table at the September meeting."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"If, if inflation were to prove, you know, sticky and we were to see higher readings from inflation, disappointing readings, we would weigh that along with the other things."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, I think it’s going to be not just any one thing."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s going to be the inflation data, it’s going to be the employment data, it’s going to be the balance of risks as we see it—it’s going to be the totality of all of that that would help us make this decision."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,HOWARD SCHNEIDER.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"And just to follow up on that—specifically, in what ways right now, given all you’ve seen over the last few months, in particular on shelter, on services, et cetera, in what ways are you not confident right now that inflation is on the way back to 2 percent?"
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"We have seen—the last couple of readings have, have certainly added to confidence."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we’ve seen progress across all three categories of core PCE inflation—that’s goods, nonhousing services, and housing services."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"So it’s really just—you know, we had a quarter of poor inflation data at the beginning of the year."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Then we saw some more good inflation data; we had seven months at the end of last year.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, we just want to see more and, and gain confidence."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, as I said, we have—we did gain confidence, and more good data would cause us to, to gain more confidence."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"I, I think it’s just a question of seeing more good data."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"Chair Powell, you’ve said before that you wouldn’t wait until inflation got to 2 percent to cut rates because of how inflation has lagged."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"Does that apply for the labor market, too?"
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"Now we’re back, back to a closer to even focus, so we’ll be looking at labor market conditions and asking whether we’re getting what we’re seeing."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, as I said, we’re prepared to respond if we see that it’s—that it’s not what we wanted to see, which was, you know, a gradual normalization of conditions—if we see more than that."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"And it wouldn’t be any one statistic, although, of course, the unemployment rate is generally thought to be, you know, a single—a good single statistic."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"But we’d be looking at wages, we’d be looking at participation, we’d be looking at all the things—surveys, quits, hires, all of those things—to determine the overall status of the labor market."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,But we’re looking at it now.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"I would say, again, I think you’re back to conditions that are close to 2019 conditions, and that was not an inflationary economy—broadly similar labor markets then."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"When we were far away from our inflation mandate, we had to focus on that."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,I think inflation was actually—core inflation was actually running below 2 percent.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I would—I would not like to see a material further cooling in the labor market, and that’s part of what’s behind our thinking."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"The other part, of course, is that we have made real progress on inflation."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we’re—we’ve got growing confidence there that we are not quite there yet, but we’re more confident that we’re on a—that we’re on a sustainable path down to 2 percent."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"So those two things are working together, and we’re factoring those both into our policy."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Chris.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,So we don’t think—I don’t now think of the labor market in its current state as a likely source of significant inflationary pressures.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,So we weigh—we weigh those two things equally under the law.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"The labor market, maximum employment is one, and stable prices is another."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"We have two mandates, as you know."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"If the labor market is back in equilibrium, why is restrictive policy and, potentially, very restrictive policy, given the high real funds rate, warranted right now?"
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,So this is the very reason that we’re thinking about—that we’ve said in our—in our statement that we’re going back to looking at both mandates and that we think the risks are coming back into balance.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"We think what the data broadly show in the labor market is an ongoing, gradual normalization of labor market conditions."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,And that’s what we want to see.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, we’ve seen that over a period of a couple of years and a move, really, from overheated conditions to more normal conditions."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"We are watching the labor market conditions quite closely, and that’s what we’re seeing."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"If we—if we start to see something that looks to be more than that, then we’re well positioned to respond."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"That’s, that’s part of what we’re thinking."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,NICK TIMIRAOS.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"And when you talk about seeing something that’s more than whatever softness or slowdown you expect, in the past you’ve said that stronger growth wouldn’t, wouldn’t override better news on inflation."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,I wonder how that cuts the other way.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"If you’re seeing more softness in the labor market than what you would expect, does that change the calculus on what you’re looking for out of the inflation numbers to recalibrate policy?"
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we have, we have—growth isn’t one of our three."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"I’ll give an example of, of cases in which it would be appropriate to cut and maybe that it wouldn’t be appropriate to cut."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,So I guess I would—I would think about it this way.

2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,We’ve stated that we do not expect it will be appropriate to reduce the target range for the federal funds rate until we have gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2 percent.

2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"Transcript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference July 31, 2024 CHAIR POWELL."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Good afternoon.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,My colleagues and I remain squarely focused on achieving our dual-mandate goals of maximum employment and stable prices for the benefit of the American people.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Our economy has made considerable progress toward both goals over the past two years.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"The labor market has come into better balance, and the unemployment rate remains low."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Inflation has eased substantially from a peak of 7 percent to 2.5 percent.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,We are strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent goal in support of a strong economy that benefits everyone.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"Today, the FOMC decided to leave our policy interest rate unchanged and to continue to reduce our securities holdings."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,We are maintaining our restrictive stance of monetary policy in order to keep demand in line with supply and reduce inflationary pressures.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"We are attentive to risks on both sides of our dual mandate, and I will have more to say about monetary policy after briefly reviewing economic developments."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a solid pace.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"GDP growth moderated to 2.1 percent in the first half of the year, down from 3.1 percent last year."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"Private domestic final purchases, or PDFP—which excludes inventory investment, government spending, and net exports and usually sends a clearer signal of underlying demand— grew at a 2.6 percent pace over that same period, the first half."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Growth of consumer spending has slowed from last year’s robust pace but remains solid.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"The second quarter’s inflation readings have added to our confidence, and more good data would further strengthen that confidence."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,CHRISTOPHER RUGABER.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,We will continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"At the same time, reducing policy restraint too late or too little could unduly weaken economic activity and employment."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Markets pretty much entirely expect a rate cut in September at this stage.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"I wonder if you think that’s a reasonable expectation, and, if so, why not just make the move today?"
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"So on September, let me say this."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"We, we have made no decisions about future meetings, and that includes the September meeting."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks for taking our questions.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,The broad sense of the Committee is that the economy is moving closer to the point at which it will be appropriate to reduce our policy rate.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"The question will be whether the totality of the data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks are consistent with rising confidence on inflation and maintaining a solid labor market."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"If that test is met, a reduction in our policy rate could be on the table as soon as the next meeting in September."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"So you asked, why not today?"
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I would just say, again, that the broad sense of the Committee is that we’re getting closer to the point at which it will be appropriate to reduce our policy rate but that we’re not quite at that point yet."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Howard.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"In that, we will be data dependent but not data point dependent, so it will not be a question of responding specifically to one or two data releases."

2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"In considering any adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"As the economy evolves, monetary policy will adjust in order to best promote our maximum-employment and price-stability goals."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"If the economy remains solid and inflation persists, we can maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate as long as appropriate."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"If the labor market were to weaken unexpectedly or inflation were to fall more quickly than anticipated, we are prepared to respond."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Policy is well positioned to deal with the risks and uncertainties that we face in pursuing both sides of our dual mandate.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,The Fed has been assigned two goals for monetary policy—maximum employment and stable prices.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,We remain committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal and to keeping longer-term inflation expectations well anchored.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Restoring price stability is essential to achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the longer run.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Our success in delivering on these goals matters to all Americans.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"We understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Everything we do is in service to our public mission.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum-employment and price-stability goals.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,I look forward to your questions.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,We know that reducing policy restraint too soon or too much could result in a reversal of the progress we have seen on inflation.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Chris Rugaber at Associated Press.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"So just to, to follow up on that a bit, if inflation behaves as you expect between now and September, would you regard a cut in September as sort of the baseline scenario right now?"
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Why not?
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,I’d like to ask you about the balance of risks as the American people see it.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"At this point, is the risk greater to leave interest rates where they are, given the damage that higher interest rates do to the economy in slowing demand and raising prices?"
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Or is it more important for the American people that you keep rates where they are to bring inflation down?
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"I, I—you know, I think that we’ve been given an assignment by Congress."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"This is how we serve the American people is by achieving maximum employment and price stability, right?"
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Michael McKee from Bloomberg Radio and Television.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"And so in our, you know, quasi-constitutional document, the Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, we look at the two goals, and if one of them is farther away than the other—the two variables, inflation and employment—if one is farther away from its goal than the other, then you, you concentrate on the one that’s farther away."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, for the last couple of years, the best service we could do to the American people was to focus on inflation."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"But as inflation has come down—and I think the upside risks to inflation have decreased as the labor market has cooled off, and now the labor market has softened—you know, probably the inflation, inflation’s probably a little farther from its target than is employment, but I think the downside risks to, to the employment mandate are, are real now."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we have to weigh all that, and if you think about where that takes us is we have a restrictive policy rate."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s clearly restrictive.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s been the rate we’ve had in place for a full year.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"And the time is coming—as other central banks around the world are facing the same question—the time is coming at which it will begin to be appropriate to dial back that level of restrictions, restriction so that we may address both mandates."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,And you take account of the time to reach the goal.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHAEL MCKEE.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Michael McKee.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"And things like the ECI report and, frankly, the softening in the labor market conditions, you know, give you more confidence that the economy’s not overheating."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"It doesn’t look like an overheating economy, and it looks like an economy that’s normalizing."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,RACHEL SIEGEL.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"And if we’re to think about the first couple months of the year, is there any sense now that they were these blips that could have actually allowed for earlier rate cuts as were some of the projections going into 2024?"
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"So the thing about—if what it is is seasonality, and it could just be— it’s very, very hard to, you know, to do appropriate seasonal adjustments."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"If that’s what it is, then that actually implies that, that other months were underreporting too low inflation."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"If you smoothed it out, it’s a zero-sum game."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,And that’s why we look at 12 months.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"We look at 12 months because that takes all of that out, all those effects out."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"Twelve-month now is 2½ percent headline, 2.6 percent core."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,This is so much better than where we were even a year ago.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s a lot better.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"Now, the job is not done."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"I want to stress that, and we’re committed to getting the job—inflation sustainably under 2 percent, but we need to take note of that progress, and we need to weigh the risks to the labor market and the risks to our inflation target now more equally than we did a year ago."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"Well, you have event risk basically, with the jobs report on Friday and another one before you meet again."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"But as I mentioned, our confidence is growing because we’ve been getting good data."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Are you certain that you won’t fall behind the curve and lead to unnecessary unemployment if you wait until September?
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,“Certainty” is not a word that we have in our—in our business.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"And also, you know, the headline number of jobs has come down, so—but you look at the whole thing."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I think you do look at private demand extra carefully, to your point about, about government."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we’ll just be looking at, at all those things."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,EDWARD LAWRENCE.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Just as a follow then—so could the Fed then be behind the curve?
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"Because you said some of the reports—in the last meeting, you said the reports could be noisy or overstated."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’ve seen some, some tendency to have a narrowing base of job creation in some months going back, but then we’ve had some months where, where job creation was broader."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"Was there a discussion of, of—what kind of discussion was there for a cut today, and could the Fed be “behind the curve”?"
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"Yeah, so look, the objective is to balance the two risks, right?"
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s the risk of going too soon and the risk of going too late.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’ve been—you know, we, we had seven months of good inflation data at the end of last year."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,We said we wanted to see more.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"We said—we pointed out that too much of this was coming from goods, and, sure enough, the first quarter wasn’t, wasn’t great—inflation data."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,You mentioned not wanting to see any further cooling in the job market.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"Well, you know, we’ll look at everything."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Could the government jobs—as a sector—hiring mask underlying weakness in the jobs report?
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, you know, we get—we get a lot of data between now and September, and it isn’t going to be one data read or even two."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s going to be the totality of the data, all of the data, and not just—and then how is that affecting the outlook?"
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,And how is it affecting the balance of risks?
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s going to be the assessment that we do.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"Of course, we’ll, we’ll all look carefully at the employment report, but so much other data coming in and so much happening between now and the September meeting, and we’ll, you know, we’ll make a judgment."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Edward.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,EDWARD LAWRENCE.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Edward Lawrence of Fox Business.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"I do want to dig deeper on what Michael and, and what Nick were asking."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"There’s a, a shift in the statement to balance between the focus between inflation and jobs."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"Looking at the job sides, we’ve seen wage data show sort of an abrupt slowing."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,We’ve—we’re hearing on earnings calls from companies like Intel abrupt layoffs.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"In the jobs report from the BLS, government jobs has been a leading creator."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I think, you know, we need to see more to know that we’re—to have more confidence that we’re on, on a good path down to 2 percent."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHAEL MCKEE.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,So I think all of the data points continue to point to kind of the direction we would want to see.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"So that was taken as, you know, there was a decline in job openings."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,That was good.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"Today’s ECI reading was a little softer than expected, so that’s, that’s a good reading."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,It shows that wage increases are still at a strong level but that that level continues to come down to more sustainable levels over time.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Is that sustainable in your view or something that is worrying?
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s exactly the pattern that we want to be seeing.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"Again, we’re closely monitoring to see whether it starts to show signs that it’s more than that."

2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"Mr. Chairman, back in March, you talked about cutting rates as a process, and, in June, you talked about the idea that, well, one rate cut wouldn’t do anything."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I wonder if you can sort of—following up on Colby’s question—talk about, are you weighing the economy right now in terms of its ability to withstand multiple rate cuts?"
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,So I think the data—the data we’ve been seeing in the labor market are broadly consistent with that normalization process.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,So it painted a picture of a very static labor market.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Layoffs remain low.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, just to follow up quickly: [I] wanted to see what you thought of the recent JOLTS report, which did show hiring, gross hiring, has come down even below 2019 levels."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Or would you consider preemptive cuts to prevent if you saw risks of an unexpected cooling?
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"I would say the quality of this is, is higher, and it’s good, but so far, it’s only a quarter."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Is that something you would cut ahead of time for?
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,So I wouldn’t say I wouldn’t want to see any other cooling.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,It would be more of a material difference.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"If we—if we’d be looking at this and if we see something that looks like a more significant downturn, that would be something that we would—we would have the intention of responding to."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, in terms of—I don’t think of it that way."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think of it as, you know, we’re actually in a good place here."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’re balancing these two risks of, you know, go too soon, and you undermine progress on inflation; wait too long or don’t go fast enough, and, and you put at risk the recovery."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,And so we have to balance those two things.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"That’s the nature of having two mandates, and I think we—this is how we balance them."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s a rough balance, but it does feel like, again, the labor market feels like it’s in a place where it’s just a process of ongoing normalization; 4.1 percent unemployment is still historically low."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, we’ll just have to see what the data show us."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,CHRISTOPHER RUGABER.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Talk us through the process that you think—or is it just one rate cut?
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Or are you in the process now of thinking that rates need to be normalized here?
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Chair Powell."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Rachel.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,RACHEL SIEGEL.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Rachel Siegel from the Washington Post.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks for taking our questions.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"On inflation, do the past few months of good reports look like what we saw last year, where you really had a lot of momentum, with a few bumps in between?"
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,Would you characterize that kind of momentum as back on track at this point in the year?
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"Actually, what we’re seeing now is a little better than what we saw last year."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"Last year, as we pointed out late in the year, a whole lot of the progress we saw last year was from goods prices, which were going down at an unsustainable rate, disinflating at an unsustainable rate."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,This is a broader disinflation.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"This has goods prices coming down, but it’s also—we’re also now seeing progress in the other two big categories: nonhousing services and housing services."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, you know, the thing is, we’ve only—you’ve got one quarter of that."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,We had seven months of low inflation; you got one quarter of this.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"In terms of what that looks like, I mean, I think most rate—you would think, in a base case, that policy rates would move down from here, but I don’t want to try to give specific forward guidance about when that might be, the pace at which it might happen, because I think that’s really going to depend on the economy, and that’s highly uncertain."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"The job is not done on inflation, but, nonetheless, we can afford to begin to dial back the restriction in our policy rate."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,And I think we’re just—it’s part of a process.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"We think we don’t need to be 100 percent focused on inflation because of the progress we’ve made: 12-month headline at 2½ [percent], core at 2.6."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, we’re—we— we’ve seen significant movement in the labor market, and, you know, we’re very mindful of this question of, is it just normalization or is it more?"
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"We think it’s just normalization, but we want to be in a position to, to support the labor market."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"At the same time, we’re seeing progress on inflation."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, you know, we actually got to this—we raised rates a year ago at the July meeting."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, it’s way down from where it was."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"And if you look at the situation in the economy a year ago, unemployment—sorry, inflation was over 4 percent."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,It was a completely different economy.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"Now we’ve made a lot of progress, and the labor market—I think unemployment was in the 3s, mid-3s, so it’s a different economy."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I think it’s time, it’s coming to be time, to adjust that so that we support this continued process."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"The thing we’re trying to do is—you know that we have, we’ve had this really significant decline in inflation, and unemployment has remained low."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"And this is a really unusual and historically, historically unusual and such a welcome outcome for the people we serve."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"What we’re thinking about all the time is, how do we keep this going?"
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,And this is—this is part of that.
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,"Yeah, I can’t really say that, honestly."
2024-07-31,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, you know, it’s been slower than we expected."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,I think we now understand that it’s going to take some time for those lower market rents to get into this.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"So housing inflation is the—is the one piece that is kind of dragging a bit, if I can say."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, you know, the direction of travel is clear, and as long as market rents remain, you know, relatively low inflation, over time that will show up, just the time it’s taking now, several years rather than just one or two cycles of annual lease renewals."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"We know that market rents are doing what we would want them to do, which is to be moving up at relatively low levels, but they’re not rolling over—the leases that are rolling over are not coming down as much and OER is coming in high."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"So that’s—I think we understand that now, but I don’t think the outcome is in doubt again."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,So I would say it’s—the rest of the portfolio—or of the elements that go into core PCE inflation have behaved pretty well.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, they’re all—they all have some volatility."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"We will get down to 2 percent inflation, I believe, and I believe that, ultimately, we’ll get what we need to get out of the housing services piece, too."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,CATARINA SARAIVA.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Some of your colleagues have expressed concern that, with starting to cut rates, you could re-ignite demand in housing and see prices go up even more."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"What’s the likelihood of that, and how would you react to that?"
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Yeah.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"As long as market rents remain under control, the outcome is not as in doubt."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, do you think you can return to 2 percent with housing inflation where it is?"
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Catarina Saraiva with Bloomberg News.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’re, we’re going to move those down over time to a more normal level over time."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"The housing market, it’s hard to—it’s a game that—the housing market is in part frozen because of lock-in with low rates."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,JO LING KENT.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Just have a follow-up to that.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Listening to you talk about inflation moving meaningfully down to 2 percent, is the Federal Reserve effectively declaring a decisive victory over inflation and rising prices?"
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"No, we’re not."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"So inflation, you know—what we say is we want inflation—the goal is to have inflation move down to 2 percent on a sustainable basis."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, we’re not really—we’re close, but we’re not really at 2 percent."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I think we’re going to want to see it be, you know, around 2 percent and close to 2 percent for some time, but we’re certainly not doing—we’re not saying “mission accomplished” or anything like that."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"But I have to say, though, we’re encouraged by the progress that we have made."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Catarina.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,CATARINA SARAIVA.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Hi.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,I just would love to know kind of how the Committee is thinking about the persistence we’ve seen in housing inflation.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,People don’t want to sell their homes.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"So this decision we made today had broad support on the Committee, and I’ve discussed the path ahead."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"As rates come down, people will start to move more, and that’s probably beginning to happen already."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,You have an economy that is growing at a solid pace.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"If you look at forecasters or talk to companies, they’ll say that they think 2025 should be a good year, too."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"So there’s no sense—the U.S. economy is basically fine if you talk to market participants, I mean, you know, business people who are actually out there doing business."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I think, you know, I think our move is timely."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,I do.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, as I said, you can—you can see our, our 50 basis point move as a commitment to make sure that we don’t fall behind."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"So you’re really asking about—your second question, you’re asking about July."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I guess if you ask if we’d gotten the July report before the meeting, would we have cut?"
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,We might well have.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"We didn’t make that decision, but we might well have."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think that’s not—you know, that doesn’t really answer the question that we ask ourselves, which is, let’s look, you know—at this meeting we’re looking back to the July employment report, the August employment report, the two CPI reports, one of which came, of course, during blackout, and all of the other things that I mentioned."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’re looking at all of those things, and we’re asking ourselves, what’s the right—what’s the policy stance we need to move to?"
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"We knew—it’s clear that we—clearly, literally, everyone on the Committee agreed that it’s time to move."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s just how big—how fast do you go, and what do you think about the paths forward."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we’ll do that by returning rates from their high level, which has really been—the purpose of which has been to get inflation under control."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"So you’re right about lags, but I would just point to the overall economy."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, because they have a very low mortgage, it would be quite expensive to refinance."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Just following up on some of the labor market talk earlier, you know, monetary policy operates with long and variable lags, and I’m wondering how much you see being able to keep the unemployment rate from raising too much comes from the fact that you’re starting to act now and that’s going to give people more room to run versus just the labor market is strong."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"But remember, when that happens, you’ve got a seller, but you’ve also got a new buyer in many cases."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"So it’s not, you know, obvious how much additional demand that would make."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mean, the real issue with housing is that we have had, and are on track to continue to have, not enough housing."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,And so it’s going to be challenging.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s hard to find—to zone lots that are in places where people want to live.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s—all of the aspects of housing are more and more difficult, and, you know, where are we going to get the supply?"
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"And this is not something that the Fed can, can really fix."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"But I think, as we normalize rates, you’ll see the housing market normalize."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, I mean, ultimately by getting inflation broadly down and getting those rates normalized and getting the housing cycle normalized, that’s the best thing we can do for house holders."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,And then the supply question will have to be dealt with by the market and also by government.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Victoria.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,VICTORIA GUIDA.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Hi.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Victoria Guida with Politico.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"And then, also, if I could, following up on Nick’s question, do you see today’s 50 basis point move as partially a response to the fact that you didn’t cut in July and that sort of gets you to the same place?"
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,So our intention is really to maintain the strength that we currently see in the U.S. economy.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think we get a—we might, actually— we get two—we get a second jobs report on the day of the meeting, I think, or no, no, on the Friday before the meeting."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"I would just say that, you know, the U.S. economy is in a good place, and, and our decision today is designed to keep it there."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, on the job creation, it depends on—it depends on the inflows, right?"
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, if you’re having millions of people come into the labor force then, and you’re creating 100,000 jobs, you’re going to see unemployment go up."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,So it really depends on what’s the trend underlying the volatility of people coming into the country.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"We understand there’s been quite an influx across the borders, and that has actually been one of the things that’s, that’s, that’s allowed the unemployment rate to rise."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"And the other thing is just the slower hiring rate, which is something we also watch carefully."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,So it does depend on what’s happening on the supply side.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"On the Beveridge curve question, yes, so we all felt, on the Committee, not all, but I think everyone on the Committee felt that job openings were so elevated that they could fall a long way before you hit the part of the curve where job openings turned into higher unemployment, job loss."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"And yes, I mean, I think we are—it’s hard to know that—you can’t know these things with great precision, but certainly it appears that we’re very close to that point, if not at it, so that further declines in job openings will translate more directly into unemployment."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,But it’s been— it’s been a great ride down.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mean, we’ve seen a lot of, of tightness come out of the labor market in that form without it resulting in lower employment."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Edward.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,EDWARD LAWRENCE.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thanks, Chair Powell."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Do you think that trend has further to run, or do you see risk that further labor market cooling will have to come through job losses?"
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Edward Lawrence with Fox Business.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"And relatedly, you know, one of the welcome trends of the last couple of years has been labor markets seen coming out through job openings falling, rather than job losses."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’ve only been running a little above 100,000 jobs a month on payroll the last three months."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Elizabeth.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,We’ll see another labor report.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,We’ll see another jobs report.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,So—and inflation data.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,We’ll get all this data.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,We’ll be watching.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, it’s always a question of, look at the incoming data and ask what are the implications of that data for the evolving outlook and the balance of risks and then go through our process and think, what’s the right thing to do?"
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Is policy where we want it to be to foster the achievement of our goals over time?
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"So that’s what it is, and that’s what we’ll be doing."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Neil.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,NEIL IRWIN.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Chair Powell."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Neil Irwin with Axios.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Do you view that level of job creation as worrying or alarming, or would you be—would you be content if we were to kind of stick at that level?"
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we’ve heard some speculation that you may be going with the federal funds rate to 3½, maybe under 4 percent."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"There’s basically an entire generation that has experienced zero or near- zero federal funds rate, and some think we’re heading in that direction again."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,What’s the likelihood that cheap money is now the norm?
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Nothing else is discussed, and I would also point out that the things that we do really affect economic conditions for the most part with a lag."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, nonetheless, this is what we do."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Our job is to support the economy on behalf of the American people.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, if we get it right, this will benefit the American people significantly."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"So this really concentrates the mind, and, you know, it’s something we all take very, very seriously."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,We don’t put up any other filters.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think if you start doing that, I don’t know where you stop."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,And so we just don’t do that.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Jo Ling.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,JO LING KENT.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you, Chair Powell."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,I’m Jo Ling Kent with CBS News.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"My first question is, very simply, what message are you trying to send American consumers, the American people, with this unusually large rate cut?"
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s never about anything else.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,And it’s—that’s always what it is.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we do that, and we make a decision as a group, and then we announce it."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’re always—we’re always going into this meeting, in particular, and asking, what’s the right thing to do for the people we serve?"
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,So this is a question—and you mean after we get through all of this?
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s just—great question that we just, we can only speculate about."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Intuitively, most—many, many people anyway, would say we’re probably not going back to that era where there were trillions of dollars of sovereign bonds trading at negative rates—long-term bonds trading at negative rates."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"And it looked like the neutral rate was—might even be negative, so—and it was—people were issuing debt at negative rates."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,It seems that’s so far away now.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,My own sense is that we’re not going back to that.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"More specifically, the economy is growing at a solid pace, inflation is coming down closer to our 2 percent objective over time, and the labor market is still in solid shape."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, you know, honestly, we’re going to find out."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,How high is it?
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,I don’t—I just don’t think we know.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s—again, we only know it by its works."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,EDWARD LAWRENCE.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"And one more, how do you respond to the criticism that will likely come that a deeper rate cut now, before the election, has some political motivations?"
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Yeah, so, you know, this is my fourth presidential election at the Fed, and, you know, it’s always the same."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, you know, it feels—it feels to me that the neutral rate is probably significantly higher than it was back then."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,ELIZABETH SCHULZE.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,I don’t see that.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Elizabeth Schulze with ABC News.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,We’ll give you the second question.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"So the answer to your question is that, yes, those, those changes were negotiated between the agencies with my support and with my involvement, with the idea that we were going to re-propose, re-propose the changes that Vice Chair Barr talked about and then take comment on them."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, yes, that is—that’s happening with my support."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,KYLE CAMPBELL.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Is there a date for that— CHAIR POWELL.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"That’s not a final proposal, though, you understand."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,We’re putting them out for comment.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,We’re going to take comment and make appropriate changes.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"We don’t have a—we don’t have a calendar date for that, and, as for the other agencies, you know, the idea is that we’re all moving together, we’re not moving separately, so that—I don’t know exactly where that is."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"But the idea is that we will move as a group to put this, again, out for comment, and then, you know, it’ll—the comments will come back 60 days later, and we’ll dive into them, and we’ll try to bring this to a conclusion sometime in the first half of next year."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,KYLE CAMPBELL.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Right.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"And then, yesterday."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,there were merger reform finalizations from the other bank regulators.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,What does the Fed have to do to align itself on a merger?
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Sure.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,KYLE CAMPBELL.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"And so we’re, we’re not—we do our work to serve all Americans."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’re not serving any politician, any political figure, any cause, any issue, nothing."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s just maximum employment and price stability on behalf of all Americans.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"And that’s how the other central banks are set up, too."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s a good institutional arrangement, which has been good for the public and I hope—and I hope and strongly believe that it will continue."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Kyle.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,KYLE CAMPBELL.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Kyle Campbell for American Banker.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thanks for taking the questions, Chair Powell."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,A couple regulatory developments in the past week that I want to ask you about.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"First, last week Vice Chair for Supervision Michael Barr outlined his views for the changes to the Basel III endgame."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"I’m wondering if you are in alignment with him on what those changes should be, if those have support on the Board in the broad way that you’re looking for, and if you think the other agencies are also fully onboard with that approach."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"And then yesterday, other banking regulators— CHAIR POWELL."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know what, hold the second question."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Okay.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"So that’s the idea, is that— you know, I think the data are clear that countries that have independent central banks, they get lower inflation."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, I would—I would bounce that question to Vice Chair Barr."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,So we did that.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,The sense of the change in the stance is that we’re recalibrating our policy over time to a stance that will be more neutral.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,And today was—I think we made a good strong start on that.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think it was the right decision, and I think it should send a signal that we, you know, that we’re committed to coming up with a good outcome here."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,JENNIFER SCHONBERGER.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Is the economy more vulnerable to a shock now that could tip it into recession?
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,I don’t think so.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"I don’t—there’s—as I look—well, let me look at it this way: I don’t see anything in the economy right now that suggests that the likelihood of a recession—sorry, of a downturn is elevated, okay?"
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Don’t look for anything else.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"You see—you see growth at a solid rate, you see inflation coming down, and you see a labor market that’s, that’s still at very solid levels."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, so I don’t really see that, no."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"So what that tells you is, it’s time to change our stance."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s a good question, but I don’t have that today."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"You now have a cooler labor market, in part because of our activity."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we did for a while, and we kept at that, that the stance that we put in place 14 months ago was a stance that was focused on bringing down inflation."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Jennifer, for the last question."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,JENNIFER SCHONBERGER.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you, Chair Powell."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Jennifer Schonberger with Yahoo Finance.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"You said earlier that the decision today reflects with appropriate recalibration strength in the labor market that could be maintained in the context of moderate growth, even though the policy statement says you view the risks to inflation and job growth as roughly balanced."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Given what you’ve said, though, today, I’m curious, are you more worried about the job market and growth than inflation?"
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Are they not roughly balanced?
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"No, I think—I think, and we think, they are now roughly balanced."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"So if you go back for a long time, the risks were on inflation."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"We had a historically tight labor market, historically tight."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"There was a severe labor shortage, so very hot labor market."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,And we had inflation way above target.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, you know, that said to us, concentrate on inflation, concentrate on inflation."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Part of bringing down inflation, though, is cooling off the economy and a little bit cooling off the labor market."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,And the reason is that people have found over time that insulating the central bank from direct control by political authorities avoids making monetary policy in a way that favors maybe people who are in office as opposed to people who are not in office.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"So countries that are—democracies around the world, countries that are sort of like the United States, all have what are called independent central banks."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Sure.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"And a good definition of price stability is that people in their daily decisions, they’re not thinking about inflation anymore."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"That’s where everyone wants to be, is back to what’s inflation, you know?"
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Just keep it low, keep it stable."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,We’re restoring that.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,So what we’re going through now really restores—it will benefit people over a long period of time.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Price stability benefits everybody over a long period of time, just by virtue of the fact that they don’t have to deal with inflation."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"So that’s what’s been going on, and I think we’ve made real progress."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"I completely—we don’t tell people how to think about the economy, of course."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, of course, people are [still] experiencing high prices, as opposed to high inflation."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,And we understand that’s painful.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Greg.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,GREG ROBB.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Chair Powell."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Greg Robb from Marketwatch.com.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s not something that people experience as pleasant, but, at the end, what you get is low inflation restored, price stability restored."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"I was wondering if you could go through—you said just at the beginning that, coming into the blackout, there was like an open thought of 25 or 50—you know, the Fed could move either 25 or 50."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Many other countries around the world had a similar burst of inflation, and, when that happens, part of the answer is that we raise interest rates in order to cool the economy off in order to reduce inflationary pressures."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Mortgage rates have already been dropping in anticipation of this announcement.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,How much more should borrowers expect those rates to drop over the next year?
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Very hard for me to say.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"That’s—from our standpoint, I can’t really speak to mortgage rates."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,I will say that’ll depend on how the economy evolves.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Our intention, though, is—we think that our policy was appropriately restrictive."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"We think that it’s time to begin the process of recalibrating it to a level that’s more neutral, rather than restrictive."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"We expect that process to take some time, as you can see in the projections that we released today."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"And as—if things work out according to that forecast, other rates in the economy will come down as well."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"However, the rate at which those things happen will really depend on how the economy performs."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,We can’t see—we can’t look a year ahead and know what the economy is to be doing—going to be doing.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,ELIZABETH SCHULZE.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,What’s your message to households who are frustrated that home prices have still stayed so high as rates have been high?
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,What do you say to those households?
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Well, what I can say to the public is that we had the highest—we had a burst of inflation."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"I would sort of argue that when we had those two last speeches by Governor Waller and New York Fed President John Williams, that they were sort of saying that maybe a gradual approach was going to win the day."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mean, I sort of want to ask a seven-part question about this."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, I mean, could you talk— would you have cut rates by 50 basis points if the market had been pricing in, like, low odds of a 50 point move like they were last Wednesday, you know, after the CPI number came out?"
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,There isn’t a bright line.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, it will be—the unemployment rate’s very important, of course, but there isn’t a single statistic or single bright line over which that thing that might move that would dictate one thing or another."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’ll look at—each meeting, we’ll look at all the data on inflation, economic activity, and the labor market, and we’ll make decisions about, is our policy stance where it needs to be to foster over the medium term our mandate goals?"
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,So I can’t—I can’t say we have a bright line in mind.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Matt Egan.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,MATT EGAN.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thanks, Chair Powell."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Matt Egan from CNN.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,I know that you discussed earlier how the Fed does whatever the right thing is and nothing else factors in.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, in general, can you talk about whether or not you believe a sitting U.S. president should have a say in Fed decisions on interest rates?"
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Because that’s something that former President Trump, who obviously appointed you, has previously suggested."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I know the Fed is designed to be independent, but why?"
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Can you tell the public why you view that as so important?
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mean, we’ll certainly look at those, but we will mentally tend to adjust them based on the QCEW adjustment, which you referred to."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,We’re not discarding those.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we will continue to look at that broad array of labor market data, including the payroll numbers."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,It was a really small probability of a 50 point cut.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Does that play in your consideration at all?
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Just talk a little bit about that.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,We’re always going to try to do what we think is the right thing for the economy at that time.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s what we’ll do.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you, Chair Powell."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,And that’s what we did today.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Simon.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,SIMON RABINOVITCH.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you, Chair Powell."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Simon Rabinovitch with the Economist.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"You’ve mentioned how closely you’re watching the labor market, but you also noted that payroll numbers have been a little bit less reliable lately because of the big downward revisions."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Does that put your focus overwhelmingly on the unemployment rate?
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"And given the SEP projection of 4.4 [percent] basically being the peak in the cycle, would going above that be the kind of thing that would trigger another 50 basis point cut?"
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, more data, the usual."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s not as high as it was.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,And what do you expect to learn between now and November that will help inform the scale of the cut at the next meeting?
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,There’s nothing in the—in the SEP that suggests the Committee is in a rush to get this done.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"This, this process evolves over time."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Of course, that’s a projection."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s a baseline projection.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"We know, as I mentioned in my remarks, that the actual things that we do will depend on the way the economy evolves."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,We can go quicker if that’s appropriate.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,We can go slower if that’s appropriate.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,We can pause if that’s appropriate.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"But that’s, that’s what we are contemplating."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Again, I would point you to the SEP as just an assessment of where—what the Committee is thinking today—what the individual members, rather, of the Committee are thinking today, assuming that their particular forecasts take—you know, are realized."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Let’s go to Chris.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,CHRIS RUGABER.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Hi.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Chris Rugaber at Associated Press.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,And that process will take place over time.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"If you look at the SEP, you’ll, you’ll see that it’s, it’s a process of recalibrating our policy stance away from where we had it a year ago, when inflation was high and unemployment low, to a place that’s more appropriate given where we are now and where we expect to be."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,So a couple things.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’ve had the two employment reports, July and August."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’ve also had two inflation reports, including one that came in during blackout."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"We had the QCEW report, which suggests that maybe—that not maybe, but suggests that the payroll report numbers that we’re getting may be artificially high and will be revised down."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,You know that.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’ve also seen anecdotal data, like [the data collected in] the Beige Book."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we took all of those, and we went into blackout."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we thought about what to do, and we concluded that this was the right thing for the economy, for the people that we serve, and that’s, that’s how we made our decision."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,So that’s one question.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,What was the second and third?
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,STEVE LIESMAN.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"How do we make the—sorry, thank you, sir."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"How do we figure out in the months ahead, is there another 25 or 50 coming in based on what should we make that call?"
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Sure.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"A good place to start is the—is the SEP, but let me start with what I said, which was that we’re going to be making decisions meeting by meeting based on the incoming data, the evolving outlook, the balance of risks."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, since the last meeting—okay, the last meeting we have had a lot of data come in."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,The projections show that the Fed—Fed officials expect the fed funds rate to still be above their estimate of long-run neutral by the end of next year.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Does that threaten the weakening of the job market that you said you’d like to avoid?
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Howard Schneider with Reuters.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,How close was this in terms of the decision?
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"You do have the first dissent by a Governor since 2005, I think."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Was the weight clearly in favor of a 50, or was this a very close decision?"
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,I think we had a good—a good discussion.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, if you go back, I talked about this at Jackson Hole, but I didn’t address the question of the size of the cut and left it open, and I think we left it open going into blackout."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"And so there was a lot of discussion back and forth, good diversity of—excellent discussion today."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,I think there was also broad support for the decision that the Committee voted on.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I would add, though, look at the SEP. All 19 of the participants wrote down multiple cuts this year."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,All 19.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"That’s a big change from June, right?"
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Seven of the—seven of them wrote down three or more and—sorry, 17 of the 19 wrote down three or more cuts, and 10 of the 19 wrote down four or more cuts."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, you know, there is a dissent, and there’s a range of views, but there’s actually a lot of common ground as well."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,HOWARD SCHNEIDER.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,HOWARD SCHNEIDER.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,So does that suggest that you see rates as restrictive for that entire period?
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Howard.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,What you have is our individual—accumulation of individual estimates of what that will be in the base case.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Or does it suggest that maybe people see the short-run neutral as a little bit higher?
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think it would—the way I would really characterize it is this: I think people write down their estimate, individuals do."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think every single person on the Committee, if you asked them, what’s your level of certainty around that, they would say there’s a wide range where that could fall."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,So I think we don’t know.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,There are model-based approaches and empirically based approaches that estimate what the neutral rate will be at any given time.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, realistically, we know it by its works."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"So that leaves us in a place where we’ll be—where we expect, in the base case, to be continuing to remove restriction, and we’ll be looking at the way the economy reacts to that."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"And that’ll be guiding us in our thinking about the question that we’re asking at every meeting, which is, is our policy stance the appropriate one?"
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"We know—if you go back, we know that the policy stance we adopted in July of 2023 came at a time when unemployment was 3½ percent and inflation was 4.2 percent."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Today, unemployment is up to 4.2 percent; inflation’s down to a few tenths above 2."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,So we know that it is time to recalibrate our policy to something that is more appropriate given the progress on inflation and on employment moving to a more sustainable level.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,So the balance of risks are now even.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"And this is the beginning of that process I mentioned, the direction of which is toward a sense of neutral, and we’ll move as fast or as slow as we think is appropriate in real time."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,[Laughter] Let me jump in.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, okay, a lot of questions in there."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,The unemployment rate has moved up but remains low at 4.2 percent.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Nominal wage growth has eased over the past year, and the jobs-to-workers gap has narrowed."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Overall, a broad set of indicators suggests that conditions in the labor market are now less tight than just before the pandemic in 2019."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,The labor market is not a source of elevated inflationary pressures.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"The median projection for the unemployment rate in the SEP is 4.4 percent at the end of this year, four-tenths higher than projected in June."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Inflation has eased notably over the past two years but remains above our longer-run goal of 2 percent.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Estimates based on the consumer price index and other data indicate that total PCE prices rose 2.2 percent over the 12 months ending in August and that, excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 2.7 percent."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Longer-term inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters as well as measures from financial markets."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"The median projection in the SEP for total PCE inflation is 2.3 percent this year and 2.1 percent next year, somewhat lower than projected in June."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thereafter, the median projection is 2 percent."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Our monetary policy actions are guided by our dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"For much of the past three years, inflation ran well above our 2 percent goal, and labor market conditions were extremely tight."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Our primary focus had been on bringing down inflation, and appropriately so."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"We are acutely aware that high inflation imposes significant hardship, as it erodes purchasing power, especially for those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Our restrictive monetary policy has helped restore the balance between aggregate supply and demand, easing inflationary pressures and ensuring that inflation expectations remain well anchored."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Our patient approach over the past year has paid dividends: Inflation is now much closer to our objective, and we have gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2 percent."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"In the labor market, conditions have continued to cool."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Improving supply conditions have supported resilient demand and the strong performance of the U.S. economy over the past year.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Transcript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference September 18, 2024 CHAIR POWELL."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Good afternoon.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,My colleagues and I remain squarely focused on achieving our dual-mandate goals of maximum employment and stable prices for the benefit of the American people.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Our economy is strong overall and has made significant progress toward our goals over the past two years.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,The labor market has cooled from its formerly overheated state.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Inflation has eased substantially from a peak of 7 percent to an estimated 2.2 percent as of August.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,We’re committed to maintaining our economy’s strength by supporting maximum employment and returning inflation to our 2 percent goal.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Today, the Federal Open Market Committee decided to reduce the degree of policy restraint by lowering our policy interest rate by ½ percentage point."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"This decision reflects our growing confidence that with an appropriate recalibration of our policy stance, strength in the labor market can be maintained in a context of moderate growth and inflation moving sustainably down to 2 percent."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,We also decided to continue to reduce our securities holdings.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,I will have more to say about monetary policy after briefly reviewing economic developments.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a solid pace.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"GDP rose at an annual rate of 2.2 percent in the first half of the year, and available data point to a roughly similar pace of growth this quarter."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Growth of consumer spending has remained resilient, and investment in equipment and intangibles has picked up from its anemic pace last year."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"In the housing sector, investment fell back in the second quarter after rising strongly in the first."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"In our Summary of Economic Projections, Committee participants generally expect GDP growth to remain solid, with a median projection of 2 percent over the next few years."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"As inflation has declined and the labor market has cooled, the upside risks to inflation have diminished, and the downside risks to employment have increased."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"We now see the risks to achieving our employment and inflation goals as roughly in balance, and we are attentive to the risks to both sides of our dual mandate."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"In light of the progress on inflation and the balance of risks, at today’s meeting, the Committee decided to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by ½ percentage point to 4¾ percent to 5 percent."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,I look forward to your questions.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Steve.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,STEVE LIESMAN.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Steve Liesman, CNBC."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for taking our questions."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"In July, you said you weren’t necessarily thinking about a 50."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"You didn’t want to be specific, but you said you weren’t thinking about a 50."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,The inflation data last week came out a little firmer than expected.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Retail was strong, third-quarter GDP running 3 percent."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"So what changed that made the Committee go 50, and how do you respond to the concerns that perhaps it shows the Fed is more concerned about the labor market?"
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I guess, should we expect more 50s in the months ahead?"
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,And based on what should we make that call?
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum- employment and price-stability goals.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Everything we do is in service to our public mission.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"We understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Our success in delivering on these goals matters to all Americans.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,This recalibration of our policy stance will help maintain the strength of the economy and the labor market and will continue to enable further progress on inflation as we begin the process of moving toward a more neutral stance.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,We are not on any preset course.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,We will continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,We know that reducing policy restraint too quickly could hinder progress on inflation.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"At the same time, reducing restraint too slowly could unduly weaken economic activity and employment."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"In considering additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"In our SEP, FOMC participants wrote down their individual assessments of an appropriate path for the federal funds rate, based on what each participant judges to be the most likely scenario going forward."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Follow-up to that.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"If the economy evolves as expected, the median participant projects that the appropriate level of the federal funds rate will be 4.4 percent at the end of this year and 3.4 percent at the end of 2025."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"These projections, however, are not a Committee plan or decision."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"As the economy evolves, monetary policy will adjust in order to best promote our maximum-employment and price-stability goals."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"If the economy remains solid and inflation persists, we can dial back policy restraint more slowly."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"If the labor market were to weaken unexpectedly or inflation were to fall more quickly than anticipated, we are prepared to respond."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Policy is well positioned to deal with the risks and uncertainties that we face in pursuing both sides of our dual mandate.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,The Fed has been assigned two goals for monetary policy—maximum employment and stable prices.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"We remain committed to supporting maximum employment, bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal, and keeping longer-term inflation expectations well anchored."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"These median projections are lower than in June, consistent with the projections for lower inflation and higher unemployment, as well as the changed balance of risks."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Now that this is in the books, can you give us some guidance as sort of a follow-up to Steve on the pacing here?"
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Payroll job gains averaged 116,000 per month over the past three months, a notable step-down from the pace seen earlier in the year."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHAEL MCKEE.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Michael McKee with Bloomberg TV and Radio.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"To follow up on that, what would constitute for you and the Committee a deterioration in the labor market?"
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"You’re pricing in, basically by the end of next year, 200 basis points of cuts just to maintain a higher unemployment rate."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Would you be moving to a more preemptive monetary policy style— rather than, as you did with inflation, waiting until the data gave you a signal?"
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’re going to be watching all of the data, right?"
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"So if—as I mentioned in my remarks, if the labor market were to slow unexpectedly, then we have the ability to react to that by, by cutting faster."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’re also going to be looking at our other mandate, though."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"We are more—we have greater confidence now that inflation is moving down to 2 percent, but, at the same time, our plan is that we will be at 2 percent, you know, over time."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"So—and policy, we think, is still restrictive, so that should still be happening."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHAEL MCKEE.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"I’m just curious as to how sensitive you’ll be to the labor market, since you forecast we are going to see higher unemployment and it is going to take a significant amount of monetary easing to just maintain it."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, you know, what I would say is, we don’t think we need to see further loosening in labor market conditions to get inflation down to 2 percent."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Michael McKee.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"But we have a dual mandate, and I think you can take this whole action as—take a step back, what have we been trying to achieve?"
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"We have, in fact, begun the cutting cycle now, and we’ll be watching—and that’ll be one of the factors that we consider."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Clearly, clearly payroll job creation has moved down over the last few months, and this bears watching."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Many— By many other measures, the labor market has returned to or below 2019 levels, which was a very good, strong labor market, but this is more sort of 2018, ’17."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"So the labor market bears close—bears close watching, and we’ll be giving it that."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"But ultimately, we think—we believe, with an appropriate recalibration of our policy, that we can continue to see the economy growing, and that will support the labor market."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"In the meantime, if you look at the growth in economic activity data, retail sales data that we just got, second-quarter GDP—all of this indicates an economy that is still growing at a solid pace."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,So that should also support the labor market over time.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"So—but again, we’re—it bears watching."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,And we’re watching.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,COLBY SMITH.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"And just on the point about starting to see rising layoffs, if that were to happen, wouldn’t the Committee already be too late in terms of avoiding a recession?"
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we’re—that’s—you know, our plan, of course, has been to begin to recalibrate and we’re—as you know, we’re not seeing rising claims, we’re not seeing rising layoffs, we’re not seeing that, and we’re not hearing that from companies that that’s something that’s getting ready to happen."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we’re not waiting for that, because, you know, there is—there is thinking that the time to support the labor market is when—is when it’s strong and not when we begin to see the layoffs."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,There’s some lore on that.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,So that’s the situation we’re in.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Of course, we’re going to look at the totality of the data as we make these decisions meeting by meeting."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,So what’s driving it?
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,We’re trying to achieve a situation where we restore price stability without the kind of painful increase in unemployment that has come sometimes with disinflation.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,And I think you can take today’s action as a sign of our strong commitment to achieve that goal.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s a good thing.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Wages are still a bit above what would be their—wage increases, rather, are still just a bit above where they would be over the very longer term to be consistent with 2 percent inflation, but they’re very much coming down to what that sustainable level is."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,So we feel good about that.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Vacancies over—per unemployed is back to what is still a very strong level.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"That number reached two to one, two vacancies for every unemployed person."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"But that’s still—that’s still a very good number, I would say."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, quits have come back down to normal levels."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mean, I could go on and on."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"There are many, many employment indicators."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,What do they say?
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,They say this is still a solid labor market.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"The question isn’t the level; the question is that there has been change, particularly over the last few months, and, you know, so what we say is, as the risks, the upside risks, to inflation have really come down, the downside risks to employment have increased."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, and because we have been patient and held our fire on cutting while, while inflation has come down, I think we’re now in a very good position to manage the risks to both of our goals."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,RACHEL SIEGEL.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Would you expect this to be running every other meeting once we get into next year?
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s, you know—we’ve had—we’re right—adjusted for demographics for aging, participation’s at pretty high levels."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s what we’re trying to do.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Participation is at high levels.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"And anything in the low 4s is, is a really—is a good labor market."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Rachel.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,RACHEL SIEGEL.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Chair Powell."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Rachel Siegel from the Washington Post.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks for taking our questions.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,You’re describing this view that you don’t think you’re behind when it comes to the job market.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Can you walk us through the specific data points that you found to be most helpful in the discussions at this meeting?
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"You’ve mentioned a couple, but would you be able to walk us through what that dashboard told you, as far as what you know about the job market now?"
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Sure.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we’ll start with unemployment, which is the single most important one probably."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,You’re at 4.2 percent.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"That’s, you know—I know it’s higher than we were used to seeing, numbers in the mid- and even below mid-3s last year, but, if you look back over the sweep of the years, that’s, that’s a low."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s a very healthy unemployment rate.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,So that’s one thing.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"So you’re close to mandate, maybe at mandate, on that."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"As measured, it’s now below—it’s around one."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,And what do you see as the risks?
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, again, the labor market is actually in solid condition, and our intention with our policy move today is to keep it there."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,You can say that about the whole economy.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,The U.S. economy is in good shape.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s growing at a solid pace, inflation is coming down, the labor market is in a strong pace, we want to keep it there."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"That’s, that’s what we’re doing."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Sorry—Nick.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,NICK TIMIRAOS.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Chair Powell, does today’s action constitute a catch-up in action given recent substantial revisions to the employment data, or is this larger-than-typical rate cut a function of the elevated nominal level of the policy rate such that an accelerated cadence could be expected to continue?"
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Okay, multiple questions in there."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,So I would say we don’t think we’re behind.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"And so I wonder if you can walk us through why you see the labor market stabilizing, sort of what’s the mechanism there?"
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"We do not think—we think this is timely, but I think you can take this as a sign of our commitment not to get behind."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Obviously, historically, when the unemployment rate climbs that much over a relatively short period of time, it doesn’t typically just stop—it continues increasing."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks for taking our questions.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’re going to take it meeting by meeting, as I mentioned."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I think what we’re seeing is, clearly labor market conditions have cooled off by any measure, as I talked about in Jackson Hole, and—but they’re still at a level— the level of those conditions is actually pretty close to what I would call maximum employment."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,There’s no sense that the Committee feels it’s in a rush to do this.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"We made a good, strong start to this, and that’s really, frankly, a sign of our confidence—confidence that inflation is, is coming down toward 2 percent on a sustainable basis."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,That gives us the ability.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"We can, you know, make a good, strong start."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"To me, the logic of this, both from an economic standpoint and also from a risk-management standpoint, was clear."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"But I think we’re going to go carefully, meeting by meeting, and make our decisions as we go."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,HOWARD SCHNEIDER.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.

2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,JEANNA SMIALEK.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Chair Powell."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Jeanna Smialek, New York Times."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,You and your colleagues in your economic projections today see the unemployment rate climbing to 4.4 percent and staying there.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"So it’s, it’s a strong move."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,But—and I’m very pleased that we did.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,NICK TIMIRAOS.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, in the current situation, reserves have really been stable."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,They haven’t come down.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,So reserves are still abundant and expected to remain so for some time.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"As you know, the shrinkage in our balance sheet has really come out of the overnight RRP [facility]."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I think what that tells you is, we’re not thinking about, about stopping runoff because of this at all."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,We know that these two things can happen side by side.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"In a sense, they’re both a form of normalization, and so, for a time, you can have the balance sheet shrinking but also be cutting rates."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Colby.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,COLBY SMITH.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Colby Smith with the Financial Times.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Just following up on Jeanna’s question on rising unemployment.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I guess, in direct follow-up to Jeanna, do you not—why should we not expect a further deterioration in labor market conditions if policy is still restrictive?"
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Sorry, your other question was?"
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Is it your view that this is just a function of a normalizing labor market amid improved supply, or is there anything to suggest that something more concerning perhaps is taking place here, given that other metrics of labor demand have softened too?"
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"With a larger cut today, is there any—should there be any signal inferred about how the Committee would approach “end state” on the balance sheet policy?"
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,NICK TIMIRAOS.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, if I could follow up on the balance sheet, in 2019, when you did the mid-cycle adjustment, you ceased the balance sheet runoff."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I think it’s about—we come into this with a policy position that was put in place, as you know, I mentioned, in July of 2023, which was a time of high inflation and very low unemployment."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’ve been very patient about, about reducing the policy rate."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,We’ve waited.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Other central banks around the world have cut, many of them several times."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’ve waited, and I think that that patience has really paid dividends in the form of our confidence that inflation is moving sustainably under 2 percent."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I think that is what enables us to take this, this strong move today."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Or is this about the level of the funds rate—the high nominal level of funds rate relative to what might be expected if you’re trying to maintain equilibrium?
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,And we’re moving at the pace that we think is appropriate given developments in the economy and the base case.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Of course, what happens will happen."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"It was, is this about what happened in the employment data between this meeting and the last meeting?"
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, so, in the base case, what you see is—look at the SEP, you see cuts moving along."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,The sense of this is we’re recalibrating policy down over time to a more neutral level.
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"I do not think that anyone should look at this and say, “Oh, this is the new pace.” You know, you have to think about it in terms of the base case."
2024-09-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"The economy can develop in a way that would cause us to go faster or slower, but that’s what the base case is."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,No.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,Mike.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHAEL MCKEE.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,Michael McKee from Bloomberg Radio and Television.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,But I would say this.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"But in terms of forward-looking assessments of the economy, what are you hearing from CEOs or other officials around the country?"
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"What did you hear today from the regional Bank presidents about what companies and consumers think about where the economy is going from here, rather than looking backwards?"
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,And does that match up with what your forecasts have been and what you think the appropriate policy path should be?
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"So it’s hard to characterize a, you know, really interesting set of discussions we had, and, of course, you’ll see them in the minutes in three weeks."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,You talk a lot about what the data are telling you and how you are dependent on the data.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,Hi.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,VICTORIA GUIDA.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, overall, it’s a good labor market."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,We could talk about 20 different data series.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’ll be looking at all of them, of course."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think, you know, the comments from our Reserve Bank colleagues and from the CEOs that they talk to are pretty constructive on the economy right now—pretty constructive, feeling that the labor market is, is, you know, back to normal to the point where it’s no longer that much of a discussion topic in their world, whereas two years ago, it was all they were talking about."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, you know, we don’t want the labor market to, to soften much from here."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,We don’t think we need that to happen to get inflation back to 2 percent.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,Can you follow up on is—do you think that legally that you’re not required to leave?
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,VICTORIA GUIDA.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,Victoria Guida with Politico.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,Some of the President-elect’s advisers have suggested that you should resign.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"If he asked you to leave, would you go?"
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,No.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,Victoria.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,So they feel like the labor market’s in balance.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"Now, that can change through the price of oil or otherwise, but people talk about those as, you know, something that’s on the horizon all the time."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,Demand is obviously pretty strong.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, you know, I have said many times no more, no less than what the predecessors you mentioned have said."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"If you look at the NIPA revisions that came out a month ago, we’re five years into, into a nice set of productivity readings, which are sustained and very healthy."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,Is that something you’d speak out against?
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"We have large budget deficits and debt at historic, historic highs that are—and rising."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, right now, we’re in a period of full employment."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"Will you do that, too?"
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,Your predecessors Greenspan and Volcker spoke up loudly when they thought large budget deficits endangered financial— economic or financial stability.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,I just wanted to follow up on the discussion earlier on fiscal policy.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s Andrew Ackerman with the Washington Post.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,Hi.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,ANDREW ACKERMAN.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,Andrew.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,People feel good about where the economy is.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"If anything, people feel next year—I’ve heard this from several people—that next year could even be stronger than this year."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, you know, ultimately, if you look at the U.S. economy, its, its performance has been very good."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think it’s—you know, it’s things like—clearly, geopolitical risks around the world are elevated, and just as clearly, they’ve had relatively little effect on the U.S. economy."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"To follow up on the areas of caution, if there were black clouds on the horizon that you identified as something you’re watching, what would they be?"
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHAEL MCKEE.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"Now, that’s not to say—there are areas of caution and things like that but, ultimately, overall pretty positive."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, of course, I hear the Reserve Bank presidents do a lot of that, and it’s pretty constructive overall."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"I don’t get to talk to a lot of CEOs in my job, but I hear what others summarize from those."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,And I think that is reflected in what you hear from—what I hear people hear from CEOs.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’re, you know, really performing better than any of our global peers."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s actually remarkable how well the U.S. economy has been performing with, you know, strong growth, a strong labor market, inflation coming down."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"This is—this is—you know, this is a strong economy."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,Maybe the year is 2½.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, you’re seeing, what, 2.8 percent growth in the third quarter estimated."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"And that’s, that’s what we hear from businesspeople, an expectation that that will continue."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, you know, it may be that—we’re now five years."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,CRAIG TORRES.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, of course, you know, the lore on productivity readings is whenever you see high readings, you should assume they’re going to revert pretty quickly to the longer-term trend."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"Again, that’s not meant to have a specific meaning other than we—to the extent—to the extent the economy remains strong, we have the ability to, to take advantage of that as we try to navigate that middle path between the two risks."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"And so we think that the right way—the right way to find neutral, if you will, is carefully, patiently."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"We are seeing ongoing strength in the labor market; we’re watching that carefully, but we do see maintaining strength there."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,We are seeing strong economic activity.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,Nothing in the economic data suggests that the Committee has any need to be in a hurry to get there.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"So you’re quickly trying to get to that neutral rate that you see, or do you foresee that you have some time to get there?"
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,EDWARD LAWRENCE.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"That story is intact, and it won’t be one or two really good data months, or bad data months aren’t going to really change the pattern at this point, now that we’re this far into the process."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"So you’re seeing—we’re not, not declaring victory, obviously, but we feel like the story is very consistent with inflation continuing to come down on a bumpy path over the next couple of years and settling around 2 percent."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,You see that catch-up inflation also in insurance and in several other areas.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,What is the story about inflation?
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s not a very tight economy.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,Where is it coming from?
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"The other thing is, I’d say look at the labor market—not a source of inflationary pressures."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"So that’s, that’s one thing."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s not really reflecting current inflationary pressures; it’s reflecting past inflationary pressures.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,So that’s just a catch-up problem.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"And what’s happening is older, you know, leases that are turning over are taking several years to catch up to where market, market leases are—market rent leases are."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"What’s going on there is, you know, market rents, newly signed leases, are experiencing very low inflation."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,Housing services is higher.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,So let’s talk about housing services.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,What’s not is housing services.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,So they’re back at that level.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"One is the nonhousing services and goods, which together make up 80 percent of that— of the core PCE index, are back to the levels they were at the last time we had sustained 2 percent inflation, which happens to be in the early 2000s for a period of five, six, seven years."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,Where is it coming from?” So I point to a couple of things.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,And what that is is that the U.S. fiscal—federal government’s fiscal path—fiscal policy is on an unsustainable path.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"Overall, you see the progress on inflation, and you also look at the economy, and you say, “What’s—what is the inflation story now?"
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,Craig.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Chair Powell."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,Craig Torres from Bloomberg.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,Two questions today.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I would say—in fact, you can say it the other way, that, that wage increases are now consistent with 2 percent inflation given current productivity readings."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"If we see the—if we see productivity, you know, more sustainably at these high levels, then that would sustain higher wage gains."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"Wages are still running just a bit above where they would need to be to be consistent with 2 percent inflation, unless productivity is going to remain at this high level."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,I would—I would characterize it more broadly as “normalizing.” You mentioned wages.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, the, the openings to unemployment rate is back to a normal level."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, you mentioned a bunch of, of indicators, and you’re right."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"And our policy, of course, is designed to keep it in that good place, to maintain the strength in the labor market, while also enabling further progress on inflation."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"It appears that the—I wouldn’t say that the labor market has fully stabilized, because I do think it’s continuing to very gradually cool, but it seems to be in a good place."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"So far, it doesn’t appear to be."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,Sometimes that has meant bad things.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,So we’ve seen a big change upward in unemployment.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"We also know that it’s come down significantly—sorry, moved up significantly from a year or so ago."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,What we know is that the unemployment rate is low.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, there’s nothing really surprising here."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,That has always been the case for 50 years.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,So I’ll just say a couple things.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"So on your first question, I’m not going to talk about anything that relates directly or indirectly to the election."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,Sure.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,So at what point do we reach what you would describe as a shortfall from maximum employment?
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"It is cooling, generally, a little bit further."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,So you have put a marker at Jackson Hole saying any “further cooling” is unwelcome.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"The quits rate, a signal of labor market dynamism, has been heading down to that bad neighborhood of the 20-teens."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,Compensation gains are sliding back.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,One of the broadest measures of unemployment is up about a half a point from a year ago.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,So the unemployment rate has been at 4 percent or higher for six months.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"Second question—I want to talk about some labor market indicators, and I do so with great respect for your attentiveness to the maximum-employment side of the mandate, Chair Powell."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,First question.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,Did you learn anything about what Americans think about the economy from the election results?
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"On the second one, you’re—you know, this is the great question, and it’s the one we think about all the time."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,The level of our debt relative to the economy is not unsustainable.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we went through—the world went through a global inflation shock, and inflation went up everywhere."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,And we see that.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,Nancy Marshall-Genzer with Marketplace.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Chair Powell."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,Nancy.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"I’m not going—I’m not going to get into the—any of the political things here today, but thank you."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,Any concern about his influence on the Fed’s independence?
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,And just a quick follow-up—President-elect Trump has been critical of your performance.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,KELLY O’GRADY.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"We—you know, we respect them."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,We don’t question them.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,Those feelings are true; they’re accurate.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,We respect—completely respect—what they’re feeling.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, we don’t tell people how to—how to feel about the economy."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"But it’ll be some time before people, you know, regain their confidence and feel that."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"So it’s just—I think—I think what needs to happen is happening and, for the most part, has happened."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"Wages are moving up but, but at a sustainable level."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,The economy is still strong here.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,Inflation has come way down.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,And I think we’re well on the road to creating that.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,And that’s what we’re—that’s what we’re trying to create.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,So what that takes is it takes some years of real wage gains for people to feel better.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, it, it stays with you because the price level doesn’t come back down."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"So you’re right that, you know, we say that the economy is performing well, and it is, but we also know that people are still feeling the effects of high prices, for example."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,So what’s your message to them on when they might expect relief?
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"We just talked about what you’ve heard from business leaders on the economy, but many average Americans are still not feeling the strength of the economy in their wallets."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"Kelly O’Grady, CBS News."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,What is your plan if we start to see stagflation?
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"So that’s a—you know, the whole plan is not to have stagflation, so we don’t have to deal with it."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,So that’s our—that is actually our plan.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,We understand that.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"But that’s not part of our framework, and it’s not something we’re going to be—going to be looking at in our framework review."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, part of the problem there is that low inflation can be a problem, too, in a way."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,We’re—we do not have—we do not think it would be appropriate to deliberately undershoot.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’re aiming for inflation at, at 2 percent."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"That’s, that’s not the way our framework works."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,No.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,Would it be appropriate for the Fed to undershoot for a while on its inflation goal under the average inflation-targeting regime so people have a chance to catch up?
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"I wanted to go back to a comment that you had made about Americans being quite unhappy about the cumulative price level rises over the past few years, even though now inflation is back on a path to 2 percent."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,Jean Yung with MNI Market News.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Chair Powell."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,JEAN YUNG.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,Let’s go to Jean for the last question.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Chair Powell."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"So— but, ultimately, you know, it’s—we’re not in a—we’re not in a world where we can afford to rule, rule things out a full year in advance."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, short of some exogenous event, it will—that will continue to be our forecast for the foreseeable future."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"If you look at our—look at our—that will not change from the September SEP. You know, that is our baseline forecast."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mean, our baseline expectation is that we’ll continue to move gradually down towards neutral, that the economy will continue to grow at a healthy clip, and that the labor market will remain strong."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"But that’s certainly not, not our plan."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,I wouldn’t rule anything out or in that far away.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,I—no.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,Can you rule out an interest rate hike next year?
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we believe we can complete the inflation task while also keeping the labor market strong, and that, of course, is exactly what we’re trying to do."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"So knock on wood, we’ve gotten this far without seeing a real weakening in, in the labor market."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"I would just say that, you know, we’ve, we’ve been able to see inflation come down a whole lot, you know, much closer to our goal without the kind of sharp increase in unemployment that has often accompanied programs of disinflation."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"[Laughter] You know, it’s, of course, a very difficult thing because you’re—you know, you’re—anything you do with interest rates will, will hurt one side or the other, either the inflation mandate or the—or the employment mandate."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s—there’s just too much uncertainty in what we do.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,The path is unsustainable.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,KELLY O’GRADY.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,No.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"Can you lay out what some of those uncertainties are and whether or not it includes some of the proposals that the President-elect has put out on the campaign trail— tariffs, for instance?"
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"In response to Howard’s question, you said it wasn’t an ideal time to give forward guidance because of the economic uncertainties."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,Courtenay Brown from Axios.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Chair Powell."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,COURTENAY BROWN.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,Courtenay.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,ANDREW ACKERMAN.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,Not permitted under the law.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you very much.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,Not what?
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,ANDREW ACKERMAN.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,Not permitted under the law.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"I guess the only other question is—to follow up on Victoria’s question—do you believe the President has the power to fire or demote you, and has the Fed determined the legality of a President demoting at will any of the other Governors with leadership positions?"
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,Okay.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,ANDREW ACKERMAN.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,I’ve said it on many occasions—just said it again.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,We don’t have oversight over fiscal policy.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,I don’t have oversight.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"Now, I can say that."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,It is ultimately a threat to the economy.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"So it’s important that we—you know, that that be dealt with."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, you’ve got a very large deficit at—you’re at full employment, and that’s expected to continue."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"I was not referring to, to the new Administration’s policies at all, nor will I today."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I—what I’m just saying is, as we look ahead, we know—and I mentioned this in my statement—that the risks are two sided."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"I guess I should start by saying that we think that the economy and we think our policy are both in a very good place, a very good place."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"And—but as you look forward, you say, “What are the risks?” And one risk is that we would move too quickly and find ourselves having moved too quickly, and inflation comes back, and we—and we lost our chance to get inflation back to 2 percent."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"But that’s, that’s really why we reacted so sharply back in 2022 was, was to avoid that."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"But you’re right to say we watch that very carefully, and we will not allow inflation expectations to drift upward."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, overall, expectations seem to be—and really have throughout this—in a place that’s consistent with 2 percent inflation."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,So that’s one that’s been a traditional one that we look at a lot.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’re still seeing between surveys and market readings broadly consistent with—you know, I, I looked at the five-year, five-year earlier today, and it’s probably moved, but it’s just not—it’s just—it’s kind of right where it’s been, and also it’s pretty close to consistent with 2 percent PCE inflation."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s not what we’re seeing.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we, we would be concerned if we saw—if we thought we saw longer-term inflation expectations anchoring at a higher level."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"Do you have any concern at all that longer-term inflation expectations are deanchoring or, put another way, are anchoring at a slightly higher level?"
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s up half a point from when you cut in September.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"I know you don’t want to share your decomposition of bond yields, but if you look at the breakevens, it, it is clear that longer-term inflation expectations do seem to have risen up at about 2.5 percent, for example, on the five-year."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,Simon Rabinovitch with the Economist.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you, Chair Powell."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,Kelly.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,SIMON RABINOVITCH.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we’re going to move carefully as, as this goes on so that, you know, we can increase the chances that we will get it right."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"But as we move further, there will be more uncertainty about where that is."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,We’re pretty sure it’s below where we are now.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,We don’t know exactly where that is; we only know it by its works.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, it’s not as important—the precise timing of these things is not as important as the overall arc of them, and the arc of them is to move from where we are now to a sense of neutral, a more neutral policy."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"And so there’s—you know, there— this is the thing: Meeting by meeting, we’re going to be making our assessment of what the right path is."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"Again, the idea is to maintain support, the strength that we have in the labor market and in the economy, but also with somewhat less restrictive but still restrictive policy, enable further progress toward our 2 percent inflation goal."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,We try to be in the middle and deal with both of the—manage both of those.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"And so we’re, we’re in the middle there."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"That, that says, “Don’t get behind the curve.” So these are two—these two things are the two risks that we have to manage."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,The other risk is that we move too slowly and that we allow the labor market to weaken too much and do unnecessary damage to the labor market and to people’s working lives.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"And that, that—to avoid that risk, that means you want to move carefully."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,So we have to avoid that risk.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,Simon.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,So there will literally be a bump up and then down.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, I can’t."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"On the other hand, the January reading certainly looks like an example of residual seasonality, so that we saw last year."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,The NIPA revision was stronger.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, in the main, the economic activity data have been stronger than expected."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, people are—let’s talk about the data we’ve gotten since the last meeting."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"I, I wouldn’t want to comment one way or the other."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s—you get halfway through the cycle between the last set and the next set.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,You know what?
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,Do they still seem relevant given where we are now?
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,If I could follow up—is the September SEP—are those rate projections still valid?
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,NICK TIMIRAOS.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, again, these things don’t really have mainly to do with, with Fed policy, but to do with other factors in the economy."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s just something that we’re watching.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,But I would say we’re not at—we’re not at that stage right now.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"If they—if they’re persistent and if they’re material, then we’ll certainly take them into account in our policy."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, we do take financial conditions into account."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,So that’s what they’re about.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,They’re really about a sense of more likely to have stronger growth and perhaps less in the way of downside risks.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"I will say, though, that it appears that the moves are not, not principally about higher inflation expectations."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"Ultimately, I’m sure we’ve all read these decompositions of what, you know—and I certainly have, but it’s not really our job to provide our specific decomposition."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,I think it’s too early to really say where they settle.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"Things have been moving around, and we’ll see where they settle."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,So we’re watching that.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"I guess that, you know, the long- run rates are well below that level."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’ve watched the, the run-up in bond rates, and it’s, it’s nowhere where it was, of course, a year ago."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,So I would just say this.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"Given that you’ve said you believe policy is restrictive and the Fed is now dialing back that restriction, are the growth risks presented by higher U.S. Treasury yields today any different from those you identified one year ago when inflation was still meaningfully above your target?"
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"Roughly one year ago when the 10-year Treasury was flirting with 5 percent and 30-year mortgage rates were near 8 percent, you noted how higher borrowing costs, if they were sustained, could weigh on economic activity."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"Chair Powell, Nick Timiraos from the Wall Street Journal."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"Certainly, the September employment report was stronger; the October report, not stronger; retail sales, stronger."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,NICK TIMIRAOS.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, overall, though, I think you take away a sense of, of some of the downside risks to economic activity having, having been diminished, with the NIPA revisions in particular, and so, overall, feeling, feeling good about economic activity."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"At the same time, we got one inflation report, which was—it wasn’t terrible, but it was— it was a little higher than expected."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, and that’s very much what we’re on."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mean, I—it’s just—I would put it this way: We’re on a path to a more neutral stance."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"Again, I’m going to wait—we’re going to wait and see how things come in in December."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"I guess when it comes to your own thinking, do you think that that—a full percentage point of rate cuts in 2025—is a reasonable outlook?"
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"Yes, total—totally appreciate that."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,JEANNA SMIALEK.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, again, I can’t really update you on the Committee’s thinking, because we don’t fill out an SEP at this meeting."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"We think that’s where we are, but that’s the question we’re going to be asking in September and, and in other meetings."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’re trying to, to be on a middle path where we can maintain the strength in the labor market while also enabling further progress on inflation."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we’re, we’re asking ourselves, “Is that where we need to be?” You know that we’re, we’re trying to steer between the risk of moving too quickly and perhaps undermining our progress on inflation or moving too slowly and allowing the labor market to weaken too much."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"After today’s move, we’re down 75 basis points."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"As you know, we’re in the process of recalibrating from a fairly restrictive level at 5.33 percent."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"I would just say, for December, we’re going to be—again, in every meeting—we’re going to be looking at the incoming data and how that affects the outlook."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,So I can’t really speak for kind of exactly where the—where the Committee is.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"We don’t fill out a—we don’t fill out an SEP, and I can’t characterize one that wasn’t filled out today."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"And if it shifted at all, can you—can you give a little bit of, of detail as to why?"
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"Is that sort of the baseline outlook at this point, or has that shifted?"
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,Do you still think that those are likely?
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"And then, as of the Fed’s economic projections in September, you, you had written down four quarter-point interest rate cuts in 2025."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"When it comes to December, what will you be looking at specifically as you try to make that decision?"
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thanks for taking our questions, Chair Powell."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,Jeanna Smialek from the New York Times.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,JEANNA SMIALEK.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,Jeanna.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, by December we’ll have—we’ll have more data: I guess one more employment report, two more inflation reports, and lots of other data, and, you know, we’ll make a decision as we get to December."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I think, really, the question is, is December."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,So I think we would factor that in.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,Nick.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, we—along with countless other factors, forecasts of those economic effects would be included in our models of the economy and would be taken into account through that channel."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"Longer-term inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters, as well as measures from financial markets."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"Overall, inflation has moved much closer to our 2 percent longer-run goal, but core inflation remains somewhat elevated."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"Total PCE prices rose 2.1 percent over the 12 months ending in September; excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 2.7 percent."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,Inflation has eased significantly over the past two years.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,The labor market is not a source of significant inflationary pressures.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"Overall, a broad set of indicators suggests that conditions in the labor market are now less tight than just before the pandemic in 2019."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"Nominal wage growth has eased over the past year, and the jobs-to-workers gap has narrowed."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,The unemployment rate is notably higher than it was a year ago but has edged down over the past three months and remains low at 4.1 percent in October.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"Regarding the hurricanes, let me extend our sympathies to all the families, businesses, and communities who have been harm—harmed by these devastating storms."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,This figure would have been somewhat higher were it not for the effects of labor strikes and hurricanes on employment in October.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"Payroll job gains have slowed from earlier in the year, averaging 104,000 per month over the past three months."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"In the labor market, conditions remain solid."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"Overall, improving supply conditions have supported the strong performance of the U.S. economy over the past year."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"In contrast, activity in the housing sector has been weak."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"Growth of consumer spending has remained resilient, and investment in equipment and intangibles has strengthened."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"GDP rose at an annual rate of 2.8 percent in the third quarter, about the same pace as in the second quarter."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a solid pace.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,I’ll have more to say about monetary policy after briefly reviewing economic developments.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,We also decided to continue to reduce our securities holdings.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"We continue to be confident that, with an appropriate recalibration of our policy stance, strength in the economy and the labor market can be maintained, with inflation moving sustainably down to 2 percent."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"Today, the FOMC decided to take another step in reducing the degree of policy restraint by lowering our policy interest rate by ¼ percentage point."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,We are committed to maintaining our economy’s strength by supporting maximum employment and returning inflation to our 2 percent goal.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,Inflation has eased substantially from a peak of 7 percent to 2.1 percent as of September.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,The labor market has cooled from its formerly overheated state and remains solid.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,The economy is strong overall and has made significant progress toward our goals over the past two years.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,My colleagues and I remain squarely focused on achieving our dual-mandate goals of maximum employment and stable prices for the benefit of the American people.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,Good afternoon.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"Transcript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference November 7, 2024 CHAIR POWELL."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"So when that falls out of the 12-month calculation in February, we should see it staying down."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,Our monetary policy actions are guided by our dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"We see the risks to achieving our employment and inflation goals as being roughly in balance, and we’re attentive to the risks to both sides of our mandate."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"At today’s meeting, the Committee decided to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by ¼ percentage point, to 4½ percent to 4¾ percent."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,This further recalibration of our policy stance will help maintain the strength of the economy and the labor market and will continue to enable further progress on inflation as we move toward a more neutral stance over time.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"Now, just in principle, it’s possible that any Administration’s policies or, or policies put in place by Congress could have economic effects over time—over time that would matter for our pursuit of our dual-mandate goals."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"We don’t—we don’t guess, we don’t speculate, and we don’t assume."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"We therefore don’t know what the effects on the economy would be—specifically, whether and to what extent those policies would matter for the achievement of our goal variables: maximum employment and price stability."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"Here, we don’t know what the timing and substance of any policy changes will be."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"So let me say that in the near term, the election will have no effects on our policy decisions."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,Sure.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, and can you give us any more sense of how proactive or reactive the Fed is prepared to be to changes in economic policies with the next Administration?"
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"Given the expectation that the election outcome will produce policies that would meaningfully impact the U.S. economy next year, how is the Committee taking these proposals into account for upcoming decisions, including potentially the next one in December?"
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,COLBY SMITH.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,Colby.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,I look forward to our discussion.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,That has not changed at all since September.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,Everything we do is in service to our public mission.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"We understand that our affect—actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,Our success in delivering on these goals matters to all Americans.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"We remain committed to supporting maximum employment, bringing inflation sustainably to our 2 percent goal, and keeping longer-term inflation expectations well anchored."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,The Fed has been assigned two goals for monetary policy—maximum employment and stable prices.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,Policy is well positioned to deal with the risks and uncertainties that we face in pursuing both sides of our dual mandate.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"If the labor market were to weaken unexpectedly or inflation were to fall more quickly than anticipated, we can move more quickly."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"If the economy remains strong and inflation is not sustainably moving toward 2 percent, we can dial back policy restraint more slowly."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"As the economy evolves, monetary policy will adjust in order to best promote our maximum-employment and price-stability goals."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,We will continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,We are not on any preset course.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"In considering additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"At the same time, reducing policy restraint too slowly could unduly weaken economic activity and employment."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,We know that reducing policy strain—restraint too quickly could hinder progress on inflation.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum-employment and price-stability goals.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, we’re just going to have to see where the—where the data lead us."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"As you know, many, many things affect the economy, and anyone who writes down forecasts in their job will tell you that the economy is quite difficult to forecast, looking out past the very near term."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"Obviously, I’m not ruling it out or in, but, but, you know, I would say—you know, I would say that, you know, again, we didn’t update the SEP, so I’m not going to characterize, you know, where the Committee would be."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"And just to follow up, could you—what might cause you to pause rate cuts in December?"
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,Great.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,CHRISTOPHER RUGABER.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"Overall, as I mentioned, we believe that with an appropriate recalibration of our policy stance, we can maintain strength in the labor market even as our policy stance enables further progress toward our inflation goal."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"But if you look at those two things, we judged in September that it was appropriate to begin to recalibrate our policy stance to reflect this progress, and today’s decision is really another step in that process."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,So the job’s not done on inflation.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"Inflation has moved down a great deal from its higher—its highs of two years ago, and we judged, as I mentioned, that it’s on a sustainable path back to 2 percent."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,So that’s the labor market.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"It is continuing to cool, albeit at a—at a modest rate, and we don’t need further cooling, we don’t think, to achieve our inflation mandate."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"And if you look at our goal variables, the labor market has cooled a great deal from its overheated state of two years ago and is now essentially in balance."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"We understand it’s not possible to say precisely how restrictive, but we feel that it is still restrictive."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, of course, our mandate is maximum for employment and price stability, and we think that even with today’s cut, policy is still restrictive."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"As I mentioned, and as you mentioned, the latest economic data have been strong, and that’s, of course, a great thing and highly welcome."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,So you’re right.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"That’s renewed some of the questions about why, why do many cuts at all in this—with this backdrop?"
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,We saw a stock market jump yesterday.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"You mentioned the positive economic data that we’ve seen since the September meeting, including the revisions to things like savings, higher GDP growth."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,Chris Rugaber at Associated Press.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,CHRISTOPHER RUGABER.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,Chris.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, we’re doing the decompositions and reading others, but right now it’s not a major factor in, in how we’re thinking about things."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,We’re reading.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, we’re watching it."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,What we’ve seen so far?
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,And we don’t know that about these.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, you know, it’s material changes and financial conditions that last, that are persistent, that really matter."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,What kind of economic data would lead you to that path?
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"But we’re—so we’re in the process, as I mentioned, of moving policy down—our stance down over time to a more neutral level."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,So that’s why you see—that’s why forecasts generally see a couple of upticks toward the end of the year.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"We have, you know, a whole six weeks of data to look at to make that decision in December."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"For example, you know, the, the last three months of last year, the core PCE readings were very, very low—probably unsustainably low."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,And we expect there to be bumps.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,But what it’s telling us is that we really have made significant progress.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,And we look at—we also—we look at 12 as well.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,So we look at all of them.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"But if you look at three- and six-month core PCE, you’ll see they’re around 2.3 percent."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,Yes.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,EDWARD LAWRENCE.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we look at all of them, right?"
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,Yes.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"If you remember the 5 percent 10-year, people were drawing massively important conclusions only to find, you know, three weeks later that the 10-year was 50 basis points lower."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,EDWARD LAWRENCE.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,So why doesn’t this data give fuel to a rate pause for this meeting?
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"So with, with this noise in the jobs reports that we’ve seen and you look at the Fed’s favorite inflation, PCE inflation, overall it’s 2.1 percent—very close to the Fed’s target—but core inflation is 2.7 percent, and it’s been that way since July."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thanks, Chair Powell."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,EDWARD LAWRENCE.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,Edward.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"And so, you know, it—we’re thinking about it that way, but it’s, it’s something that we’re just beginning to think about."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we reach a point where we slow the pace, much like an airplane reaching the airport slows down."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,If you— you can think of it as similar to what we do with asset purchase—with asset runoff with QT.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"Again, haven’t made any decisions about that, but that’s certainly a possibility."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"Alternatively, as we approach levels that are plausibly neutral or close to neutral, it may turn out to be appropriate to slow the pace at which we’re dialing back restriction."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, for example, if we were to see the labor market deteriorating, we’d be prepared to move more quickly."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, as a general matter, as we move ahead, we are prepared to adjust our assessments of the appropriate pace and destination as the outlook evolves."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"Well, so I think if you look at the 3- and 6-month—you’re quoting the 12-month."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"I—look, I just think—the first question is, how long will they be sustained?"
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we haven’t, you know, made any decision like that at all."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,Or do you just take them as a given or perhaps a signal that you should do less?
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,Steve.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,You want to be able to make sensible decisions as you go.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I think there’s a fair amount of uncertainty about that, and, you know, you don’t want to tie yourself up with, with guidance."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"So the—the—the point is to find that, to find the right pace and the right destination as we go."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"The path that we’re on, we do know what—where the destination is, but we don’t know the right pace, and we don’t know exactly where the destination is."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, we’re—there’s a fair amount of uncertainty in that—in what I’ve said."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, saying “further progress” it becomes a test where we don’t want to be—we don’t think it’s a good time to be doing a lot of, of forward guidance."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,Neither of those is meant to send a further signal.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,And it’s not meant to send a signal.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"So that, I would tell you, is, is what that’s really all about."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"The point is we have gained confidence that, that we’re on a sustainable path down to 2 percent."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,Are you—are you making—are you requiring yet further guidance?” We have to say “yes” or “no” at every meeting whether we’ve made further progress.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s brand new forward guidance.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,STEVE LIESMAN.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"If you leave it in, then it’s new forward guidance."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"So the test of gaining further confidence was a—was our test for the first rate cut, right?"
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,So let me tell you what we were thinking.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"Not really, no."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,Is it meant to communicate anything about the stickiness of core inflation in the last three months?
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,Is it—is it meant to open the door to a December pause?
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,Is there any policy substance behind either of those changes in language?
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"I wondered if you could please elaborate and explain a little bit the two changes in the language of the statement here in the first paragraph when you say, “Inflation has made progress,” dropping the word “further progress,” and in the second paragraph dropping the sentence that the Committee had “gained greater confidence” that inflation was progressing towards its 2 percent goal."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,Howard Schneider with Reuters.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,HOWARD SCHNEIDER.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,Howard.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"And so we, we met that test in September, and therefore we take that test out."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"Steve Liesman, CNBC."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,“What do you mean by it?
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, you know, right now, we’re—there’s nothing to—there’s nothing to model right now."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"—we’re not doing that now, and all that will take time, and it will be very much regular order when we do do that."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"Mr. Chairman, you talked about higher rates, perhaps from an expectation of higher growth."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,Mm-hmm.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,So I think I would just say— STEVE LIESMAN.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"We don’t know what the policies are, and once we know what they are, we won’t—we won’t have a sense of, you know, when they’ll be implemented or, or all those sorts of things."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s such an early stage.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"If I could just follow up on Nick’s question—are the current rates something you feel like you need to lean against, in that they go against the direction of policy by being—adding restriction to the economy?"
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,And I just—this will be no different.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I think that’s a—that’s a process that takes a lot of time and that we go through all the time with every Administration, constantly."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"What’s the net effect and, you know, the overall effect on the economy at any given time?"
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s all of the policy changes that are happening.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"Clearly, the legislative process takes a lot of time."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, a law change of some kind would go in there, but—it would go in, but it would—you know, it’s a process that takes some time."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, of course, the real question is not the effect of that law."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,Many things are affecting it at any given time.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,You didn’t talk about it in terms of expectations of higher deficits.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"Is that something you think might be behind the recent rise in interest rates, and is that—are rising deficits a concern to you?"
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we don’t comment on fiscal policy, and, again, I don’t have a lot more to say on, on what’s driving bond yields."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,Let’s say Congress is considering a rewrite of the tax laws; it doesn’t matter what’s in the content.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,So we would follow that.
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"In terms of, of policy changes, though, let me give you a sense of how this, this works in the ordinary case."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"And then we’d wait, and we’d wait, and, at a certain point, the staff would brief the FOMC and say, you know, “This is—these are the likely effects.” There’s lots and lots of literature on the effects of tax policy changes on various parts of the economy."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we’d, we’d try to get smart on that."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"And then the law actually passes, and, you know, you’d start to put it—you’d probably run an alternative simulation before that happens, just to keep people trying to understand it."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"Then, then when it actually passes, it goes into the model, along with a million other things."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, you know, these—we have a very large economy."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,"At a certain point, we’d, we’d think we see the outline, so we’d start to model it."
2024-11-07,Press Conf - Full Text,STEVE LIESMAN.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I feel—I feel very good about where the economy is and the performance of the economy, and we want to keep that going."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,ANDREW ACKERMAN.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"The other thing I just wanted to ask about was the—you, you guys have noted that the unemployment rate is, is still low."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"However, employment rates have fallen rather quickly."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"The prime-age employment rate has fell by about half a point—half a percent, rather—recently."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"The question, I guess, is, do you think there’s maybe more downside momentum in the labor market than the unemployment rate alone is signaling?"
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, you know, we, we’re not allowed to own Bitcoin."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think, overall, if you look at it, prime-age participation is still very high."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"What, what’s going on in the labor market is that the hiring rate is low."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"So if you—if you have a job, you’re doing very well, and layoffs are very low, right?"
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"So people are not losing their jobs in large numbers, unusually large numbers."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"If you are looking for a job, though, the hiring rate is low, and that’s a signal of, of lower demand, and it has come down."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we look for signs like that, and that, that’s clearly a sign of softening, further softening."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"I didn’t mention it earlier, but I, I think you can see a, an ongoing gradual softening in the labor market."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"I don’t think so, no."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"And if you look around the world, there’s just a lot of slow growth and continued struggles with inflation."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Again, the U.S. economy has just been remarkable."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Again, not something we need to see to get 2 percent inflation."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"The Federal Reserve Act says what we can own, and we’re, we’re not looking for a, a law change."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"That’s the kind of thing for Congress to consider, but we are not looking for a law change at the Fed."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Andrew.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,ANDREW ACKERMAN.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"And it’s—when we, in these international meetings that I attend, this has been the story, is that how well the U.S. is doing."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hey, happy holidays, Mr. Chairman."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"I was wondering if you are satisfied with the way 2024 is ending, if you’re confident that we’ve avoided the recession that forecasters were predicting as inevitable a couple years ago."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,I think it’s pretty clear we’ve avoided a recession.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think growth this year has, has been solid, it really has."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"PDFP, private domestic final purchases, which, which we think is the best indicator of private demand, is looking to come in around 3 percent [real growth] this year."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,This is a really good number.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks for taking our questions.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, that’s part of the reason that explains why we moved ahead today with, with our, with the action, with, with an additional cut."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, it, it breaks down into a long answer, if you want, but it just has been a little bit more stubborn."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Wages are at a healthy and, and ever more sustainable level—wage growth."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Elizabeth.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,ELIZABETH SCHULZE.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thanks so much, Chair Powell."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Elizabeth Schulze from ABC News.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"As you’ve noted, the Fed is now forecasting higher inflation next year."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,High prices are still a burden for so many households right now.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Why do you think it is that inflation is proving to be more stubborn than you’d expected?
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think if you go back two or three years, many people were saying that to get this far down we would’ve had to have a, had a deep recession and, you know, high unemployment by now."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Well, that has not been the case, so, you know, the, the path down has actually been much better than many predicted."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"We, we’ve managed to, to have the unemployment rate remain essentially at its longer-run natural rate, while inflation has come down from—you know, core PCE inflation has come down from 5.6 percent to 2.8 percent on a 12-month basis."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"So that’s, that’s a pretty good outcome."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, if I may, speaking of assets that have—that have been buoyant, do you see any value or benefit in the U.S. government building a reserve of Bitcoin?"
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Why hasn’t it come down [more]?
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, and, you know, that’s, that’s how I would characterize it, and that’s why we’re paying careful attention."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Nonetheless, it’s, it’s one of our mandate goals, and, you know, we pay close attention to it, and it’s, it’s worth noting that it is still gradually cooling—gradually and in an orderly way."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, again, I, I don’t want to overstate the downside in the labor market, because the downsides clearly appear to have diminished."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"And so the labor market—this is a good, a good labor market, and, you know, we want to keep it that way."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Amara.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,AMARA OMEOKWE.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Amara Omeokwe from Bloomberg News.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,I just want to put a finer point on the labor market.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Can you keep the labor market this way, in the strong position that you have described, without further cuts?"
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"In other words, do you still view the labor market as needing support to protect against a further cooling?"
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, we, we can’t know that with any tremendous certainty."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"I, I will say that we think that, that our policy balances the risks—we think the risks are roughly in balance as between the two mandates, and we think the labor market is, is in solid shape."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"And when I say it’s softening or cooling, it’s very gradual process."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, job creations are, are meaningfully positive; wages are, you know, if anything, a little, still a bit above what would be sustainable if productivity were to revert to its longer-run trend."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"If you, if you take into account the high productivity readings we’ve had, then wages are already at a sustainable level relative to 2 percent inflation."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, but you take a step back, the level of unemployment is very low—again, participation is high."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,NEIL IRWIN.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"If, if the idea, though, is that no additional kind of softening in the labor market is welcome here, what’s to prevent that from happening if rates are still restrictive?"
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, a lot of things move financial conditions around, as you know, and we don’t really control those."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Steve.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,STEVE LIESMAN.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Mr. Chairman, I, I did not hear you use the word “recalibration” today."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,And I’m just wondering if the recalibration phase is over and what you might call this new phase and whether the criteria for changing rates is somehow different and higher than it was before.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,We’re not—we’re not renaming the phase—yet.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, no, I, I would say we, we are, though, in, in a new phase in the process, as I said."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, and that’s just because we’ve reduced—we’ve reduced our policy rate by 100 basis points."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,We’re significantly closer to neutral.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"We still think where we are is meaningfully, meaningfully restrictive, and I think from this point forward, you know, it’s appropriate to move cautiously and look for progress on inflation."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’ve, you know, we’ve done a lot to support economic activity by cutting 100 basis points, and that’s a good thing."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"I, I think it would—I support the decision, and, and I think it was the right decision to make."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,But we may get around to that.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,And so that’s how we think about it.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’ve now gotten to a place where, where the risks of the two are what we think are broadly, roughly in balance."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, for a while there we were only really focused mainly, mainly focused on, on inflation."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"One reason is that, that—just a technical issue around the way we calculate housing services, and that, that process has been slower than—market rents have, are showing up more slowly in that measure than we might have thought three, two, two years ago."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,But we don’t have that kind of precision in this.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, but you’re right, though, and I, I read out some of the reasons."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"We, we do think the labor market is still cooling by many measures, and we’re watching that closely."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s, it’s not cooling in a—in a quick or in a way that really raises concerns."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think, you know, you pointed out participants in the FOMC really thought that the risks and uncertainty had improved relative to the labor market."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"And it’s because of, because things have just gotten a little bit better, it doesn’t—the unemployment rate flat and things like that."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Nonetheless, you know, we’re watching it closely."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,COLBY SMITH.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I—what I said is, we don’t think we need further softening to get to 2 percent inflation."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"That’s what I’m saying, not that it’s not welcome."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"We don’t need it, we don’t think."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"If, if you had a situation where inflation’s moving around by a tenth every few months, that’s, you know, we’d have to weigh that against the fact that inflation has in recent months been moving sideways in the 12-month window."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"And so we’ve got to weigh them both, at this point."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think from now we are in a place where the risks really are in balance, and we need to see progress on inflation."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"And that’s, that’s how we’re thinking about it."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,So it is kind of a new thing.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"We moved pretty quickly to get to here, and I think going forward, obviously, we’re going to be moving slower, which is consistent with, with the SEP. STEVE LIESMAN."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thanks Chair, Chair Powell."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Neil Irwin from Axios.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Financial markets have been very buoyant, really all year."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Is the Committee comfortable with where financial conditions are, or do you see a risk that looseness in financial conditions could undermine progress on your inflation target?"
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we, we do look carefully at financial conditions, of course; that’s part of what we do."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, you know, we, we really look carefully at is the performance of our— of our goal variables and, and how are we affecting the economy."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,So what we’ve seen over the course of—just take the last year.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"We, we’ve seen inflation—well, over the last couple of years—come down a lot."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,We’ve seen the labor market cool off quite a bit.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,That suggests that our policy is restrictive.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’ve, we can also look more directly at, at the parts of the economy that are affected by—that, that are interest sensitive, like particularly housing."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Housing activity is, is very low, and that’s partly, significantly because of our policy."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,So we think our policy is working.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s transmitting, and it’s having the effects on our goal variables that we would want."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,NEIL IRWIN.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"But I’d say we, we see the effects we’re hoping to see on, on the goal variables and, and the places where we’d expect to see it."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Neil.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we need policy to remain restrictive to, to get—to get that work done, we think."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Wonder if I could follow up and ask you how much you or the Committee are looking through some of the high numbers we’ve had in the recent inflation numbers.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"For example, cars being up maybe because of the hurricanes, eggs because of the avian flu, that, that kind of stuff."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, and then looking forward, perhaps, to housing inflation coming down, as it did in the recent report."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we, yeah, we always try to be careful about not throwing out the numbers we don’t like, you know?"
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s just a, an occupational hazard is, is to [say], “Look, those high months are wrong.” What about the low months?"
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, we’ve got, we have a very low month, potentially, in November."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, it’s estimated by many to be in the mid-teens for core PCE."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,So that could be idiosyncratically low.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,We try to look—we try to look at not just a couple or three months.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"We shouldn’t have—our, our position shouldn’t change based on two or three months of good or bad data."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,We have a long string now of inflation coming down gradually over time.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"As I mentioned, 12-month, I think it’s 12-month headline’s 2½; 12-month core is 2.8."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s way better than we were.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"We still have some work to do, though, is how we’re looking at it."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,So that’s part of it.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, it appears to be settling in around, excuse me, 2½ percent."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we, we understand very well that prices went up by a great deal, and people really feel that."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we, what we had was—we had four months of really nice readings, and then September and October were higher, but then November is much lower."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,So I don’t really think the public is experiencing that as a surprising upside risk to inflation.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"I, I think inflation is much lower."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"What the public is feeling, and they’re right about it, is that prices are, are just—the price level went up, because of the past inflation."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"It is going to take some time to, for real wages to recover, over a period of years in which your, your real compensation is growing."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, in other words, your compensation’s growing meaningfully faster than inflation."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Yeah, so inflation—again, we don’t overreact to a couple of months of higher readings or a couple months of lower readings."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"That’s exactly the kind of economy we have now, and we just want to hold onto it."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I don’t think that, you know, a, a couple of months of higher inflation really signal that, anything of the nature you’re suggesting."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,KELLY O’GRADY.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,And just one follow-up: Let’s look more long-term.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,You previously predicted hitting the 2 percent inflation target in 2026.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s now been pushed out to 2027.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,You said you’re focused on enabling further progress on inflation.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"That, that process will probably take some years, but that’s, that’s what’s going on right now."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"But with inflation ticking up, how worried are you the progress in closing that gap could go away?"
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s partly why Americans haven’t felt much relief in their wallets from prices yet.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Do geopolitical risks factor in at all to how you’re thinking about energy prices?
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we, we monitor geopolitical risks really quickly, but, you know, but—really carefully, rather."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, you know, I would say so far those risks haven’t really— nothing has come out of those risks that really, has really been important for the United States economy."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"The single thing that you would look to is the price of oil, given that we’re talking about the Middle East and Ukraine, and, you know, and—but that, that is a good summary statistic for the kind of thing that could go wrong in, in, with global turmoil."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"But the price of oil’s been coming down, and, for, because of supply conditions, global supply conditions."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we don’t—the U.S. is not feeling, really, the effects of geopolitical turmoil, but we are at, certainly, at a time of elevated geopolitical turmoil."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"And it remains, you know, a risk."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Kelly.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,KELLY O’GRADY.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thanks, Chair Powell."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Kelly O’Grady from CBS News.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"I want to go back to something that you said a minute ago, that wage growth is outpacing inflation now."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"It wasn’t the case for some time, of course."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s not necessarily progress in the right direction.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Are you confident that target isn’t going to move further out?
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’re talking about—when you’re projecting the economy, you know, three years out, two years out, you’re talking about high uncertainty."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"No, we’re not going to settle for that."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think we’re, we’re, you know, we certainly have every intention and expectations that we’ll get inflation back sustainably to 2 percent."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,That is—and I am confident we will achieve that.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"It has taken longer, but it’s, you have to be—you know, we are making progress."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,We have made a great deal of progress.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,And we’ll continue to do so and get back to 2 percent inflation.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s what we owe the public.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, and, you know, we’re committed to achieving it."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"In that case, can you rule out a rate hike next year?"
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,You don’t rule things completely in or out in this—in this world.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,That doesn’t appear to be a likely outcome.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,I think we’re at 4.3 percent.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Do you think the Fed is just going to have to settle for that and accept that you’re not going to get to your 2 percent target?
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,VICTORIA GUIDA.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,So gradually declining.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Nancy Marshall-Genzer from Marketplace.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Very high uncertainty.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, we, we really—at that point it, it’s not, it’s not possible to confidently predict where the economy is going to be in three years."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,So what we’re doing is we’re looking at what’s happening now.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we’re kind of projecting that the same kinds of things are happening—so we, we keep a strong labor market, housing services inflation comes down, goods and services—goods inflation settles down, and, you know, nonmarket services return to their, their prior level."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"All of those things should happen over time, and, and, you know, those pieces come together."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,There’s every reason to think that they will.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,The timing of it is highly uncertain.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, but you’re not wrong, though, that, you know, we’ve, the— it’s been a bit frustrating because the—while we’ve made progress, it has been slower than we had hoped."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Nonetheless, we’re still on track."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, I think if you’d—if two, two years ago, you’d said, “we were [going to be] at 4.2 percent unemployment and 2.8 percent inflation,” people would be, would say, “I’ll take that.” I mean, that, that’s a pretty good interim place to be."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Job’s not done, but, but I think we’re, we’re feeling good about where we are and where we’re headed."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Go to Nancy for the last question.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Chair Powell."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"You said a couple times, inflation has been moving sideways."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think there are other, other parts of the story, but, you know, the, the—what, what I think people are feeling right now is the effect of high prices, not high inflation."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"But energy prices will come down, and then they will go up, and it won’t really be telling us anything about how tight the economy is and how, how future inflation will perform."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"So it—that, that’s why the two can go in different directions."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,So I’ll say a couple things.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"First of all, when we, when we write— the thing we write down in the Summary of Economic Projections is the longer-run neutral rate, which is the neutral rate at a time when supply and demand are in balance, the full economy’s in balance, and no shocks are hitting the economy."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,That is not where we are right now.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"So when we’re making monetary policy at the Fed, that’s not the question we’re asking."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,So you can’t do a straight read between those longer-run numbers that we write down and what we think the appropriate policy should be.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"What percent do you see, and the Committee believes—where is that neutral rate?"
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, basically, at any given time, various shocks are hitting the economy."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,And the answer can be that there are things that affect the economy that are—that are lasting but not permanent.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"And the, the ones that are permanent are the ones that would be in r*."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"The ones that are, could be lasting, but, but nonetheless go away over time, they could actually affect what, what’s sort of technically the appropriate neutral stance in near term."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we’re looking at that, and, you know, we don’t—we don’t know exactly where it is, but as I like to say, we know it by its works, and I think what, what we know for sure is that we’re 100 basis points closer to it right now."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"There are many estimates of where that might be, and we know we’re a lot closer to it, and I think we’re in a good place."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"But I think from here it’s a new phase, and we’re going to be, you know, cautious about, about further cuts."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"And so what we’re doing in, in real time is we’re looking at our policy stance, and we’re looking at the way it’s hitting the economy, and, particularly, we look at the effects it’s having as we try to move the economy toward maximum employment and price stability."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,So you say that we’re closer to the neutral rate.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Edward Lawrence from Fox Business.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thanks, Chair Powell, for doing the questions."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,And it’s prices of food and transportation and heating your home and things like that.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"So there’s tremendous pain in, in that burst of inflation that was very global."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,This was everywhere in all the advanced economies at the same time.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"So now we have—inflation itself is way down, but people are still feeling high prices, and that is—that is really what people are feeling."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"The best we can do for them—and that’s who we work for—is to get inflation back down to its target and keep it there so that people are earning, you know, big, real wage increases so that their, their wages are going up, their, their compensation is going up faster than inflation year upon year upon year."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,And that’s what will restore people’s good feeling about the economy.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"That’s what it will take, and that’s what we’re aiming for."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,ELIZABETH SCHULZE.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"And as we look ahead to next year, what do you see as the biggest challenge to the economy under the next Administration?"
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"I feel—I feel very good about where the economy is, and, honestly, I’m very optimistic about, about the economy, and it’s—we’re, we’re in a really good place; our policy’s in a really good place."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"I, I expect another good year next year."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Edward.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,EDWARD LAWRENCE.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,EDWARD LAWRENCE.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, but I think that the markets are looking for, for a little more clarity."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mean, I’ve heard estimates from 2.9 percent to 4 percent."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, I, I think the markets would like to see a little more clarity about a year out, 18 months out, as to where that, that goalpost, for lack of a better term, is, because at the moment, it looks big."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,So that’s the overall goal.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, as we know, headline inflation contains energy and food, and those prices can fluctuate for reasons that are not related to tightness in the economy and therefore are not really good predictors of future inflation."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"So it turns out that core inflation is, is a better predictor of overall inflation than overall inflation is."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we look at core inflation because it’s a better measure of what future inflation is like to be, likely to be, because it’s a better measure of, of what inflation pressures exist."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"So that’s, that’s—it’s complicated, but ultimately, we, you know, our goal is headline, not core."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"So your question was, your second question was what?"
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,VICTORIA GUIDA.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Why do you all see core going down but headline potentially ticking up?
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,So headline can be affected—you’re talking about next year.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,VICTORIA GUIDA.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Mm-hmm.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Yeah, so headline can, again, it can be affected by energy prices and food prices."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"So that, there, there will be things in, in the headline forecasts that are to do with forecasts of energy prices, whereas core will be—if, if you look at core going out a full year, then it’ll be much more driven by things like tightness in the economy."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"People don’t experience core inflation; they experience inflation, and that includes food and energy costs."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Headline has been lower, as you know, most of this year, but that’s because energy prices have been coming down, which is a great thing for people."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, and as, as I imagine you know, the, you know, the goal overall is headline inflation, because that’s what people experience."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Why, why do you all see core PCE going down and, potentially, headline inflation ticking up?"
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Yeah, I mean, honestly, we—you know, there are countless models of what—of what a neutral rate might be at any given time."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"There, there are empirical models, there are theoretical models, there are things that combine them, and they have as many different answers as you’d like."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,So there is no real certainty.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, I mean, it’s, it’s actually a good thing to know that we don’t know exactly where it is, so you’re not—you’re not tempted to think, “Oh, I think this model or this estimate is right.” You, you just have to be open to, you know, the empirical data that are coming in and also how it’s affecting the outlook."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"And it’s not made any easier by the fact that, you know, that our policy works with long and variable lags."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Nonetheless, that is the job we have, and so we’re, we’re— I think we need— it’s appropriate for us—for us now to proceed cautiously, now that we’re 100 basis points closer to, to neutral, and we’ll do so."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Meanwhile, the economy seems to be in, in good shape, and these cuts will certainly help to support economic activity and the labor market while we can still make progress on inflation, because policy is still meaningfully restrictive."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Victoria.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,VICTORIA GUIDA.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Hi, Victoria Guida with Politico."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,I just wanted to make sure I understood what you were saying at the beginning about inflation.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Are you saying that progress on core PCE counts as progress on inflation even if headline inflation ticks up?
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"And then also, since that’s what’s projected in the SEP, I was wondering, what accounts for that?"
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, you might—you might—if, if we have the, the breakeven level right, and if jobs continue—job creation continues at that level in the establishment survey, then you would get a tenth maybe every other month kind of thing."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I point you to, you’ll— there’s some language in the—in the “see- through” paragraph."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"And job creation is, is lower than it has been, but it’s been—it’s been steady—it’s not—it’s not declining."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,We’re significantly closer to neutral.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"At 4.3 percent and “change,” we believe policy is still meaningfully restrictive."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"But as for additional cuts, we’re going to be looking for further progress on inflation as well as continued strength in the labor market."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"And as long as the economy and the labor market are solid, we can be cautious about—as we consider further cuts."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"And all of that is reflected—to your question—in the December SEP, which shows a median forecast of down [to] two cuts next year, compared to four in September."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we’re—to, to cut further after this point, I, I would say it this way: We’ve reduced our policy rate now by 100 basis points."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Howard.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Howard Schneider with Reuters, and thanks for the opportunity to ask you a question."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"So this does seem similar to the dynamic in 2016 during the last transition to a Trump Administration, where the Committee saw slightly tighter policy in part in expected anticipation of the fiscal policy stance that was seen evolving over the year."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Some of it was a data mark-to-market exercise, and some of it was anticipation of fiscal."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,What’s the split on this one?
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"How much of this was accounting for inflation data that was coming in, and how much of it is expecting that there will be inflationary fiscal policy next year?"
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,HOWARD SCHNEIDER.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Like, what would—what would be the trigger to cut?"
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Sorry, just one, one quick follow-up: Why, I guess, would you make those cuts?"
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Inflation, we see that story as still broadly on track, and, and I’ll tell you why."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"We, we’ve made a great deal of progress."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Twelve-month core inflation, as I mentioned, through November is estimated at 2.8 percent, down from a high of 5.6 percent."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Twelve—but 12-month inflation has actually been moving sideways, as we are “lapping” very low readings of late last year."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Housing services inflation actually is steadily coming down now, albeit at a slower pace than we might like, but it has now come down substantially and it is making progress, slower than hoped."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"And we, we’ve had recent high readings from nonmarket services and some bumpiness for goods."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I’ll just say, we, we—so remember that we couple this decision today with the “extent and timing” language in the postmeeting statement that signals that we are at or near a point at which it will be appropriate to slow the pace of further adjustments."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,You ask about 2025.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"I, I think that the lower—the slower pace of cuts for next year really reflects both the higher inflation readings we’ve had this year and the expectation that inflation will be higher."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"You saw in the SEP that risks and, and uncertainty around inflation we see as higher."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Nonetheless, we, we see ourselves as, as still on track to continue to cut."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,I think the actual cuts that we make next year will not be because of anything we wrote down today.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’re, we’re going to react to data."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s just the general sense of what the Committee thinks is likely to be appropriate.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,JEANNA SMIALEK.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"I, I’d say—I’d, I’d point to five or six things, and, and I’d start—let me start by saying that we think the economy’s in a really good place, and we think policy’s in a really good place."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Let’s remember that the economy’s growing 2½ percent this year, that inflation has come down by 50 percent to, to—from 5.6 percent to 2.6 percent."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Headline inflation is 2.5 percent on a 12-month basis.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,We’re actually in a really good starting place here.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,HOWARD SCHNEIDER.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,If I could follow up on that: You mentioned the risk and uncertainty indexes toward the back of the document.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,The upside risk to inflation jumped quite substantially.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"The only thing, really, that’s happened—you, you mentioned that the disinflationary story remains intact, yet the risk weighting has jumped to the upside."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"The only real thing that’s happened is November 5th, in the meantime."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Is it fair to say that that’s what’s driving the higher sense of upside risk on inflation?
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Actually, that’s not the only thing that’s happened."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"What’s happened is that our forecast for inflation for this year, I think, are five-tenths higher than they were in September."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, you’ve got—you had two months of higher inflation, September and October."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"As I mentioned, November is, is back on track."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, you know, once again we’ve, you know, we’ve had a year-end projection for inflation and it’s kind of fallen apart as we’ve approached the end of the year."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,So that is certainly a large factor in people’s thinking.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,I can tell you that might be the single biggest factor is inflation has once again underperformed relative to expectations.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s still, you know, going to be between 2½ and 3 [percent]."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"But as, as I said, there’s a range of—range of approaches on the Committee."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we, we keep an eye on that."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,And so that may have affected some of the people.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s not unlike driving on a foggy night or walking into a dark room full of furniture.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"But since, you know—so, so what’s really driving the, the slower rate-cut path?"
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"First thing is growth is stronger, right?"
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"We, the economy grew faster in the second half of 2024, so far, than we had expected and is expected to be above what our expectations in September next year as well."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Unemployment is lower, and, you know, in the SEP, you’ll see that participants think that the—that the downside risks are less and uncertainty is less."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"And so that’s, that’s more strength, right?"
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Inflation is higher, as we talked about."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Inflation’s higher this year.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s also higher in the forecast next year.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"I’d also point out that we’re, we’re closer to the neutral rate, which is another reason to be cautious about, about further moves."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"And—but then getting to your—to your point, there’s also, there’s uncertainty—uncertainty around inflation, I pointed out, is actually higher."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s also—it’s also, in the case of some people, some people—the way I’d say it is this: Some people did take a very preliminary step and start to incorporate highly conditional estimates of economic effects of policies into their forecast at this meeting and said so in the meeting."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Some people said they didn’t do so, and some people didn’t, didn’t say whether they did or not."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,So we have people making a bunch of different approaches to that.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"But some did identify policy uncertainty as one of the reasons for their, their writing down more uncertainty around inflation."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, the point of that uncertainty is, it’s kind of commonsense thinking that when the path is uncertain you go a little bit slower."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,You just slow down.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s way below where it was.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,It’s still quite gradually cooling.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,We don’t think we need further cooling in the labor market to get inflation down to 2 percent.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"The unemployment rate is higher than it was a year ago, but, at 4.2 percent in November, it has remained low."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Nominal wage growth has eased over the past year, and the jobs-to-workers gap has narrowed."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Overall, a broad set of indicators suggests that conditions in the labor market are now less tight than in 2019."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,The labor market is not a source of significant inflationary pressures.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,The median projection for the unemployment rate in the SEP is 4.2 percent at the end of this year and 4.3 percent over the next few years.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Inflation has eased significantly over the past two years but remains somewhat elevated relative to our 2 percent longer-run goal.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Payroll job gains have slowed from earlier in the year, averaging 173,000 per month over the past three months."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Estimates based on the consumer price index and other data indicate that total PCE prices rose 2.5 percent over the 12 months ending in November, and that, excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 2.8 percent."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"The median projection in the SEP for total PCE inflation is 2.4 percent this year and 2.5 percent next year, somewhat higher than projected in September."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thereafter, the median projection falls to our 2 percent objective."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Our monetary policy actions are guided by our dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"We see the risks to achieving our employment and inflation goals as being roughly in balance, and we are attentive to the risks on both sides of our mandate."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"At today’s meeting, the Committee decided to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by ¼ percentage point, to 4¼-4½ percent."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’ve been moving policy toward a more neutral setting in order to maintain the strength of the economy and the labor market while establishing further progress in—sorry, enabling further progress on—inflation."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Longer-term inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters, as well as measures from financial markets."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"In the labor market, conditions remain solid."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"In our Summary of Economic Projections, Committee participants generally expect GDP growth to remain solid, with a median projection of about 2 percent over the next few years."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Overall, improving supply conditions have supported the strong performance of the U.S. economy over the past year."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"That’s, that’s meaningfully restrictive, and I, I think it’s a well-calibrated rate for us to continue to make progress on inflation while, while keeping a, a strong labor market."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Transcript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference December 18, 2024 CHAIR POWELL."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Good afternoon.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,My colleagues and I remain squarely focused on achieving our dual-mandate goals of maximum employment and stable prices for the benefit of the American people.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"The economy is strong overall and has made significant progress toward our, our goals over the past two years."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,The labor market has cooled from its formerly overheated state and remains solid.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Inflation has moved much closer to our 2 percent longer-run goal.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,We’re committed to maintaining our economy’s strength by supporting maximum employment and returning inflation to our 2 percent goal.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"To that end, today, the Federal Open Market Committee decided to take another step in reducing the degree of policy restraint by lowering our policy interest rate by ¼ percentage point."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,We also decided to continue to reduce our securities holdings.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,I’ll have more to say about monetary policy after briefly reviewing economic developments.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a—at a solid pace.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"GDP rose at an annual rate of 2.8 percent in the third quarter, about the same pace as in the second quarter."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Growth of consumer spending has remained resilient, and investment in equipment and intangibles has strengthened."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"In contrast, activity in the housing sector has been weak."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"With today’s action, we have lowered our policy rate by a full percentage point from its peak, and our policy stance is now significantly less restrictive."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,We can therefore be more cautious as we consider further adjustments to our policy rate.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,We know that reducing policy restraint too fast or too much could hinder progress on inflation.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"At the same time, reducing policy restraint too slowly or too little could unduly weaken economic activity and employment."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Jeanna.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,JEANNA SMIALEK.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Jeanna Smialek with the New York Times.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you for taking our questions.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"I, I wonder if you could talk a little bit about why officials think it’s appropriate to cut rates at all in 2025 if inflation is expected to remain firm throughout the year."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"And what would you expect, at this point, the timing might look like?"
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Would a January cut potentially be possible, or does a pause next month seem more likely?"
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Well, so let, let me start by saying why we—why we cut today and then—and then move to 2025."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I would say today was a—was a closer call, but we decided it was the right call because we thought it was the best decision to foster achievement of both of our goals, maximum employment and price stability."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"We see the risks as two-sided: moving too slowly and needlessly undermine economic activity and the labor market, or move too quickly and needlessly undermine our progress on inflation."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we’re trying to steer between those two risks, and, on balance, we decided to go ahead with a further cut."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I, I’ll give you some details on why."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Downside risks to the labor market do appear to have diminished, but the labor market is now looser than pre-pandemic, and it’s clearly still cooling further, so far in, in a gradual and orderly way."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Thank you, and I look forward to your questions."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Job creation is now well below the level or certainly below the level that would hold unemployment constant, the job-finding rate is low and declining, and other measures—such as surveys of workers and businesses, quits, things like that—broadly show a, a much cooler labor market than there was, than we had in 2019."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum-employment and price-stability goals.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"We understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"In considering the extent and timing of additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,We’re not on any preset course.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"In our Summary of Economic Projections, FOMC participants wrote down their individual assessments of an appropriate path for the federal funds rate, based on what each participant judges to be the most likely scenario going forward."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,The median participant projects that the appropriate level of the federal funds rate will be 3.9 percent at the end of next year and 3.4 percent at the end of 2026.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"These median projections are somewhat higher than in September, consistent with the firmer inflation projection."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"These projections, however, are not a Committee plan or decision."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"As the economy evolves, monetary policy will adjust in order to best promote our maximum-employment and price-stability goals."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"If the economy remains strong and inflation does not continue to move sustainably toward 2 percent, we can dial back policy restraint more slowly."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"If the labor market were to weaken unexpectedly or inflation were to fall more quickly than anticipated, we can ease policy more quickly."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Policy is well positioned to deal with the risks and uncertainties that we face in pursuing both sides of our dual mandate.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,On a technical note: We lowered the offering rate on our overnight reverse repo facility to align it with the bottom of the target range for the federal funds rate—its typical configuration.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Technical adjustments of this kind have no bearing on the stance of monetary policy.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,The Fed has been assigned two goals for monetary policy: maximum employment and stable prices.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"We remain committed to supporting maximum employment, bringing inflation sustainably to our 2 percent goal, and keeping longer-term inflation expectations well anchored."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Our success in delivering on these goals matters to all Americans.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Everything we do is in service to our public mission.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s been steady at a level which, as I pointed out a couple times, is actually below the level that would hold the unemployment rate constant, but it’s not so far below."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, you know, we really want to see progress on inflation, to, to, you know, as I mentioned, as we think about further cuts, we’re going to be looking for progress on inflation."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"That’s in part because inflation was very, very low measured in, in the 4th quarter of 2023."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Substantially better than our global peer group.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"And I, I—there’s no reason to think a downturn is, is any more likely than it—than it usually is."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, the outlook is pretty bright for our economy."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"We have to stay on task, though, and continue to have restrictive policies so that we can get inflation down to 2 percent."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,We’re also going to be looking out for the labor market.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,We want to keep the labor market pretty close to where it is.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"So the U.S. economy is just performing very, very well."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’re pretty close to estimates of the, the natural rate of unemployment."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,And so that’s what our policy’s trying to achieve.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHAEL MCKEE.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"If I could follow up by asking about—your formulation for beginning rate cuts included the phrase “we need to have confidence that inflation is moving down towards our target.” Given the fact that you’ve raised your forecast for next year, do you have confidence or are you uncertain about the path of inflation going forward?"
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"So confidence was our test for raising rates, and, you know, we’ve made—look, look at the broader suite: We’ve made just a great deal of progress."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’re, you know, we’re well into the 2’s in, in core inflation and around 2½ [percent]—or even lower than that, we have been—for headline inflation."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Job creation is, is a little below the, the level that would keep it there but, nonetheless, close."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Third and—second and third quarters were right about at the same level.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,It looks like it might be 2½ percent.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,So we have—we’re now well into another year of growth.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,There’s nothing really unusual about that.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"I think we need to, we need to see what they are and see what the effects they will have."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’ll, we’ll have a much clearer picture, I think, you know, when that happens."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.

2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Michael McKee from Bloomberg Radio and Television.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Even though you’ve cut rates by 100 basis points this year, we haven’t seen much change in mortgages, auto loan rates, or credit card rates."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,You say you’re significantly restrictive.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Are you running a risk that the markets are fighting against you and the economy could be more at risk of a slowdown than you anticipate?
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"So the, the risks that you—sorry, the rates that you talked about are, are really longer-run rates, and they’re affected, they are affected to some extent by Fed policy, but they’re also affected by many other things."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"And longer rates have actually gone up quite a bit since September, as, as you well know, and those are the things that drive, for example, mortgage rates more than short-term rates do."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we look at that, but we look at all financial conditions, and then we look at what’s happening in the economy."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"So what we see happening in the economy, again, is, you know, most forecasters have been calling for a slowdown in growth for a very long time, and it keeps not happening."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I, I would say I’m confident that inflation has come down a great deal, and I, I’m confident in the story about why it’s come down and why that portends well."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,And I’ll—and I’ll tell you why.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"You, again, you do see with housing services inflation, which is one that we’ve really worried, worried about, it really has come down now quite steadily, at a slower pace than we thought, you know, two years ago, but it’s nonetheless steadily coming down as, as market rents, you know, market rents start to equilibrate better with, you know, new leases that turn over."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Not, not new tenants, but new leases."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"It might take another year or two from here, but I, I’m confident that that’s the path we’re on."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, our policy will do everything it can to assure that that is the case."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Colby.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,COLBY SMITH.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Colby Smith with the Financial Times.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"So the unemployment rate as of November, while still very low, is within spitting distance of the level that generated a lot of concern about the labor market over the summer in the lead-up to the 50 basis point cut in September."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Hiring has also narrowed to just a handful of sectors.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,But now the Committee appears comfortable skipping cuts at upcoming meetings.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,So what has changed about the Committee’s assessment of the risks confronting the labor market?
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Is there just less concern now on that front, or is it just about there being more upside risk to inflation that now needs to be accounted for?"
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"The, the unemployment rate has now—is now the same as it was in July: 4.2 percent."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s moved up and down, but it’s now the same as July."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we and most other forecasters still feel that we’re on track to, you know, to get down to 2 percent."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, I just would emphasize the uncertainty, which is, it’s just—it’s just a function of the fact that, that we expect significant policy changes."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s real inflation, but it doesn’t portend persistently high inflation."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,So what’s the story?
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Market rents is new leases.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"So that, that’s happening; that process is ongoing pretty much as we expect."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Goods inflation, which is another big piece of it, has returned right to the range where it was before the pandemic."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Just for some months this year it kind of moved up in a bumpy way because of used cars and things like that.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"But we think, overall, that should generally be in the range it was in."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Then that leaves nonhousing services, and market-based nonhousing services are in, in good shape."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s nonmarket services, and those are—those are services that are imputed rather than measured directly, and they, they don’t, we, we think they don’t really tell us much about the, you know, about tightness in the economy."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,They don’t really reflect that.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mean, a good example is financial services, which is really done off of asset prices, and that just—so that, that’s how that inflation works."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"So the overall picture, the story of why inflation should be coming down, is still intact."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"In particular, the labor market—look at the labor market."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"It’s, it is cooler by so many measures now—modestly cooler than it was in 2019, a year when inflation was well under 2 percent."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,So it’s not a source of inflationary pressures.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Not to say there aren’t regional and, and, you know, particular professions where labor is tight."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"But, overall, you’re not getting inflationary impulses of any significance from the labor market."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"The story is still just, we’re unwinding from these large shocks that the economy got in 2021 and ’22 in, for example, housing services, and now also in, in insurance, in particular, where costs went up, and those are now being reflected later in housing insurance."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,We have been moving sideways on 12-month inflation as the 12-month window moves.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"You know, we are, we’re trying to make sensible policy as we go."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"So that, that’s what we mean by that."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"What the Committee’s doing now is, is discussing pathways and understanding, again, the ways in which tariff-driven inflation can affect—tariffs can affect inflation and the economy, and, and how to think about that."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"So, we’re, we’re—we’ve done a bit of, good bit of work, all of us have, each of us has, and, you know, it puts us in position, when we finally do see what the, what the actual policies are, to be, to make, you know, a more, more careful, thoughtful assessment of what might be the appropriate policy response."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,CHRIS RUGABER.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Great, and just a quick follow[-up]."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Do you, given the recent bout of inflation that we’ve been through, with consumers seeing how, you know, prices can rise and businesses being—seeing that they can raise prices, at least for some time, does that make it a little bit riskier to look through tariffs?"
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"I mean, are—do you feel that you have to respond more quickly to inflation threats, given what we’ve seen the past few years?"
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"We, we won’t face that question—we don’t know when we’ll face that question."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,How persistent will that be?
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, so, we just—we just don’t know, really, very much at all about the actual policies, so it’s very premature to try to make any kind of conclusion."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"We don’t know what’ll be tariffed, from what countries, for how long, and what size."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"We don’t know whether there’ll be, you know, retaliatory tariffs."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"We don’t know what the, you know, the transmission of any of that will be into consumer prices."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"To your—to your point as well, I don’t—I wouldn’t say that we know whether the last episode is or is not a good model for what happened."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"So the, the main thing is—and this is also a point in these alternative simulations—is that there’re just many, many factors that go into what, what—how much tariffs will, will even go into consumer inflation."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"In any case, this is not a question that’s in front of us right now."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"It says, you know, it considers situations in which it might be appropriate to “see through” inflation and then, and then names some conditions that in, in which it might not be."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, there, there were two simulations: one was—one was “seeing through,” one was not."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Nonetheless, as we go forward, we’re going to want to be seeing further progress on bringing inflation down and keeping a solid labor market."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Chris.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,CHRIS RUGABER.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Thank you.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Chris Rugaber at Associated Press.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Thanks for taking the question.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"In September 2018, the Fed staff in the Tealbook discussed a policy of “looking through” any new tariffs as long as they were one-time increases and inflation expectations remained anchored."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Could you comment on if that analysis remains effective and any other thinking on tariffs generally that you can share?
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"So I do think that the 2018, the September 2018 Tealbook alternative simulations are a good place to start."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,I happened to have brought them here with me today.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,I’m sure you have them too.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"They’re, they’re a good starting point, and, and I would just say, you know, it’s six-years-old analysis."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"But nonetheless, this is still, I think, I think the right, the right questions to ask."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,You pointed out we’ve just been through a period of high inflation.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,We’ve just gotten through that period.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,That’s a difference.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"It was also quite a bit of diversion of trade away from China to other countries, since that, that may—that may have affects."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,That would be meaningful.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"We, we also have to think about the, the, you know, the labor market."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"And while we, we have the labor market forecast as being in good shape, we are also mindful that it is still out there very gradually cooling, so far in an orderly, gradual way."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,But it’s also something we need to keep our eye on.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,NICK TIMIRAOS.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"I, I guess, if I could follow up: If somebody looked at these projections and also the insertion of the “extent and timing” language in the statement, which has been used at times in the past when the Committee thinks maybe it’s going to be on hold for a while, and they said, “Gee, this looks like it could be the last rate cut for some time,” would they be mistaken to, to infer that?"
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"So that’s, that’s not the—that’s not any decision that we’ve made at all."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Let me explain “extent and timing.” So the, the sense of that wording is to make clear that if the economy does evolve about as anticipated, we’re at a point at which it would be appropriate to slow the pace of rate cuts."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"So “extent,” that just relates to how, how much further we can reduce our policy rate consistent with getting to a neutral stance."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Clearly, that distance has shrunk by 100 basis points."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,So it’s significantly smaller.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"So that’s, that’s the “extent” question."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, again, we’re going to be looking for further progress on inflation, as well as a strong labor market, to make those cuts."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"“Timing” just suggests, again, that we’re at a place where we, we, assuming the economy develops as expected, we’re at or near a level that will make it appropriate to slow the pace of adjustments."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"This year, [it] will be 2.8 or 2.9."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,We’re not trying to make decisions about the longer run.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"That wouldn’t be all the way to 2 percent, but that would be, it would be, you know, better than this year."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,I think that does take on board that we want to see real progress.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,I don’t know.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"I just think we, we need to take our time, not rush, and make a very careful assessment, but only when we’ve actually seen what the policies are and how they’re implemented."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"And, you know, we’re just—we’re just not at that stage."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"We’re at the stage of doing what other forecasters are doing—which is kind of thinking about these questions, but not, not trying to get to definitive answers for some time."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,MICHELLE SMITH.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Nick.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,NICK TIMIRAOS.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Nick Timiraos, the Wall Street Journal."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"Chair Powell, to make sure I understand, participants today revised up their core PCE inflation projection for ’25 so that the central tendency runs from 2½ to 2.7 percent, and, as Howard noted earlier, most of the Committee sees the risks to those projections to the upside."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"So if inflation only declines next year from 2.8 to 2.5 to 2.7, what would compel the Committee to be cutting in that situation?"
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,CHAIR POWELL.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,Let me—let me find these numbers.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"So we have—we have inflation coming down, core inflation coming down to 2½ [percent] next year."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"That’s, that’d be—that’d be significant progress."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,You see a slower path.
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,"But we, we, you know, we’d be seeing meaningful progress to get inflation down to that level."
2024-12-18,Press Conf - Full Text,So—Thank you very much.
